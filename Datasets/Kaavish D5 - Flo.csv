Hello ,"Hello! My name is Mai, how can I help you today?",
"I had some questions about my periods, will you be able to help me?","Sure, in fact you have reached the right person as I have quite a lot of information on menstrual health. What questions do you have for me?",
I wanted to know what an ovary is?,"The ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands located on either side of your uterus. They produce and store your eggs (also called ovum) and make hormones that control your menstrual cycle and pregnancy. During ovulation, one of your ovaries releases an egg. If a sperm fertilizes this egg, you can become pregnant. Your ovaries continue to release an egg each menstrual cycle until you reach menopause. I hope that answers your question",1
I was wondering what uterus looks like,The uterus is a hollow muscular organ located in the female pelvis between the bladder and rectum. The ovaries produce the eggs that travel through the fallopian tubes. Once the egg has left the ovary it can be fertilized and implant itself in the lining of the uterus.,1
What happens in a menstrual cycle ,"A menstrual cycle starts on the first day of the period and ends at the start of the next period. An entire menstrual cycle usually lasts between 24 and 38 days, but menstrual cycles can vary from person to person, cycle to cycle, and may also change over the years. Some people notice changes in their hair, skin, poop, chronic disease symptoms, mood, migraine headaches, or even in the way they experience sex at different points in the menstrual cycle. The cycle involves Uterine cycle and Ovarian Cycle",1
I am not sure if I understood what a uterine cycle is,"Before Ovulation, this cycle physically changes the uterus. 
This is the stage where menstruation happens and it happens during the period – from the time vaginal bleeding starts to the time it ends. Blood from the previous cycle  from inside the uterus is shed through the cervix and vagina. The uterine lining, called the endometrium, is thinnest during this phase. A typical period may last up to 8 days, but on average lasts about five or six.

There are hormones that are involved and those are estrogen and progesterone. Levels of estrogen and progesterone are typically at their lowest. This causes the top layers of the lining to release and leave the body. After ovulation, this involves the Secretory Phase. The Secretory Phase is rom ovulation until the start of the next period. The endometrium (uterine lining)gets ready to support a pregnancy or to break down for menstruation. The cells of the lining make and release many types of chemicals. In this stage, progesterone rises. This causes the uterine lining to stop thickening and prepare for a fertilized egg. Prostaglandins, “PGF2α” and “PGE2”, cause the uterine muscle to cramp. These hormones rise after ovulation and are highest during a period. Cramping helps start the period. Blood vessels shrink and the uterine lining breaks down. The uterine cells produce less of these chemicals if pregnancy happens.",1
Is the ovarian cycle also part of the menstrual cycle? ,"Yes it is! Before ovulation, the ovarian cycle physically changes the ovaries. Would you like to know what are stages of ovarian cycle?",1
Yes I want to know the stages in the ovarian cycle,"Following are the phases

Follicular phase. It starts from the start of the period until ovulation.Throughout the menstrual cycle, there are multiple follicles (fluid filled sacs containing eggs) at different stages of development in both ovaries. The period ends about halfway through this phase. One follicle in one of the ovaries becomes the largest of all the follicles. It is called the dominant follicle and is about the size of a grain of sand ( 1-2 cm or 0.4-.8 in). This follicle is the one prepared to be released at ovulation. For most people, the follicular phase lasts 10-22 days, but this can vary from cycle-to-cycle.

The hormone active here is the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) which is produced in the pituitary gland (a small area at the base of the brain that makes hormones) . FSH tells the ovaries to prepare an egg for ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary). The dominant follicle produces estrogen as it grows, which peaks just before ovulation happens. ",
What happens after ovulation?,"After ovulation, this cycle includes the Luteal Phase. The luteal phase occurs from ovulation until the start of the next period. The luteal phase lasts about 14 days, but between 9 and 16 days is common. After ovulation, the follicle that held the egg turns into something called a corpus luteum. It makes the hormones progesterone and estrogen to support pregnancy. If pregnancy does not happen, the corpus luteum breaks down between 9 and 11 days after ovulation. The hormone involved is progesterone which supports early pregnancy if an egg and sperm connect. If no pregnancy happens, progesterone will peak and then drop. These hormonal changes can contribute to common premenstrual symptoms. Common symptoms are mood changes, headaches, acne, bloating, and breast tenderness. A drop in progesterone and estrogen causes menstruation.",
Can I ask you general questions regarding periods?,Yes! Don't hesisate at all because that is what I am here for. ,
Why can my period change?,"Periods fluctuate for a while after they first start. But if you’ve had your period for a few years, it should generally be about the same length and volume each cycle. You may still notice changes from time to time, though — the heaviness and length of your period depends on your hormones, which can fluctuate. Hormones can change temporarily because of things like stress, over-exercising, diet, or taking an emergency contraception pill.  Your period will also have variations if you don’t ovulate each cycle—you may miss a period, or it may come later than usual, and/or be heavier or lighter and shorter or longer than your usual. Not ovulating during each cycle—anovulation—is common during adolescence and perimenopause, and is a common cause of temporarily absent and/or heavy menstrual periods.",1
Can periods fluctuate because of health conditions?,"Yes, periods can also fluctuate because of certain health conditions, like uterine polyps, fibroids, or PCOS—conditions that should be addressed with your healthcare provider. Certain bleeding conditions and medications can also affect menstrual bleeding.",
Do you suggest if I should track my period or not,"Tracking your period can help you understand the patterns of symptoms that you experience throughout your menstrual cycle—from pain, to cravings, to sex drive. Tracking can give you a better idea of when you are fertile, which may be helpful if you’re trying to become pregnant.",1
What are irregular cycle lengths,"For adolescents, the cycles outside the range of 21–45 days and for adults, cycles outside the range of 24–38 day or cycles that vary in length by more than 7–9 days (for example, a cycle that is 27 days long one month, 42 the next). If periods that suddenly stop for more than 90 days (exceptions include pregnancy, menopause, and recently discontinued hormonal birth control), this counts as irregular cycle length too. Do you want to know why ",1
Why do they happen,"Here are some of the more common reasons that cycles become irregular. Different causes lead to different types of irregularities.

Life stages and pregnancy
After menarche (the 2–3 years after menstruation begins)
Perimenopause (as cycles come to an end)
Pregnancy
The postpartum period (after a pregnancy)
Breastfeeding
Recurrent miscarriages (known or unknown) 
Sleep/wake cycles

Shift work or working night shifts
Sleep disorders
Jet lag/long-distance travel 
Physical/emotional changes

Chronic stress
Intensive exercise
Substance use/abuse
Quick weight changes
Eating disorders (not getting enough calories, binge eating)
Certain medications 
Medical conditions that can cause irregular cycles

Polycystic ovary syndrome
Thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism)
Unmanaged diabetes
Infections of the reproductive tract
Uterine polyps
Uterine fibroids
Abnormalities of the cervix or vagina
Certain cancers or benign tumors
Primary ovarian insufficiency (early menopause)
Bleeding disorders
Other medical conditions

Why do irregular periods matter,"Cycles that are continually irregular can have a serious impact on short- and long-term health. They can lead to a wide range of more serious health conditions, and cause distressing symptoms. Menstrual cycle health is related to your heart health, metabolism, sleep, fertility, and more. This is why it's important to have any potential issues diagnosed as early as possible, and managed with the help of a healthcare provider.",1
I am worried my period is late,"A lot of people feel concerned when their periods don’t show up on time, so I understand why you might be worried. However, there’s no need to worry just yet. There could be a number of reasons as to why your period might be late. These could include:

Stress
Travel
Diet
Illness
Medication
Birth control
Keeping track of changes to your lifestyle and environment can help you pinpoint why you might be experiencing variations in your menstrual cycle. Doing this daily can help you become more aware of what’s happening and let you know if there’s anything you should bring up with your healthcare provider.",1
Can you tell me about vaginal discharge,"Vaginal discharge is any non-period fluid that leaves your vagina. It is mostly water. There are also tiny microorganisms, including bacteria, present. This discharge helps the body remove old cells from the vagina and protects vaginal tissues from infection. Vaginal discharge changes in the way it looks and feels throughout the cycle.

Discharge can include vaginal lubrication, arousal fluid, semen after having sex, and cervical fluid, or possibly discharge from bacterial growth or an infection. 

You may notice more or less vaginal discharge throughout your cycle and during different stages of your life, such as after giving birth or during menopause.  ",1
So what is cervical fluid?,"Cervical fluid is produced by the cells of your cervix. The cervix is the opening to the uterus from the vagina. Cervical fluid can change throughout your cycle from thick, creamy, and sticky to thin, wet, and slippery. 

When the hormone estrogen increases right before ovulation, cervical fluid thins. This makes it easier for sperm to move through the cervix. This thinning may make it look like there is an increase in discharge and it may seem stretchier. When the hormone progesterone increases, cervical mucus thickens.",1
I would also like to know what is arousal fluid,"Lubrication fluid is filtered from blood plasma (the liquid part of blood minus the blood cells) (Pastor). Sexual arousal (excitement) causes extra blood to flow to the tissue of the vagina. There is more pressure in the swollen tissue and this causes the fluid to be pushed to the surface of the vaginal walls. This increase in moisture, or “wetness”, is vaginal lubrication or arousal fluid.",1
"I am confused, are female ejaculation and squirting the same thing?","No, they’re not. Female ejaculate (FE) is the release of a few milliliters of thick white fluid that is produced by the Skene’s glands, an organ on either side of the urethra (where urine leaves the body). It is released from the urethra. FE is not urine. Some people with vulvas report ejaculation happening before or after and with or without orgasm.

Squirting is the release or gushing of about 10 ml or more of clear fluid from the urethra, usually during orgasm or high arousal. The fluid in squirting is similar to urine and comes from the bladder. Both FE and squirting can happen at the same time. Not everyone will experience FE and/or squirting, and that’s normal too.",1
Does sex affect vaginal discharge?,"Before, during, and after sex, you may notice your vagina feels wetter. This can be due to arousal fluid, lube, or if you had penis-in-vagina sex without a condom, semen. You may notice semen coming out of the vagina right after sex or during the hours following sex. Semen is usually a gray-white, cloudy, jelly-like liquid. Spotting after sex could happen because of dryness or irritation, but it could also be caused by your cervix being swollen from an infection.",1
Does birth control affect vaginal discharge?,"Hormonal birth control can affect vaginal discharge. Birth control that contains progestin (a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone) can make cervical fluid thicker, which makes it harder for sperm to get through the cervix. If you are having this kind of birth control, then you may see thicker or less vaginal discharge because of this",1
Do pregnancy and breastfeeding affect vaginal discharge?,"Changing levels of the hormone estrogen during pregnancy, postpartum (after birth), and breastfeeding can cause vaginal dryness for some people. But worry not, using a lubricant can help make sex more pleasurable or comfortable if vaginal dryness is bothersome. Your healthcare provider can talk to you about more treatments for vaginal dryness such as synthetic estrogen (estradiol) hormone cream.",1
Can menstrual cycle affect vaginal discharge,"Yes it can! The menstrual cycle and related hormones can affect vaginal discharge. These changes may show up differently for you, or you may experience or interpret them in a different way. Would you like to know more about it?
",
How is my vaginal discharge during my periods,"During your periods, it will be in the form of bleeding (menstruation). On day one of the cycle, the first day of your period, levels of both estrogen and progesterone are low. The cervix is not producing much fluid at this time, but this won’t be noticed much since there is period bleeding.",1
How is it after periods,"Just after a periods, the discharge is absent and dry. Estrogen is produced by a small sac in the ovary holding an egg, called a follicle. Estrogen slowly increases after the period ends. There may be less cervical fluid for a couple of days after your period ends until estrogen increases again. ",
Will it change after periods and before ovulation,"The days between your period and ovulation, this discharge will become sticky, white and creamy. Estrogen levels are rising quickly now and the cervix produces more fluid. At first, discharge may look thick and sticky. Then it may become more wet and creamy, like a lotion. Discharge during this time can look whitish and cloudy, or even yellowish (especially if it’s dry on your underwear). In a 28-day menstrual cycle, you may first notice this fluid around day nine or ten. This is just an estimate. People have different cycle lengths and ovulation can vary from cycle to cycle, even in people who feel their cycles are predictable",
How will it look like near and during ovulation?," A few days before and during ovulation, it will be clear, wet, slippery, and stretchy. There is a lot of cervical fluid during the days right before ovulation. Your vagina will likely start to feel much wetter. There is more cervical fluid during this time and this is typically very slippery. This is caused by estrogen peaking one to two days before ovulation. Discharge may look like raw egg whites that can be stretched for inches between your thumb and finger",
What does it look like when ovulation is over and periods are yet to come,"After ovulation until the start of the next period bleeding, the discharge is sticky and dry. As soon as ovulation is over, vaginal discharge decreases. The hormone progesterone is higher and this decreases the release of fluid from the cervix and discharge may become tacky, dry, or absent ",
Do I have a yeast infection?,"Vaginal yeast infections happen when too much of a fungus called candida grows in the vagina. You may have a yeast infection if you have burning, itching, redness, and notice white, clumpy discharge that seems uncommon for you",1
Is it ok for discharge to smell?,"Vaginal discharge has a subtle smell. If your discharge starts to have a very strong odor or “fishy” smell, this could be related to an overgrowth of bacterial cells. Pain, itching, or burning around the vulva or vagina are not typical, and following up with your healthcare provider can help",1
How do I get rid of vaginal discharge? ,"Discharge is a part of the menstrual cycle. There is no need to get rid of the discharge that is typical for your body. If you feel like you are having an increased amount or the odor of your discharge is stronger than you expect, you can reach out to a healthcare provider for guidance. Washing with unscented soaps, not cleaning the inside of the vagina with a douche, and cleaning all menstrual cups, sex toys, diaphragms, as well as using condoms during sex can help prevent infections and keep the vaginal microorganisms in the common range",1
When should I worry about my vaginal discharge?,"There are times when changes in vaginal discharge are signs of infections or changes in hormones. Consider talking to your healthcare provider if you see any of the following:

Consistency: unusually thin, or thick and more textured/chunky
Color: gray, green, yellow, or brown
Volume: significant and unexpected in volume
Smell: fishy, metallic, or foul
Pain, itching, redness, or swelling of the vulva
If you feel embarrassed to talk to your healthcare provider about any changes in your body–remember that every body is different and only you know what is out of the ordinary for you.

What is Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)?,"It’s common not to have heard about bacterial vaginosis (BV) until you notice an issue with your own fluid and start googling. BV happens when the normal balance of vaginal bacteria is replaced by high numbers of anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that don’t need oxygen to grow). The most common type of BV-causing bacteria is called Gardnerella (don’t confuse it with the STI gonorrhea if you see it on your clinical report). The digestion processes of the new bacterial community create different byproducts and environmental changes, which can lead to symptoms from a fishy or unpleasant odor to itching, discomfort and inflammation. An immune response is also triggered in the vagina and can degrade the vagina’s naturally protective mucus. This can make the reproductive tract more prone to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like HIV and chlamydia. 

",1
Are there any impacts of bacterial vaginosis other than on your body?,"In many cases, the most significant impacts of symptomatic BV are emotional and social. This is especially true for people whose BV is recurrent (having it multiple times, despite treatment). One study found that, depending on the severity and frequency of symptoms, BV can lead people to feel “…embarrassed, ashamed, “dirty” and ""very concerned"" others may detect their malodor and abnormal discharge”. It can affect a person’s self-esteem and sex life, and they may avoid sexual activity (especially receptive oral sex) altogether. Recurrent symptoms, without an understanding of the reason, can be frustrating and make someone feel out of control.",
Can untreated BV lead to complications?,"While BV doesn’t usually lead to health complications, untreated BV can sometimes lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, infection after gynecologic surgery and pregnancy complications including miscarriage and preterm birth",
How common is this?,"Bacterial vaginosis is commonly seen in women of reproductive age, although the disease is not limited to any age. The prevalence of BV varies widely amongst demographics, and is tied to sociodemographic characteristics including race, ethnicity, education and income",1
What are the causes for bacterial vaginosis,"The exact causes of bacterial vaginosis are still unclear. Vaginal homeostasis can be disrupted by both internal factors (ex. antibiotics, diet) and external factors (ex. soap, semen), but it isn’t fully understood why one person gets recurrent BV in a particular situation when another doesn’t. Prolonged or irregular uterine bleeding may also be a contributor. This may happen because uterine blood changes the pH of the vagina to be slightly less acidic and/or because red blood cells provide more opportunity for lactobacilli to be carried out of the vagina. Recurrent BV may pop up around the time of menstruation for the same reason. The use of hormonal contraceptives in general, including “the pill”, has been shown to have a protective effect against BV.

Sexual activity is also associated with a higher risk of BV. Specific risk factors may include new or multiple sex partners, a lack of condom use, vaginal intercourse and receiving anal sex before vaginal intercourse without a new protective barrier",1
How to prevent bacterial vaginosis,"Vaginal bacteria can sometimes get out of balance and then improve on its own. To prevent BV, start by limiting your risk factors. Use condoms, don’t douche and keep all soap away from your vulva and vagina (some experts say non-foaming unscented soap is okay on the vulva, and others say stick to water). Don’t use any products with scents or perfumes in that area, and limit your bubble baths.

Often though, symptoms will persist or recur and need to be treated. Finding the source of the issue would be most helpful, but this is often difficult when so little is known about the causes of BV.",1
How to treat bacterial vaginosis,"Treatment of BV can range from antibiotics and antiseptics, to medications to restore acidity, to probiotics (find an in-depth discussion on current treatment here). Some treatments are available over the counter, but others will need a prescription. Tracking your symptoms, especially when they begin may help you and your healthcare provider identify triggers.

Unfortunately, it’s common for BV to return after treatment. The lack of understanding of what causes BV means treatments still have a long way to go to be effective in the long term. The FDA estimates the post-treatment “cure rate is under 4 in 10, with between 3 and 8 people having recurrence within several months. Limiting risk factors after treatment can help—talk to your healthcare provider about options.",
Can talking about it with others help?,"If you’re up to it, talk about BV with your partners and friends. The lack of awareness around it is staggering considering just how common it is. Bringing knowledge of BV into public awareness helps prevent the stress that can come with having it.",
Why is my vagina dry? ,"The hormone estrogen helps to keep the vagina moist and to maintain the thickness of the vaginal lining. Atrophic vaginitis (vulvovaginal atrophy) is a common condition that can occur when the ovaries produce a decreased amount of estrogen, which includes the prominent symptom of vaginal dryness.

Your body produces less estrogen:
At the time of menopause—then it is classified as genitourinary syndrome of menopause
After having a baby, particularly if breastfeeding
Medications which interfere with reproductive hormone regulation, such as those which treat breast cancer or certain gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists.
Removal of the ovaries, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy of the pelvis
Vaginal lubrication and sex
If you’re noticing dryness during vaginal sex, this could be for a number of reasons. Maybe what your partner is doing just doesn’t turn you on. If you feel turned on but are still dry, your body might simply need time to catch up with your brain. If you’re noticing vaginal dryness along with a lack of sexual desire, you may be experiencing low libido, which can be caused by a number of factors including medication and health conditions. Or you just might not be all that into your partner or the acts you are performing together.

",1
Why is my sexual desire fluctuating?,"Your sexual desire is influenced by some of the same hormones that fluctuate with your cycle, like estrogen and progesterone. You may find your desire tends to increase in the days leading up to ovulation and decrease after ovulation is over. Sex drive may be lower when more progesterone is produced during the luteal phase (the days after ovulation and leading up to menstruation). Exactly how reproductive hormones influence desire and preference isn’t the same for everyone; some people report a higher sex drive as part of their premenstrual experience, while other present with decreased libido. Tracking desire throughout your cycle can help you discover what’s true for you.",
What are treatments for vaginal dryness,"If you’re experiencing dryness since being on medication or a form of hormonal birth control: talk to your healthcare provider about trying another one that’s a better fit for your body.
If you suspect your dryness could be caused by low estrogen levels, there are several treatment options: vaginal moisturizers or lubricants, local vaginal estrogen cream or tablet,  systemic estrogen (and progesterone) therapy, or sometimes selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). See your healthcare provider to find out what’s the best option for you.
If what your sexual partner is doing doesn’t work for you: you could try discussing your sexual likes and dislikes—you may even find that just talking about it increases your arousal. If you lack desire for your partner, it’s up to you what you do from there, whether you want to re-evaluate your relationship or investigate any health issues that might be messing with your libido.
If you feel turned on but you’re not wet: spending more time on foreplay can be one way to increase your natural lubrication. Another option is to use personal lubricant (lube) during sexual activity or masturbation.",1
Are there any uncommon reasons for vaginal dryness,"Aside from sexual arousal and estrogen levels, there are additional factors that can affect vaginal lubrication:

Vaginal dryness can be a side effect of some medications and contraceptives. Talk to your healthcare provider to find out if the source of your vaginal dryness could actually be your medication or contraception.  
Cigarette smokers have been shown to have an increased risk of an earlier menopause transition as compared to non-smokers. This means that atrophic vaginitis symptoms may appear at a younger age in this population.
Sjögren’s syndrome could be another cause of possible vaginal (and other symptoms of dryness). This is an autoimmune disease where the body’s glands aren’t able to produce enough moisture.
If you’ve checked out everything else and still don’t find the culprit, you might have an allergy to chemicals in soap, detergent, lubricant or hygiene products—these can also cause vaginal dryness or irritation. Try switching to natural products and wash with unperfumed soap or just water, and see if your symptoms improve.

",1
Does my vagina need cleaning?,"Your vagina is self-cleaning, so there is no need to use any internal washes (douches) or vaginal deodorants—in fact, they can be harmful. Research has linked the practice of douching with increased risk of bacterial and yeast infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, increased transmission of STIs, upper genital tract infections, endometritis (inflammation of the lining of the uterus), and other adverse health outcomes",
How to identify abnormal discharge,"Atypical (abnormal) discharge can be an indication of a problem, such as Bacterial Vaginosis, a yeast infection, or an STI like trichomoniasis. Here are some indicators of abnormal discharge:

Color: Grayish, greenish, yellowish, brownish
Volume: Significant amount, often with other symptoms like itching
Consistency: Fluid becomes way thinner, or thicker and more textured
Smell: Unpleasant, fishy, metallic
Excluding atypical discharge, it’s normal to notice different types of vaginal fluid throughout your cycle, as well as during and after sexual activity.",1
How does my body change before my first period,"Before you get your first period, you might notice changes in your:
Nipples/breasts: Changes to your nipples and breasts may be the first thing you notice. In the beginning, the small bumps around your nipples become raised. Then, the darker area of your nipples will get bigger and start to puff out—it might even feel like there is a little lump on your chest. These are called breast buds. This can happen on both sides at the same time, or on just one side at first. If it happens on one side, it can take up to 6 months for the other side to catch up. 

Most people first get their first period 2–3 years after their breast begin to grow. If your breast buds start to grow around age eight or nine, it may take closer to three years for your period to start. If your breast buds develop later than most people in your class, like when you’re 13, it may take less than a year for your period to start.  

Pubic hair
After breast buds, you may notice the first signs of pubic hair. Just a few long hairs may sprout up at first. You’ll grow more pubic hair with time, and that hair will get curlier, thicker, and spread out towards you thighs. 

There is a chance you’ll see some pubic hair before your breasts start to grow, but most people see it the other way around.

You probably won’t see any hair under your arms until around the time your period begins, or just before that
The shape and height of your body will also be changing around this time. By the time you notice breast buds, your whole body will have already started growing more quickly. 

Body shape: Your body’s shape and size also change quickly before your period starts. Your biggest growth spurt may be about six months to a year before your first period (this is the case for most people, but for others, it can be just before, two years before, or even after a first period). If you’re tracking your height, and you notice it changes fast and then starts to slow, your first period may be on its way.

Along with changes to your height and weight, it’s also normal for the size of your pants to get bigger as your hips widen. Some parts of your body will become fattier and rounder, while other parts stay the same. You might notice this begin around the same time your breast buds start to grow. 

The whole lower area of your abdomen is called your pelvis. Your vagina, uterus and ovaries are in there, and also grow in size. The exact timing of your body’s growth will be unique to you.

Vaginal/cervical fluid: Sometime after your breasts start to grow, you may notice a change to the fluid in your vagina, and it may feel a bit wetter than before. Some people will notice this about 6–12 months before a first period. It will likely be a thin, whitish liquid, and won’t have much of a smell. 

As you get close to your first period, you may be able to notice the fluid from your vagina changing day-to-day. Even if you haven’t had a period yet, this is the beginning of your menstrual cycle, which is way more than just your period.",1
How does my hair change during periods ,"Many of the changes you may be associating with your hair throughout your cycle are due to the changes in oil production from your sebaceous glands. Since sebum (oil produced by the sebaceous gland) and the hair follicle exit from the same opening in the skin, the hair and skin surrounding may be coated in sebum. One study had an interesting finding: even if more bad hair days were registered around the time of menstruation, they did not correlate with increases in scalp sebum levels. There was not a clear explanation for the bad hair days—perhaps it’s due to a difference in participants’ personal perception of their hair. Is the change on your head or in your head? Interesting right?

Some hormonal contraceptive medications (like chlormadinone acetate, a synthetic progesterone which provides anti-androgen activity) may also affect hair and skin quality. In one study of people taking these medications, participants had decreased sebum production and improved perceived hair quality.

Sebum production is influenced by your hormones, particularly androgens (like testosterone). Sebum production often ramps up greatly during puberty, often being produced at high amounts between the ages of 15 to 35, as assessed on the skin. Estrogen also influences sebum production, especially at high doses. ",1
Can I prevent premenstrual bloating and period diarrhea,"There isn’t a lot of research on how to treat the specific type of stomach complaints that accompany menstruation. As a rule of thumb, when you have diarrhea, it’s good to drink a lot of liquids to replace the ones you lose through your stool. Drinking and eating salt might help, so you can try soups, plain crackers, or sports drinks. Avoid dairy products, soda, and juice, along with anything that normally upsets your stomach. If your period diarrhea or other gastrointestinal changes last for longer than a couple of days, check in with your healthcare provider.

If you struggle with monthly digestive issues around the time of your period, one option is to talk to your healthcare provider about starting a form of contraception that can help you skip your periods, like oral contraceptive pills",1
Why am I getting a diarrhea during my periods,"When your body releases these prostaglandins (pro-inflammatory chemical-messengers), stimulating your uterus to contract, your endometrial lining is released from your uterus. These prostaglandins, combined with a sharp drop in the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone, are believed to be responsible for gastrointestinal changes prior to and during menstruation. This is believed to be because prostaglandins may also act on the nearby intestinal tissue, causing inflammation.

Not everyone may notice this shift in stool patterns. One study found that around 50% of people with IBS or other bowel disorders experience a change in bowel habits around the time of their period. In comparison, only a third of women without bowel disorders experienced a bowel change related to menstruation. This means that not everybody experiences diarrhea or other gastrointestinal discomfort during their periods. If a person already lives with bowel discomforts, they may be more likely to have changes in bowel habits around menstruation",1
What is causing my Heavy Menstrual Bleeding,"There are a variety of conditions that can cause HMB. The most common conditions include:

Polyps, or growths in the uterine lining, usually cause spotting or bleeding between periods and sometimes HMB.
Adenomyosis, the abnormal growth of uterine lining (endometrium) into the muscular wall of uterus, but can sometimes cause heavy and/or painful periods.
Uterine fibroids, benign growths (smooth muscle tumors) on the uterus, also known as leiomyomas, can sometimes cause HMB. If they grow in the uterine lining (endometrium) they will most likely cause HMB.
Cancers and precancers are very uncommon, but important, causes of abnormal bleeding, particularly for individuals under the age of 40. While they can cause HMB, cancers and precancers more likely cause irregular bleeding or bleeding between periods.
Coagulopathy, an inherited disorder preventing the blood from clotting normally, will cause HMB usually from menarche (the first period).
Ovulatory disorder, the absence or irregularity of ovulation, is a hormonal problem that may cause irregular bleeding that may or may not include HMB as a symptom.
Endometrial disorder, an abnormality in the lining of the uterus, prevents the tissues from stopping the bleeding normally.",1
But I don't know how to identify them and I am scared.,"Any of the following can help you identify heavy periods:

Your menstrual period lasts longer than seven days.
Your flow soaks through tampons or pads every hour for a few hours in a row.
You need to change pads or tampons during the night.
You have multiple grape-sized (or larger) blood clots.
Your heavy menstrual flow keeps you from doing things you would normally do.
You are tired, have a lack of energy or are short of breath.
You feel heavy pain in your abdomen and lower back.
",1
"What should I do for heavy periods, it is very uncomfortable","To treat HMB (heavy menstrual bleeding), you and your healthcare provider need to determine its cause or causes. This can be done by a few simple tests including a blood test, a transvaginal ultrasound and/or taking a sample tissue from the uterine lining (endometrial biopsy).

Polyps: Surgical removal of the polyp is the most effective therapy.
Adenomyosis: Treatment with hormonal contraception, especially an intrauterine device that releases a hormone called progestin.
Fibroids: Some medical or hormonal therapies are effective, although procedures involving surgery are often necessary.
Cancer or pre-cancer: Most pre-cancers can be treated with medication, but cancers usually require surgery.
Blood clotting disorder: Tranexamic acid or hormonal medications are the usual treatment strategy.
Ovulatory disorders: Ovulatory disorders can generally be treated with hormonal medication such as progestins or other hormonal contraceptive medications.
Endometrial disorders: People with endometrial disorders can respond well to tranexamic acid, use of simple NSAIDs like ibuprofen, naproxen or mefenamic acid, the progestin-releasing intrauterine system or other types of hormonal contraception. When a copper intrauterine device is the cause, some of the treatments for endometrial disorders can be effective.
Iron deficiency: Whenever there is an iron deficiency, and especially if there is anemia, an iron replacement should be part of the treatment.
Surgery can be important especially for removal of polyps or fibroids since it can be performed simply and in a way that preserves fertility. Finally, invasive surgery (such as endometrial ablation and hysterectomy) is the last resort to help with the HMB, but is always carefully considered as these procedures can remove your chances to bear children.",1
What does the color of your period blood mean?,"Blood (and tissue) changes color depending on how long it has been exposed to air oxygenation. Think of when you cut your skin—red blood comes out of a fresh wound. If you put a bandage on it and check it the next day, you’ll see that once-red blood will have turned brown. The majority of the water in the blood will have evaporated, making a more concentrated pigmentation.

Your endometrium is the inner lining of your uterus, which is where a fertilized egg would implant and grow. The endometrium is made up of highly vascularized tissue with special spiralized arteries. This provides a fertilized egg with quick and easy access to a fresh blood supply (carrying nutrients and oxygen), so it can start to develop. Right before you get your period, these specialized spiral arteries constrict, to limit blood loss. After the constriction of the spiral arteries, the endometrium starts to break away in pieces from the deeper layers of the uterus. Your endometrium does not separate all at once, it’s a slower, controlled separation, and it takes time for your endometrial tissue to make its way down through your cervix and vagina. This initial blood and tissue may appear dark red or brown, or even black because it takes longer to exit your body.

As tissue breaks away, it leaves torn ends of blood vessels that continue to bleed. This is where the bright red blood you may see during your period comes from. Eventually, platelets (pieces of cells involved in blood clotting) are activated to group together and form a plug to stop the bleeding, bringing the period to an end.

As bleeding slows toward the end of a period, it may once again appear darker red or brown.",1
"I noticed different colours of blood throughout my period, do they have any significance","At the beginning or end of your period, blood can be a dark brown/red shade and can have a thick consistency—but it’s also normal for the first signs of your period to be bright red and more liquid.

If you notice brown period blood at the start or end of your period, it’s because the blood is older and took longer to leave your uterus. The uterine lining darkens the longer it takes to leave the body.

Period blood clots are normal on the heaviest days of your period and can appear deep red or almost dark black as well.",1
What does it mean if my period blood is bright red?,"Period flow typically becomes heavier on the second or third day of the cycle as the uterine lining sheds faster. Bright red period blood is newer blood, thus it doesn’t have time to darken before it exits your body.",1
What does it mean if my period blood is pink?,"Spotting is any bleeding that happens outside of your regular period. Some people experience spotting mid-cycle, also known as ovulation bleeding. Bleeding that mixes with fertile cervical fluid can appear light red or pinkish.

Watery, pink vaginal discharge that occurs irregularly (without a pattern and not related to your menstrual cycle) may be a sign of cervical cancer and should be evaluated by a healthcare provider ",1
What does it mean if my period blood is gray?,"If you have grayish discharge, this could be a sign of an infection. If you experience heavy bleeding with pieces of grayish tissue, this could be a sign of a miscarriage. Seeing a healthcare provider is recommended for either situation.",1
"What is the difference between my period, spotting, and bleeding?","The lines between menstrual bleeding (i.e. your period), spotting, and non-menstrual bleeding can get kind of confusing. Menstrual bleeding is bleeding that is associated with the shedding of the endometrium at the end of the menstrual cycle. Spotting has different definitions, depending on who you ask.",1
what is spotting?,"Researchers and healthcare providers often describe spotting as bleeding that doesn’t require sanitary protection (e.g. you don’t need to use a pad or tampon).

However, this is kind of an arbitrary definition. Even if bleeding isn’t heavy, some people may just choose to use protection anyway.

In theory, spotting can happen at any time during your cycle, so around the period or between periods. Bleeding that doesn’t seem to be associated with the period, such as bleeding during the middle of your cycle, that requires sanitary protection is called non-menstrual bleeding. Sometimes people describe this bleeding as heavy spotting.",1
How does spotting differ from light period bleeding?,"Sometimes people describe light bleeding that occurs at the beginning or end of their period as spotting.

It can be hard to differentiate spotting from menstrual bleeding by just looking at the amount. Generally, if you have light bleeding that occurs within two days of your period, you should consider that part of your period, not spotting. However, if it’s very, very light—like you only see a little on your toilet paper—that probably could be considered spotting.

For example, if you have light bleeding on Sunday, no bleeding on Monday, and bleed enough to require a tampon on Tuesday, you should consider Sunday the start of your period.",1
Do I need to worry if I am spotting between my periods,"Spotting can come from your upper reproductive tract (like your uterus) or your lower reproductive tract (like your cervix or vagina). Spotting is different from your period, which is the cyclical shedding of your uterine lining, your endometrium. Heavier spotting is most often from the uterus, while lighter spotting can come from the upper or lower tract.",1
What are Common causes of spotting,"There are several reasons why you might be spotting:

1. Hormonal contraception and spotting
Spotting is a common side effect of hormonal contraception, especially during the first few months of starting a new method. 

2. Pregnancy and spotting
Spotting is also a common symptom of early pregnancy. About 1 in 4 people experience spotting, usually between gestational weeks 5 and 8 (or about 1 to 4 weeks after someone expects their period).If you are worried about having a miscarriage, then worry not —research has shown that people with spotting aren’t more likely to have a miscarriage than people who don’t have spotting. However, heavy spotting or bleeding may be more of a concern. If you’re pregnant and bleeding, call your healthcare provider to let them know what’s going on. While many sources call spotting in early pregnancy “implantation bleeding,” there isn’t strong evidence that it’s associated with an embryo’s implantation in the uterus. It may actually be related to hormonal changes, as the production of progesterone switches from the ovary to the forming placenta.

Spotting can be a symptom of an ectopic pregnancy. This is a pregnancy that is growing somewhere other than the uterus, usually the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancy bleeding may be coupled with other symptoms including abdominal pain on one side, shoulder pain, and/or dizziness. If you experience symptoms of spotting and suspect you may have an ectopic pregnancy, seek immediate medical help.

3. Ovulation, hormonal issues, and spotting
Spotting can also occur around the time of ovulation. It’s unclear why some people experience ovulation bleeding while others don’t—some research suggests it happens in people who have higher levels of some hormones.",1
Is there any link between physical conditions or infections and spotting?,"Physical conditions, infections, and spotting Spotting can also be caused by infections and physical changes in the reproductive tract, or hormonal imbalances. Physical conditions that can cause spotting episodes include fibroids (abnormal growth of muscle tissue on your uterus), uterine or cervical polyps (abnormal growths on your cervix or the inside of your uterus) and endometriosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which happens when certain pelvic infections (like STIs) go untreated, can also be another culprit for unscheduled spotting. Other symptoms of PID can include pain in the lower abdomen, unusual vaginal discharge, and fever. If you suspect you have spotting and other associated symptoms of PID or of physical pelvic conditions, it’s important to discuss this with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can cause bleeding from the urethra (where you pee from, between your clitoris and vagina). Pain while urinating, paired with a small amount of blood on the toilet paper, might be signs of a UTI. Consistently spotting after penetrative vaginal intercourse is not considered normal. Bleeding after sex (postcoital spotting) is often caused by an issue with the cervix or polyps. Some people may experience spotting after their first intercourse experience, which is normal. If you’re noticing spotting after sex, talk to your healthcare provider. If you’re taking combined oral contraceptives (the most common type of birth control pill), you may have spotting that goes away after a couple of months. If spotting between withdrawal bleeding continues, your pill may not be the best fit for you, and you may want to try another brand with a different chemical formulation. Spotting might also happen if you forget to take your pills and the levels of the pill’s hormones drop in your body. Spotting is common and often unpredictable with the hormonal IUD, the contraceptive implant, the contraceptive shot (injection, and the mini-pill (a progestin-only pill).",
how do you know when ovulation is happening?,"As ovulation approaches, your body produces more cervical fluid. You can see this fluid in your underwear or on toilet paper when you use the bathroom. It becomes stretchier, clearer, and more wet and slippery—like a raw egg white. This fluid tends to “peak” about 1 to 2 days before ovulation, when estrogen is highest. A surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) occurs and triggers the egg to be released from the follicle 36 to 40 hours after the spike in estrogen. Some people feel ovulation pain or “mittelschmerz”—a sharp or cramp-like pain felt on either side of the lower abdomen, that can last a few hours or days.

Tracking your basal body temperature (BBT) can also allow you to detect ovulation — as progesterone rises to prepare the uterus for implantation of a fertilized , it causes a slight increase in your BBT. You can also use ovulation prediction tests/kits (OPKs).",1
I do't have any idea about what uterine fibroid is,"Uterine fibroids are abnormal growths of muscle tissue that form in (or on) the walls of the uterus. Fibroids are benign (not harmful/life threatening), but can cause symptoms such as irregular vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. Uterine fibroids are sometimes called myomas or leiomyomas in medical literature.

Uterine fibroids are very common. About 3 in 4 women may have them at some point in their lives. They are most common during the reproductive years, and are more likely to occur in people of African ancestry. Uterine fibroids most often cause no symptoms at all and often shrink after menopause. In other cases, untreated fibroids may lead to problems such as heavy bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain or pressure, fertility changes, and complications during pregnancy. Symptoms depend on the size, location, and number of fibroids.",1
What are its symptoms,"Some of the most common symptoms of uterine fibroids are:

Periods that are heavy, long, and/or painful
Irregular bleeding 
Pelvic pressure or pain 
Frequent urination and difficulty emptying the bladder
Constipation 
Difficulty getting pregnant or carrying to term
In rare cases, uterine fibroids can become very large, twisted, or infected. These situations can create intense symptoms, and may require immediate medical treatment.

Some studies show that pregnancy may cause fibroids to grow slightly bigger in up to 1 in 3 people. This might make some symptoms more noticeable. The most common complication of uterine fibroids in pregnancy is pain, usually felt in the second and third trimesters",1
Why uterine fibroids happen,"Uterine fibroids occur when muscle cells in the uterus multiply too many times. As cells multiply, lumps of various shapes and sizes are formed. They can be numerous or few—some people might only have one. These lumps can grow on the inner and outer surfaces of the uterus, as well as within the uterine wall.

Research shows the hormones estrogen and progesterone play a role in the growth of uterine fibroids. This is probably why fibroids tend to shrink after menopause, when production of these hormones decreases.

Some people are more likely than others to develop uterine fibroids, and in fact fibroids may be inherited genetically. This means someone is more likely to develop fibroids if a family member has had them. People of African ancestry are significantly more likely to develop them. If you have hypertension or polycystic ovary syndrome, then you are more likely to have uterine fibroids. They are more common in people who have an earlier age at first menstruation (menarche), and people who have not given birth, though this may be because women with fibroids may have difficulty conceiving. Maintaining a diet high in red meat consumption may also increase the risk of uterine fibroids, as may beer consumption.

There are different types of fibroids which can create different symptoms. Fibroids embedded within the uterine wall (intramural fibroids) can change the shape of the uterus, which may cause changes in fertility. Fibroids that project into the inside of the uterus (submucosal fibroids) may also cause difficulty in becoming or staying pregnant",1
Why do you need to get checked for uterine fibroids,"Uterine fibroids are generally harmless and often go away on their own. When symptoms occur, however, untreated fibroids can interfere with a person’s quality of life and may lead to complications such as anemia. Anemia is a condition when the body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells to function properly. This can happen when uterine fibroids cause heavy bleeding.

Some uterine fibroids may also interfere with the probability of becoming pregnant, and may increase the chance of miscarriage, but more research is needed here. In these cases, treatment can help people become and stay pregnant.

Rarely, uterine fibroids can become very large, twisted, or infected. These situations can create symptoms that are intense, and may require immediate medical treatment, hence it is important to get them checked.",1
How are uterine fibroids diagnosed,"A healthcare provider will probably ask questions about your symptoms, medical, and menstrual history. Some uterine fibroids are diagnosed with a physical exam. Other diagnostic methods may include a pelvic ultrasound (sonogram), an MRI or a sonohysterogram (an ultrasound performed after the uterus is filled with fluid)",1
What can I do about uterine fibroids,"You and your healthcare provider may choose to leave fibroids with mild symptoms untreated. Tracking your symptoms can then help you know if your fibroids are changing, and at what point a treatment plan might be helpful. When fibroids do become problematic, there are many different options for managing and treating them, and for preventing their future formation:

Medications
In some cases, hormonal medications are prescribed to treat uterine fibroids. These include Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulators (SPRM) which change the effect of progesterone in the body, and Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Agonists which block the body’s production of both progesterone and estrogen. These medications have been shown to lessen the size and number of uterine fibroids over time in people of reproductive age.

Lifestyle Changes
Maintaining a healthy weight may help lessen the occurrence uterine fibroids. Getting enough exercise and eating a balanced diet may also help with this. Specifically, a diet low in red meat and high in green vegetables may help to lessen the prevalence and severity of fibroids in some people.

Non-surgical procedures
Some symptomatic uterine fibroids may be destroyed through non-invasive procedures like uterine artery embolization and radiofrequency myolysis. These procedures cut off blood supply to fibroids. MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) is an example of a newer technique that uses soundwaves to destroy fibroids.

Surgery
Uterine fibroids are sometimes treated with minimally invasive surgical procedures, via the abdomen or pelvis. Some cases of fibroids may be treated with a procedure called an abdominal myomectomy, in which problematic fibroids are surgically removed. In severe cases, a hysterectomy, or a removal of the uterus, may be performed",1
I  might have underactive thyroid. Can that cause heacy periods?,"There are several mechanisms by which an underactive thyroid can make periods heavier:

Without sufficient thyroid hormone, your ovaries may not be able to make enough of the flow-decreasing hormone progesterone.
Without sufficient thyroid hormone, you may not make enough of the coagulation factors you need to prevent heavy bleeding.
Without sufficient thyroid hormone, you make less of the estrogen-binding protein SHBG and so are exposed to more estrogen.
If your healthcare provider discovers that you have an underactive thyroid, then your best treatment for heavy periods may be to take thyroid hormone",1
Our village ladies used to share natural rememdies for everything. Are there any for PCOS,"PCOS is made worse by high blood sugar and insulin, so one of the best treatments is to stop eating sugary foods such as dessert, fruit juice and sweetened yogurt. The nutritional supplements magnesium, berberine and inositol can help to regulate blood sugar and may relieve symptoms of PCOS.",1
Can you please explain what exactly is Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA),"Amenorrhea is the Latin word for lack of periods. Hypothalamic amenorrhea simply means lack of periods because of your hypothalamus (your brain’s hormone command center). It’s not that anything is wrong with your hypothalamus, exactly. It has simply stopped producing a hormone required for menstruation (GnRH). This can happen in response to things like emotional stress, or not eating enough",1
What are natural remedies for FHA (Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea),"Convince your hypothalamus that all is well and it’s okay to have periods again. To do that, you might need to reduce stress and/or gain some body fat. The herbal medicine ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) helps to regulate the body’s stress response, and so can be helpful for hypothalamic amenorrhea.",1
What is the Naturopathic Treatment for heavy periods,"You can promote the normal detoxification of estrogen by maintaining healthy intestinal bacteria. Bacteria benefit from vegetables, probiotics, and from avoiding the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Another way to reduce estrogen is to take a phytonutrient derived from broccoli called DIM (diindolylmethane)",1
Are there any natural remedies for painful periods,"Yes, there are! Standard period pain responds well to natural supplements such as zinc, turmeric and magnesium. Supplements work gently and gradually, so they must be taken every day throughout the month — not just during your period.",1
Are there any natural remedies for PMS?,"Yes, there are! PMS responds very well to magnesium. In some people, magnesium deficiency may actually be the main cause of PMS. PMS also responds well to the herbal medicine* Vitex agnus-castus",1
Does stress play a part in how my reproductive system works biologically?,"Yes, it does! Stress activates a hormonal pathway in the body called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Activation of the HPA axis is associated with increased levels of cortisol and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The HPA axis, cortisol, and CRH help control stress response in the body. CRH and cortisol release can suppress normal levels of reproductive hormones, potentially leading to abnormal ovulation, anovulation (i.e. no ovulation), or amenorrhea (i.e. absence of menstruation). Furthermore, abnormal levels of CRH in reproductive tissue have been associated with negative pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth",1
 Can my daily life stresses affect how long I get my period?,"There is a possibility that daily life stress affects the length of your cycle. One study of stress in female nurses found associations between high stress and both anovulation and longer cycles, though these findings may be in part due to rotating shift work (working nights), which is common for nurses. Conversely, high stress jobs have also been associated with shorter cycles. 

These studies may have found different results because the stress of study participants may not have been equal. Differences in the level and length of stress exposure could cause people’s bodies to respond in different ways. For example, in one study, perimenopausal (approaching menopause) people with high stress were no more likely to have altered cycles than low stress people after one year; however, high stress was linked to shorter menstrual cycles after two years, indicating that symptoms may not present immediately.",1
I have a very stressful life. Does that affect my period pain?,"In short, yes! Dysmenorrhea (i.e. painful menstruation) has been linked to working in jobs that are low control, are unsecure and have low coworker support. Stress from the preceding month may also affect the frequency of dysmenorrhea, so someone might not experience painful menstruation as a result of stress until their period the following month. Similarly, people experiencing stress earlier in their cycle were more likely to report severe symptoms during the time leading up to and during menstruation.

As mentioned, the different effects of stress may be, in part, due to timing. Higher reported stress during the follicular phase (i.e. from the first day of menstruation until ovulation) has been strongly associated with changes in normal reproductive function. In one recent study, those reporting pre-ovulatory stress (during the follicular phase) were less likely to become pregnant as compared to those not reporting stress during the same time. This suggests that stress may cause the body to delay or entirely suppress ovulation. This idea is supported by research examining menstrual cycle variation.

The length of the luteal phase (i.e. post-ovulation until menstruation) tends to be consistent across and within women, whereas the length of the follicular phase has a stronger association with the variation in the total length of the entire menstrual cycle. This means that the follicular phase, as opposed to the luteal phase, is more likely to change in length. Therefore, the effects of stress on ovulation may be one of the biggest factors related to changes in cycle length due to stress, though it is unclear how this would be related to other stress-related changes in the menstrual cycle, such as painful menstruation.",1
What to do if I get my periods at school,"1. Know that it’s OK—this has happened to most people who menstruate.
If you do get an unexpected period at school and are not prepared, there is no need to panic. You are not the first and definitely not the last in this situation.

What’s important now is to make you feel comfortable with the situation. A big part of that is making sure your blood is collected in a way that makes you feel comfortable—that means getting some supplies.

2. Get supplies that you feel comfortable using.
Schools usually stock their menstrual products in two places: the girls’ bathrooms (either in free-for-all baskets or in small change vending machines) and the nurse’s office. (Some schools may not have a nurse’s office or health office.)

If you are in class, ask to be excused to the bathroom or the nurse’s office. Ask a friend who menstruates if they have an extra pad or tampon you could borrow. If they don’t, grab some small change just in case you need to use a vending machine to purchase supplies. If your teacher asks what’s happening and you don’t feel comfortable discussing your period in front of others (no need to feel bad about your body doing its thing, but it’s a subject that may take getting used to!), “stomach problems” are a good go-to.

Some schools allow students who have their period or are experiencing bad cramps to skip PE / PT classes or to work out at their own pace instead of joining the rest of the group. Find out if that is the case for your school and whom you should inform if you would need to be excused from working out on a given day.
",1
How can I prepare myself if I get my periods in school,"Before your next period comes, stock up on whatever collection methods you use and make sure you have a few spare pads or tampons in each backpack and purse that you take with you most often. If you use non-disposables like period panties, or washable cotton pads to manage your bleeding, remember to also bring a resealable bag or container you can store used ones in with you in case you would need to change them during the day. An extra precaution against ruining your day’s choice of bottoms is to keep a spare pair of underwear stashed away in your backpack too.",
What should I do if my classmate gets their period,"Be kind and helpful to friends and classmates who end up in a similar predicament. Offer a tampon or pad and help normalize periods and menstrual health in your group of friends.

If you see blood on someone else’s pants or skirt, let them know discretely about the situation. If it is their first period, take them to the nurse or bathroom and lend them some period supplies if needed. You are in this together, so look out for each other!",
What to do if I see stains on my clothes,"If you notice period stains on your clothing, pre-wash them with cold water and soap as soon as you can—either still in school or once you get home for the day. Blood is a hard substance to clean off many textiles after it dries, so quick action gives you better chances of getting the stain out completely. However, if a garment remains stained, don’t worry about it too much. Many people have a few pairs of battle-worn “period panties.” These undergarments may be dotted with lighter spots from discharge or dark splatters of blood that just aren’t going away, but they are comfortable and a perfect choice for heavier flow days or days when you expect that your period may start.",
What should I use to collect my blood?,"There are plenty of collection methods you can use. The two you are most likely to encounter are pads and tampons. Pads are the simplest to use and are most often available in school nurses’ offices—all you need to do is place one with the sticky side on your underwear and you’re good to go. Tampons are also frequently available. There is a bit of a learning curve involved with tampons, because they need to be inserted into your vagina. But many people prefer them, so if you feel comfortable, you can give them a shot. Regardless of which type of period product you decide to go with, a friend, the school nurse, or your parent will be able to demonstrate how to use it correctly.",
Do I have a vagina?,If you are confirmed as a female by birth then you do have a vagina.,
Is my vagina and vulva the same thing?,"That is a nice question, a lot of people don't know that vulva and vagin are two different parts. The vulva is the part of your genitals on the outside of your body — your labia, clitoris, vaginal opening, and the opening to the urethra (the hole you pee out of). While vaginas are just one part of the vulva, many people say “vagina” when they really mean the vulva. But the vulva has a lot more going on than just the vagina.",
What is a vagina?,"The vagina is the tube between the vulva and the cervix. This tube is the connection between your uterus and the outside world. The vagina is what babies exit through during birth, and what menstrual blood exits through during your period. The vagina is also used for insertion, such as with a penis, fingers, female condoms, sex toys, tampons, or menstrual cups.

The vagina can also act as a route to other parts of the body. During penis-vagina sex, ejaculate is deposited in the vagina, allowing sperm to enter the uterus through the cervix. The walls of the vagina can also be used as an administrative route for medications and contraceptives, such as intervaginal hormone creams, the hormonal vaginal contraceptive ring, or vaginal suppository medications.",1
Does my vagina change with age?,"Yes, it does. The vagina can change a lot throughout a person's life. An average adult vagina is slightly curved, and can range between 7 to 12 cm in length — but every body is different, and there’s no such thing as a too small or too large vagina.

The vagina is strongly influenced by hormonal changes throughout the body. During the reproductive years after menarche (the first menstrual period) and before menopause, more layers of tissue are present lining the vagina, due to stimulation from higher estrogen levels in the body.

After menopause, when estrogen is lower, the walls of the vagina become thinner and frailer, which can cause symptoms of vaginal dryness and decreased vaginal secretions. This may result in discomfort during sex and increase the chances of vaginal irritation or infection ",1
Will it change during pregnancy too?,"Yes it will! The vagina is also influenced by changing hormone levels during pregnancy. Increased blood flow is directed to the pelvis, causing a deeper color change to the vulva and vagina. Throughout a pregnancy, the connective tissue of the vaginal walls progressively relaxes, in preparation for the delivery of a baby. After delivery, the vagina and vaginal opening temporarily widen, but 6-12 weeks post-delivery, the vagina returns to its pre-pregnancy size. As people age, the walls of the vagina become more relaxed, and the diameter of the vagina becomes wider. When it comes to sexual satisfaction, vaginal size does not affect sexual function. The perception of vaginal tightness during sex is primarily related to the pelvic floor muscles, which are present around the base of the vagina and not actually how wide the vaginal canal is.",
"During the menstrual cycle, how does my vagina change?","The vagina also changes in response to hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. Around mid-cycle, when estrogen is highest, vaginal tissue becomes thicker and fuller.

The cervix, at the top of the vagina, moves and changes shape throughout the cycle. Before and after the fertile window, the cervix is low and can be felt in the vagina, with a firm texture, and the hole in the center of the cervix is closed. During the fertile window, the hole in the cervix opens to facilitate the entrance of sperm into the uterus, the cervix rises higher in the vagina, and is softer when touched",1
I am curious of how my vagina (private part) changes during sex,"The vagina can undergo more rapid changes, such as during sexual activity. When a person with a vagina is sexually aroused, increased blood flow is directed towards the genitals, causing the vaginal tissue to become engorged with blood, and additional lubrication to be produced. This fluid is called arousal fluid.

During sexual excitement, the vagina expands by lengthening and widening in shape. This is called vaginal tenting and ballooning. This shape change happens as the uterus and cervix are drawn higher into the pelvis, which creates more space and moves the cervix farther away from any semen that is ejaculated into the vagina. This allows time for the semen to mix with female genital fluids, stimulating the sperm to undergo the physical changes necessary for fertilizing an egg (9).

The vagina is an incredible organ which changes in response to hormones, life stages, and physical responses. So show your vagina some love, and feel free to tell anyone you want just how amazing your vagina really is.",1
How to clean my vagina?,"If you want to wash your vagina, you should wash do it with warm water. If you’d like, you can use a mild soap that won’t irritate the skin — but this isn’t necessary. Spread your lips apart and gently cleanse around the folds, using a clean washcloth or your hands. Avoid getting water or soap inside your vagina.

In addition to washing your vulva, it’s a good idea to wash the anus and the area between your vulva and anus every day. It’s best to wash “front to back” — in other words, wash your vulva first and then your anus. Otherwise, bacteria from the anus can spread to your vagina, which can cause infections.",1
Do I ovulate on the contraceptive pill?,"No. If you take your pill consistently and correctly, you shouldn’t ovulate. This is the primary way the pill prevents pregnancy. In a usual (no-pill) cycle, the body’s natural reproductive hormones fluctuate up and down, taking your body through a process of preparing an egg for release, releasing that egg, and preparing your uterus to accept a potentially fertilized egg.

The hormones in the contraceptive pill stop and prevent your ovaries from preparing and releasing eggs. They stop the usual hormonal “cycling”, including ovulation, the typical growth of the endometrium, and the natural period, meaning you ideally should not be ovulating and can't get pregnant if taken correctly.",1
Why is my bleeding different on the contraceptive pill?,"The contraceptive pill prevents the lining of your uterus (your endometrium) from growing thicker, as it would in a typical menstrual cycle. It also prevents ovulation and the typical cycling of reproductive hormones. When you have withdrawal bleeding, the bleeding tends to be lighter than normal menstrual bleeding. The contraceptive pill prevents the lining of your uterus (your endometrium) from growing thicker, as it would in a typical menstrual cycle. It also prevents ovulation and the typical cycling of reproductive hormones. When you have withdrawal bleeding, the bleeding tends to be lighter than normal menstrual bleeding.",1
Can I get my periods early,"Yes, that is possible. If your period comes early once in a while, it is likely normal and not a cause for concern. Menstruation might start early because of a change in your lifestyle, intense physical exercise, illness, or stress. However, sometimes it happens with no reason, and this is still not necessarily abnormal. So, if you get your period a week early, try not to worry. If your period is consistently irregular, you can let your health care provider know to rule out any problems.",1
Why did I get my periods early,"Some possible causes of getting your period early: 

Hormonal imbalance 
Medical conditions
Taking certain medications 
Perimenopause
Over-exercising
Poor nutrition
Stress
Sudden weight gain or loss 
Your birth control method can also affect your cycle. An emergency contraceptive pill can cause an early period. If you skip a few combined oral contraceptive pills, your hormone levels may drop, and bleeding may start before it’s due.",1
"A lot of people get period clots, is that normal?","Throughout your period, you will bleed about 2-3 tablespoons (35-45 ml) of blood. This includes the uterine lining, which is made of cells similar to skin cells, blood vessels, and glands. Every period is unique and each varies in frequency, heaviness, color, and texture. Clots or clumps on the heaviest days of a period may be typical for some people. Period blood clots can appear like clumps or chunks of blood, and/or a jelly-like consistency and can vary in size and number.",1
Will I get menopause? ,"Menopause is when someone’s menstrual cycles come to an end, and pregnancy is no longer possible. The word menopause is from the Greek root word men, meaning “month” and pausis meaning pause or cessation.

Menopause is a unique experience— did you know humans are 1 of only 4 species on the planet who experience it. For some people, it’s both an ending and a beginning. It can bring a lot of new changes, and for some people it might not feel like much of a change at all.

Menopause is a normal life phase, but can also be induced by surgery, drug treatments, or medication. It technically begins after your last menstrual period, but your healthcare provider will consider you to have reached menopause after 12 months without a period",1
What is perimenopause?,"Perimenopause is the body’s transition into menopause (fun fact: peri comes from the Greek word for “around”). You may not have heard the term before, because people often confuse perimenopause (the transition period) with menopause (the time after your last period). But guess what? They're actually 2 different phases!  

Perimenopause can be as short as a few months or last up to 8 years. On average, it lasts around 4–5 years. During perimenopause, hormone levels fluctuate and then decline, giving rise to new sensations, symptoms, and changes. These experiences of perimenopause vary widely across people and cultures, your dadi might have had different experiences then my dadi due to all the various reasons.",1
Why is it important for me to know about menopause and perimenopause,"Every woman and person with a cycle who goes through the natural aging process will experience these life stages. Despite this, they are still underrepresented in culture and research.

Knowing what changes are possible can help you identify the transition in yourself. Also, because it’s still possible to have or develop reproductive conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or endometriosis during perimenopause, it’s important to know what the probable signs of perimenopause are, and what symptoms might be signs of something else. No harm in being ready for what is to come right?",1
When will my perimenopause start? What is the average age of menopause?,"The exact start of perimenopause—the transition into menopause—is hard to pinpoint. One study that tracked women as they transitioned into menopause found that menstrual irregularity began on average between ages 47 and 48. But it can begin much earlier or later. In that same study, of those who were still menstruating at age 45, about 1 in 3 reported menstrual irregularity. At age 52, about 1 in 10 reported that they were still menstruating normally. There are other perimenopausal changes and symptoms that may be felt before menstrual irregularity begins, which may help in identifying a different starting point of perimenopause, but more research is needed.

Menopause—when periods actually stop— happens on average at age 51, but most people reach it anywhere between ages 45–55. About 4 in 10 women reach menopause by age 50, 9 in 10 will reach it by age 55.  

Menopause is considered “early” when before age 45, and  “premature” when it happens before age 40. Premature menopause is also sometimes called primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or premature ovarian failure (not the greatest of terms). About 1 in 100 people experience premature menopause for non-surgical or chemotherapy-related reasons. Early menopause can be caused or influenced by cigarette smoking, certain medications,  chemotherapy, and possibly insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (10,11). 

People who have an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) will undergo menopause immediately. Sometimes people who have had a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) will also experience early menopause, even if their ovaries are not removed. People who have had menopause induced due to surgery, drug treatments, or medication generally do not experience perimenopause, since there is an abrupt stop to their reproductive function. But people with induced menopause may still experience symptoms of menopause.",1
How long does menopause last? (How long does perimenopause last?),"You might ask: how long does menopause last? Perimenopause is the transition period, and menopause is the time after your last period. 

The menstrual cycle irregularities of perimenopause last an average of about 4 years, from the beginning of menstrual irregularity to the last period. But it can last anywhere from a few months to ~8 years. About 1 in 10 people may experience the transition more abruptly, with only a few months of menstrual irregularity. These people also tend to report fewer symptoms like hot flashes",1
What can affect the age of menopause?,"Smoking: yes.

Hormonal birth control: maybe. 

Your genetics, environment, and lifestyle may all play a role in how you experience perimenopause, and the timing of perimenopause and menopause. People who reach menopause later in life tend to have shorter transitions. Smokers tend to be slightly younger at perimenopause and have shorter transitions, reaching menopause about a year earlier than average. There are likely other differences due to ethnic background and/or related environmental and behavioral factors, such as living in a village or living in an urban city but more research is needed on this topic.

A person’s pregnancy history and their history of oral contraceptives (OCs) use might delay menopause. Studies on the topic are mixed—some studies have found an association, and others not—and the biological reason why this would be the case (if true) is not fully understood (5,10,13). Although being pregnant and using OCs suppresses ovulation, they don’t suppress the development (and death) of eggs prior to the point of ovulation, so why using OCs would impact timing of menopause is still unclear.",1
What will my common changes and symptoms be in my perimenopause,"Here are some symptoms you might experience:
Hot flashes (aka hot flushes) 
Sweating 
Disturbed sleep 
Changes in mood and anxiety 
Migraines 
Increased forgetfulness 
Changes in sexual desire 
Vaginal dryness and itchiness
Lowered fertility/infertility
Increased abdominal body fat. 
Lasting physical changes to be aware of include loss of bone density, vaginal dryness, changes in urination function, and changes in sexual function. 

Fortunately, the end of menstrual cycles also means the end of any negative symptoms you may have experienced during your cycle, like cramps, as well as the risk of unintended pregnancy.",1
How will my menstrual cycle changes before and during perimenopause,"1. At first, you may notice that your period arrives slightly earlier each cycle (ie shorter menstrual cycles) and is heavier.

As you approach perimenopause, your hormone levels begin to change. This happens before your periods become unpredictable. For some people, one of the earliest signs of perimenopause is that their periods arrive slightly earlier—meaning that their menstrual cycle shortens, by ~2–4 days This is due to a shortening of the follicular phase (the first part of the menstrual cycle), as ovulation happens more quickly. During perimenopause, less estrogen is produced. But before perimenopause, estrogen levels can actually rise for a while, and progesterone levels typically decrease . This is what shortens the follicular phase, and may also cause other changes, symptoms, or sensations. You may notice changes to the heaviness of your period during this time. Lower progesterone—with or without higher estrogen—may also lead to heavier periods, which is more common in early perimenopause.

2. Later, you may have irregular cycles and bleeding changes. 

As the number of follicles in your ovaries decreases, ovulation becomes less common, and hormone levels start to fluctuate more and more. Menstrual cycles might become longer, and then progressively more variable—longer and shorter, with menstrual periods that are heavier, lighter, and far less predictable . 

The heaviness of your period will also fluctuate. Cycles without ovulation may have lighter periods, while periods that come after a long cycle may be long. On average, about 6 of the final 10 cycles before menopause are prolonged and anovulatory (where ovulation doesn’t occur). In the 1-2 years before menopause, it’s common for cycles to last more than 5 weeks. 

3. Eventually, no period it is.

As ovulation becomes rare, your period might go away for months at a time, and then return. This phase lasts between 1-3 years for most people, but again, everyone is different (6). Eventually, menopause is reached, and cycles comes to an end, along with the period.

About 1 in 10 people may stop menstruating more abruptly, with much less prolonged irregularity.",1
How can I manage symptoms of menopause and perimenopause?,"Quick reminder: perimenopause is the transition period before menopause. It is a normal function of the body, but some of the changes it causes can feel uncomfortable, or even rageful. 

If you are experiencing symptoms that affect your quality of life, such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, changes in mood, or difficulty sleeping, seeing a healthcare provider or a perimenopause specialist can be a good idea. ",1
When should I see a healthcare provider regarding menopause and perimenopause?,"If you are concerned about the heaviness or length of your period, you experience any spotting or bleeding after reaching full menopause, you experience bleeding during penetrative sex, you experience any spotting or bleeding after reaching full menopause or see abnormal bleeding during perimenopause or after menopause, you should go see a heath provider. If you notice that you bleed between periods, especially if you have a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), are higher weight, have a family history of uterine cancer, or have taken estrogen-only hormone therapy or certain medications to prevent breast cancer, you should definitely meet a health provider.  Of course, if you have any doubts and see anything unusual, you should always get your questions answered by asking an expert, like myself! 

Some more information regarding bleeding in perimenopause and menopause that you should be aware of. Although changes in bleeding are to be expected during perimenopause, some bleeding changes may be caused by abnormal changes to your endometrium (i.e. the lining of your uterus). If the endometrium becomes too thick and irregular, it can develop into cancer, but this can usually be prevented if caught early. Also, In some cases, bleeding continues after menopause. It is easy to mistake this type of bleeding for symptoms of perimenopause, which may mislead someone to think they have not reached full-menopause when they actually have. 

Any spotting or bleeding after menopause is abnormal and should be checked out by a healthcare provider. Spotting or bleeding after menopause can be caused by a medical condition, such as uterine polyps. Uterine polyps are growths on the inside lining of the uterus (the endometrium), and become more common with age",1
I don't know what are uterine polyps. Can you please tell me what are they?,"Have you been noticing irregular vaginal bleeding? This might be because of uterine polyps. Uterine polyps, also called endometrial polyps, are abnormal growths on the inside lining of the uterus (the endometrium). 
Uterine polyps are very common. Up to 3 in 10 people may have them at some point in their lives, but fewer than 1 in 100 people develop polyps before age 30. They occur most commonly leading up to and after menopause, so you might hear your ammas or nanis mentioning they know someone their age who has a uterine polyps. Small polyps may cause no symptoms at all and can go away on their own. In other cases, untreated polyps may cause symptoms that affect quality of life and can carry a small chance of becoming cancerous. They may also affect fertility, but research on this topic is still lacking.

Nearly all symptoms of uterine polyps are easy to track. Finding out early and early treatment can reduce the risk of complications.",1
Why do uterine polyps happen?,"Uterine polyps occur when cells of the uterine lining (the endometrium) multiply too many times. As this happens, lumps are formed. These lumps often resemble hanging sacs or mushrooms made of tissue. Most are very small, but can range in size from a few millimeters, to several centimeters in diameter. Polyps can be numerous or few, and some people might only have one. Some research shows that estrogen plays an important role in the formation of polyps, but it’s not yet clear how.

To give you some more information, some people are more likely than others to develop uterine polyps. They are most common in people who are perimenopausal and postmenopausal. If you are obese, you must also know that obesity also makes people significantly more likely to develop polyps. If you have taken the the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, this can be a contributing factor too.

",1
Are uterine polyps and uterine fibroids similar or different?,"Uterine polyps are similar to a type of uterine fibroids (they form from muscle tissue in the uterus, but can cause many of the same symptoms, as well as other ones).  The biggest difference is that fibroids are more likely to be problematic in the reproductive years and shrink after menopause, while polyps are more likely to be problematic after menopause, so really depends on what phase you are in at the moment. ",
Do I need to get my uterine polyps checked out?,"Small uterine polyps are often asymptomatic, and can come and go on their own. Some untreated polyps, however, may cause symptoms that affect your quality of life and can lead to complications such as anemia (a condition when the body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells to function properly. This can happen when uterine polyps cause a high amount of blood loss).

In rare cases, some uterine polyps carry a small chance of becoming cancerous. They may also affect the ability to get or stay pregnant, but research on this topic is still lacking",1
How will I be diagnosed if I have uterine polyps?,"When you go in for your polyp diagnosis, a healthcare provider will probably ask you questions about symptoms, medical and menstrual history and perform a simple physical exam. If they suspect you have uterine polyps, they may also perform a transvaginal ultrasound, a hysteroscopy (a small camera inserted into the uterus) or a biopsy (a small tool is inserted into the uterus to take a tissue sample)",1
What can I do if I have been diagnosed with uterine polyps?,"Small uterine polyps can go away on their own without treatment. However, if you have an uterine polyp and belive it to be problematic, then there are a few different options treating existing polyps, and for preventing their future formation:

Medications: 
Hormonal medications are sometimes prescribed to treat the symptoms of uterine polyps. These include Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonists, which block the body’s production of certain hormones progesterone, and progesterone, often prescribed in the form of a cream. However, there has been little research on the effectiveness of these hormonal treatments for uterine polyps.

Non-invasive surgery:
Small polyps can be removed with a process called hysteroscopic excision. Research says about 7 in 10 people with small polyps (<1cm) found their symptoms significantly improved after this procedure.

Lifestyle Changes: 
Research on this is still unclear, but weight loss may improve the prognosis of people who are diagnosed with both uterine polyps and obesity",1
Will my son have a vagina like myself,"Alongside uterus and ovaries, men do not have a vagina. Instead, men have a penis (it is the male organ used for urination and sexual intercourse).",1
Do my husband get periods and can he give birth to a child?,"Anyone who has a uterus and ovaries could become pregnant and give birth. Since men do not have either of these, they cannot give birth to a man",1
"My vagina has an odor, is that normal?","Yes, it is absolutely fine to have an odor. No vagina is odorless, nor should they be. Vaginas have many possible smells, from coppery to sweet. The smell of your vagina might change depending on your diet and menstrual cycle.

If the smell is pungent and unpleasant, contact a doctor or other healthcare provider. Certain conditions, such as bacterial vaginosis, can cause your vagina to smell strongly. Your provider can advise you on any next steps.",1
