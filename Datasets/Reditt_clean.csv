"just wait until the vampires learn about this...
(/s)",i....have no words.,this post mostly ,what's the story behind your flair?,no.,"can i post a pic of my  bear teddy art? on sunday, of course!! ;)","pretty much, you just give it a prompt and get a result within a minute or even less. that's why we consider it low effort, not because of our personal views on whether it is legitimate art or not.
not accusing you of anything, just hoping to clarify. <3","they are artificial intelligence that makes art. how i believe it works is you input something you want it to draw (ex. tree) and it scans the internet for images of trees and makes one as art.
it's a pretty contentious thing rn since some people say it isn't even art and it takes away from human artists, etc."
"interesting.
now there is more to learn and to read about because my mind isnt capable of finding peace when i have questions.
if by casuality someone that knows about science, psychology, neurology or anything could come and teach us a few things about this conversation, i would be happy.","personally, i'm not asexual, but not strictly allosexual either (autistic, demisexual etc.). i used to be somewhat repulsed by genitals despite very open upbringing, no religious or moral baggage, no trauma, good education. heck, i grew up pagan with the whole feminist mother nature /phallus worship slant.
exposure in both the  sense and non- (naturist) setting alleviated that, but it's kinda ""schrodinger's neutral"" - i'm simultaneously indifferent, positive (in a theoretical appreciation way) and repulsed. i'm not -repulsed, so that allowed me positive interaction with genitals. a -repulsed asexual doesn't have that option, and even my ""training myself"" didn't fully remove the negative undercurrent. the social construct aspect is salvageable, and that would be sufficient for the majority of people, but the brain wiring isn't.","im not certain about that. i've been working in a naturist camping. people hang out completely . genitals then lose their ""sacred, , hidden, whatever"" character. i strongly believe it is a social construct.
obviously, when things get hot between persons,  get sexy, but when having a coffee, it doesnt.
where does repulsion come from ? isnt it construction we made (conscient or inconscient) through our education ? i think it is something we learn to be, not native.
>no amount of education is going to help a -repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.
you're probably right. i guess its too late for them, and learning not to be repulsed would be a hard work that i'm not sure they would want to do if they are ok like this. but i was talking before that. when we are children.
and i'm reaaaally not saying being asexual is a problem that should be cured. i have nothing to say about asexuality (or any form of sexuality or asexuality) as long as people are happy with it. my concern is only about being repulsed by body parts. concern being a big word here.","but the genitals do have a  connotation, no amount of education is going to help a -repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.","well it is just my opinion and i'm not going to force it.
i feel that any human should know the basic human anatomy, without disgust at all. we should be able to comprehend it without putting in any  aspect. but once again it is just my opinion, not backed by any science. but i feel people would be more relax about it if we could just see it as we see arms or ears. no emotions, just plain and cold.
see, im a hetero man, i have no attraction for men, but i can watch a male or female  with no disgust, and even tell people if there's something wrong like a visible skin disease, and tell them to go get checked.
but it is my way of seeing life. i'm really convinced people should know more about anatomy. we hide everything so much that it becomes like a secret, it gets mystical for some, and creates frustration, bad behaviour and so on, just because. i really feel if we would just treat organs as we do for ears, some problems would be avoided. not all, obviously, but some.
once again, only my opinion, not forcing it. i'm curious about yours, if you mind explaining. i wont tell you're wrong or im right, i would just understand other people's opinions better, and that is very good.",why would it matter if you're attracted or repulsed by them if you're not going to be near them or dictate what people should do because of what you believe.,"its ok to be asexual, but i don't find it ok to be repulsed by human body parts. if you remove , there still is basic biology, anatomy, plain and cold.",people gotta learn that it's okay to be asexual.

i've learnt to add that disclaimer at the end of my comments in case a random guy (or a teenage girl waiting for her prince charming) sees my comment and decides to tell me i'm wrong. i'm seriously avoiding that argument for the rest of my life.","i'm sure there are, too. i just haven't been in a relationship with one before.","men
they probably just liked the way you reacted so they kept going. sometimes they can be horribly selfish but they just act like they're oblivious, and they use that to be immune to getting called out when you say they don't care.

""you know how when you're listening to music, sometimes you put the volume up to get into the atmosphere? well that's not what happens when it gets too much. getting overstimulated is like someone yelling into your ears with megaphones.""
i think they should understand it after that.","very good point! i've had the pleasure of not really having my partner have trouble finding it, but i've definitely had it get too sensitive. unfortunately, a good number of the men i've been with have mistaken me practically trying to escape their mouth as it being pleasurable.","i'm what you just described but thankfully i'm not shy at all, and honestly my last relationship made me realise someone not putting in enough effort can really drive me insane, so i guess knowing if they give a  or not fairly early on in a relationship is good for me. so hooded small , *a blessing in disguise* xd plus the hood should give them an idea of where to find it, like it wont go anywhere.","one of my ex girlfriends had a lot of hood to move (which was fun to play with imo) and i have a very prominent  with only a small hood. i can understand having a hard time when there is a lot of hood over a small , but that isn't common enough that men who have slept with multiple women wouldn't have seen anything else.
but to add onto this, it just screams that these poor women/afabs don't have partners who listen during communication, which is very depressingly sad."
fair enough i guess everyone's experiences are different. my first gf i had zero idea what i was doing and thought discharge left on me was her  lol. my 2nd gf was more experienced and took the time to show me where to touch her with my hands or mouth and would be vocal about my speed and rhythm. within a week we had an amazing  life. i just don't understand the concept of 1) women who don't say anything and have   lives or 2) women being vocal and their men just ignoring them,"i wholeheartedly believe she has, i would know because i've done the exact same thing and guys will still just decide to do something else.","no i honestly don't lol. it's literally a trending meme about guys not finding the , i do not believe she has put his fingers on her  and communicated that it feels good and to continue touching her there and how she likes it.","do you not think she's tried to explain? these guys literally don't believe it exists, why would they listen?",sounds like it would be really easy for her to just point him in the right direction. i guess it's just easier to discuss  with her boyfriends male friend than with her boyfriend,"i feel bad for her, he needs to try harder",worst part is that they both have partners... i'm also friends with one of the girls and she said she finds it disappointing that her boyfriend doesn't acknowledge her  but puts up with him because she loves him. :(,"'they can't find the /that it doesnt exist'

"see that wouldn't weird me out as much. it's your parent sharing something about their health with you. i'd argue it's a good thing to slip into a conversation about  health & how to take care of yourself, the need to get checked etc.
of course there's a time and a place and a way to bring it up and it also depends on how open your conversations normally are. in my family we talk about anatomy,  health, pregnancy etc pretty openly. what i do not need to know about my older family members, however, is how many partners they have and what's the exact nature of each relationship, what their kinks are, etc. but as a generic topic, i'm al for normalizing the fact that  is being had and that sti's are a thing.","i remember when my mum told me she had genital warts. like there's a time and a place for it, and honestly? telling your kids or even family  like that is never the time nor place","eeew no please keep on never sharing that stuff with a family member from a younger generation.

edit to expand: in spanish roma culture you can either have a wedding or an ""arrejuntamiento"" (joining). a wedding brings more honor to the bride's family, and it includes the ritual of roses, where a designated elderly woman will stick a white handkerchief in the bride's  until the  tears a bit so they can show the ""roses"".
although the joining is also acceptable for many families, it's going to depend on how tradicional the patriarch is so there is some trickery about it. it's sometimes possible to bribe the  checker so she'll  her own finger, stuff chicken livers inside and whatnot.
there are also (although thankfully not common) bride kidnappings which is  up. some years ago the family of a kid in the high school where my mom works kidnapped the girl he had a crush on to force her to marry him. it's a very hermetic community so it never transcended if she was  or not or what consequences were brought upon the kidnappers family; as far as the school staff knows the police were brought only to report the girl missing and once she appeared they were asked to let it drop. thankfully the girl's family was not traditional so they did not force her to marry the boy.",what culture is it?

"**[body hair]( publishing in the british,have the most body hair)**
>body hair, or androgenic hair, is the terminal hair that develops on the human body during and after puberty. it is differentiated from the head hair and less visible vellus hair, which is much finer and lighter in color. the growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of androgens (often referred to as male hormones) and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.

the least hairy ethnicities, according to some googling, are asians and native americans. combined, these groups make up around 60% of the global population. we can assume that the majority of these women have less leg hair than this woman does. just going off of that alone shows use that the majority of women have less leg hair than this woman does.
but if we add in some other factors, there's more evidence. body hair starts to decline around 50 in most people, due to hormonal changes. this woman is young, probably at peak hairy years. a significant portion of the population is older than 50, around 35%. we can assume that most of those women have less leg hair than this woman.","the majority of women shave their legs because it's socially required, so i'm not sure how you would know.","for sure

"that's why i added the generalizations with ethnicity. idk why i'm getting downvoted here, i never made any judgements about body hair. saying that this is an above average amount is not an insult. some people have extra thick head hair too. some women grow full beards, and most only have light  hair or fuzz.","honestly i have no idea if you're right or wrong about this (my leg hair is pale and fine but not exactly sparse so it might look this way if it were darker but either way i'm just one data point) but i have to imagine that the women you know who are comfortable with not shaving having sparser/finer leg hair than this is not entirely a coincidence.
that is, if you're this hairy as a woman, you'd probably get a lot of comments and feel more pressure to remove or cover up the hair. so if most of the upper end of this curve is just fully removed, then the only 'natural' leg hair you end up seeing is relatively non-noticable, giving the impression that most women, if they let their hair grow out, will have relatively non-noticable hair too.

growing increased amounts of body hair while in a cast or similar device is a common occurrence. this is probably an unusual amount of leg hair even for this woman. normally, friction from clothes and washing and daily activities rubs off some of the hair and skin cells. when a limb is protected like this that doesn't happen as much and people grow more hair for a while.

that study does not support your statements about men's preferences. in that study, 36% of men were neutral about genital appearance. they don't give the percentage of men who preferred smaller , just that more preferred smaller  than larger . this does not mean that **most** men prefer smaller --after all, if 36% of men were neutral, that only leaves 64% of men that have a preference in either direction. the makeup of how many of those men preferred smaller to larger is not specified there (it could be 34% smaller to 30% larger, for example--leaving most men without a preference) nor is the strength of the preferences listed (strong preference versus mild).

definitely gonna check out that article and look up the disorder. i really appreciate you sharing that information. my gyn handles my contraceptives, but she and my psychiatrist would probably both want to know and discuss the possibility if i suspect anything following my reading. i wouldn't be surprised if i have it considering my litany of other health problems which all revolve around abnormal hormone and neurotransmitter levels. i'm actually on an ssri and used to be able to raise my dosage slightly around my tom to help control the psychiatric symptoms i get or have worse around that time, but unfortunately i can't anymore because of a high risk of delayed-onset serotonin syndrome, which can be very dangerous if allowed to persist.
i'm actually 29 right now which is why i have so much uncertainty around whether or not i want to have children. -shrugs- i'm also very wary of getting something inserted under my skin. i'd probably have an anxiety attack or faint during the procedure. so i don't want to commit to that until i'm sure just to avoid the emotional stress.
i hope you spoil the  out of all those kids *especially* since it's not your problem if they annoy their parents afterwards.","i just asked my mum and she said her sister always had truly awful  symptoms but she was only diagnosed in her late 30 - after she chased someone with a knife it's called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd) and she was put on a ""mood stabiliser"" (my mums term - i suspect she means ssri or barbiturate) as well as multiple forms of contraception.
if you think you might have pmdd you should definitely bring it up with your gp.

and just a side note regarding ""more potent birth control"", the implant is particularly good because your cycle returns to normal within a month of the implant being removed. it's not more potent, just longer lasting for ease. it's also more expensive because it's longer lasting. in the uk they won't put a woman on the implant if she has any intention of getting pregnant in the next 3 years because it's a waste of nhs money to remove it again when shorter term methods are available. if you have really good private health insurance, i imagine this wouldn't be a problem. also, birth control isn't measured in potency - consistent pill usage, iud and implants all have the same ""potency"" in terms of you not getting pregnant (within 1-2%). the only issue is non reversible methods - injection rather than implant or pill, for example. you can't take an injection out or stop taking it, you have to wait the 3 months until it's warn off.
if you definitely don't want to have a child in the next 3 years, get the implant. it doesn't impact your long term fertility levels or anything like that. and if for some reason you don't like it/it causes side effects/you suddenly decided you want to have a baby right now, you can just have it removed and be good to go in 4 weeks.
thank you for the good wishes! when i was 28-33ish and every single person i knew was having children, it was awful. i'd sob in the bath after each pregnancy announcement, despite being beyond happy for my friends. my partner and i are nearing 40 now and we love having lots of little people in our lives that we can enjoy spending time with - and then give back!!",". the way most people would react to me/treated me during & around my periods before i went onto the 3-month cycle of contraceptives, i always was under the impression that my severe instability and hyperarousal (refering to emotional state, not horniness ) was me being ""hysterical"", at least until i looked into it myself and realize that everyone else was just being an  because clearly if you're the only one *obviously* going mental because of ""normal"" hormone fluctuations, you must be a hypochrondriac or attention , right?
i'm glad your aunt got relief from her -triggered psychosis when she went on contraceptives and then finally when she hit menopause. it's insane what our bodies do to us. it really is. i agree wholeheartedly that periods .
i haven't decided yet if i want to try to have kids. i do know that if i do, i'll definitely go on a more potent form of contraceptive than the pill i am currently on after one or two and that will be the end of it. i sometimes wonder of i'm even fertile, though. i have a feeling conceiving may prove difficult if i decided to try.
i'm sorry that you are unable to have children, but i'm also glad that at this point it's also no longer an problem to you!","that sounds  awful for you. i'm so sorry you have to deal with that - but i'm really glad you had a doctor that listened and now you (only) have to suffer that 4 times a year. it's still too much, but better than nothing.
my aunt had  psychosis (not sure of the correct term) and it nearly destroyed her life. it wasn't the sensation or smell like for you, her  literally made her insane. the kindest, sweetest person you could imagine would morph into a monster - she'd literally plot people's  over the smallest slight. it was terrifying. they put her on the copper iud + mini pill while she was still menstruating and it help a lot. menopause is the only thing that's completely removed the psychotic thoughts/behaviours though.
i've been on contraception for almost as long as i've been menstruating (very late puberty) and i sometimes wonder how different my body would feel without bc. but not for too long. periods . i can't have children, and although it's taken a while, i'm now happy not to have them (i'm nearing 40) so why should i have to put up with painful, inconvenient, costly periods when they can safely be stopped?!","my gyn actually agreed to switch me to a 3-month cycle about 5 or so years back after discussing it with her. my quality of life goes to  whenever i have a period, so reducing it to 4 times a year was a massive boon to me. don't need to worry about the sensations of menstruating and feeling or smelling my own  making me feel psychotic and angry or deal with severe , heavy bleeding or cramping anymore since even the 4x a year are usually so light as to not even care now.
if your doctor is reasonable and there's no barriers to getting treatment (such as health insurance approval) to worry about, your doctor will give you what you need to improve the quality of your life. if they refuse without a valid explanation, get a new doctor. there's no real biological need to have a period once a month - or at all, really - if you aren't trying to get pregnant.
(""you/your"" = whoever reads this comment.)","i had a typo in that comment - i'm on the contraceptive implant (implanon i think it's called) and the mini pill. both are progesterone only because i have lupus. my first implant i had at 18 didn't stop my periods completely, the second one did, the third didn't so they added the mini pill in an attempt to stop them completely (i have pots too and my periods make that illness so much worse). it's been 6 years since i had a period or spotting and it's been a joy!
i'm not sure if doctors will prescribe contraception to stop  completely if it's not medically necessary, but implanon + mini pill is the way to go if can persuade a doctor in my experience.",if you don't mind me asking - what pill do you use? i always have troubles with bleeding randomly on the pill and it's becoming really annoying.,"the mess (on him) makes me a bit embarrassed/grossed out. not because he's shamed me in anyway, it just personally makes me a bit uncomfortable so i used to skip it. the contraceptive + mini pill has stopped my periods all together though so it's no longer something i have to worry about!

"no! tearing during first inter course isn't normal at all. thats the whole reason were bring up how this concept of breaking the  is harmful. thanks for proving my point.
there is absolutely no reason for there to be any tearing pain or bleeding during first inter course. no more than any other time someone has . it takes time, communication, emotional and physical comfort, and arousal and ther will be no pain (unless the person is an anomaly and has a condition that causes pain during ).
if there is pain during a persons first time then they have not taken the time to establish the above factors so the woman is not ready. she needs more lubrication and her muscles to relax more.
the first time i had  it hurt a little when we tried and i said that and my partner stopped and went back to  me until there was no pain when we went for it. it is completely unnecessary and honestly barbaric for it to be normalized that a woman has tissue damage causing pain and bleeding the first time she has  when neither are normal or necessary in any way.
lol your saying virginity is  while defending the concept that has been used to uphold and create and validate the concept of virginity for thousands of years through virginity checks and the concept that the first time a woman has  it is different than other times and results in pain or bleeding. because ther is a physical change that takes place and makes it so there's no pain or bleeding in the future and this change is observable and proof of lost virginity. it's all .
anyways. girls: if anyone ever tells you pain or bleeding during  is normal your first time they are wrong. they are lying. there should never be unwanted pain or bleeding during . if there is. stop and figure out what is wrong.","no! tearing during first inter course isn't normal at all. thats the whole reason were bring up how this concept of breaking the  is harmful. thanks for proving my point.

"nah. it's not normal that when i was in high school and most of my friends were having  for the first time. we would sit and talk and every girls story was the same. that it hurt so bad they were crying and got blood on the sheets. every girl saying it was horrible, they were so scared, it hurt so bad. every single one of us was under the impression that it hurt the first time you had  for an anatomical reason. that that was normal and was related to the  myth.
it doesn't need to hurt the first time you have  and it only does if the man isn't making sure that their partner is aroused and ready before they stick it in. why do men get to universally enjoy their first time but for woman it's ok that it's painful even when there's no reason it has to be besides the guy couldn't wait to get his  wet and/or both parties didn't know that if they just waited and worked up to it more the girl would relax and get wetter and it wouldn't hurt.
the first time i had  i said it was hurting so m partner stopped and went back to  me more and went down on me and then we tried again and it didn't hurt anymore. that could have been the story of every one of my friends too instead of a bloody horror story if they had known that what they went through wasn't necessary, wasn't related to anatomy or their , and shouldn't be  normal.
it shouldn't be normal or expected for women to have pain and bleeding the first time they have . that's  barbaric. like sorry no one told you and you had to go through that but it doesn't mean generations more of women and girls do. idk why you would want to perpetuate the idea that it's normal just so you can feel ok about your first time at the expense of every other girls coming after you. like i'm truly sorry to you that you had to go through that and didn't have a partner who said oh if it hurts then i want to stop and let's make you more comfortable or aroused. sorry you didn't get to enjoy your first time without pain.
you are bending over backwards to try to explain why it's ok for women to have their first time be painful and bloody. none of that matter when it's a completely addressable issue. and you're arguing against providing women the information they need to know to address it just bc ur  randomly bleeds sometimes like jesus get so perspective. so what. none of the  you said changes the fact that women bleeding and experiencing pain the first time they have  can be solved by just slowing down and helping the girl get more comfortable. which is also great bc if she's physically uncomfortable like that she's probably mentally u comfortable to. and will enjoy herself way more of she's able to relax. sorry i want women to enjoy their first time.
but just because you had to go through something  trying to normalize it so that other people have to go through it too is a really  up thing to do. you're literally saying that i'm shaming you by saying that women shouldn't experience pain and bleeding the first time they have . this has nothing to do about anything but your own selfishness and needing to justify your own experience even if it means hurting other people. ok got it.","it's completely normal. a lot of people don't really know their bodies at that point and don't really know how important foreplay is so they just go for it without making sure there's proper lubrication and so on. it's not ideal, but it's certainly *normal.*
in a perfect world we'd have people be super careful and prepared every time we have , but that's not a thing that exists, lol. it's completely normal to tear. i think you need to look up the word ""normal."" , i'm 34 and sometimes i jump into a quickie too fast before i'm fully prepared and even i'll tear. it's normal and i'm fine with it, lol. inexperienced people get just as impatient as experienced people do sometimes, and *that's completely normal.* you're sort of living in a delusional world where you seem to think  should exist within a utopian vacuum where everything is always prepared and perfect and innately knowledgeable and that's simply not practical.
is it avoidable? yes, sure. are people always actually going to do what they need to avoid it? no. losing my virginity personally didn't hurt at all because i was suuuuuper ""ready"" for it, but since then there have been times  does hurt because like i said, quickies or whatever.
i totally agree it shouldn't be normalized and it's barbaric that there are still cultures where a girl/woman has to prove she's a  by bleeding on the sheets on her wedding night, but that's not even what i'm talking about here. just in general it happens, and (i cannot stress this enough) *it's normal.* just as *it's normal* to not bleed or tear the first time. people need to stop seeing this in black and white.
and your little edit at the end to ""girls"" is way overarching. sometimes i get random bleeding from my  after particularly rambunctious  and that's normal for some women, at least according to every gynecologist i've ever spoken to. some of us do that when we get jostled. stuff happens. as i stated,  doesn't exist in some utopian vacuum.
any ""this is how  should be"" statement is going to shame someone and it's just as harmful language as the idea that women should bleed and tear losing their virginity if they're actually virgins.","no! tearing during first inter course isn't normal at all. thats the whole reason were bring up how this concept of breaking the  is harmful. thanks for proving my point.

"my preferences aren't in question. i shave my armpits because i like to shave my armpits. i don't shave my legs because i don't like the way they itch after i do.
however, you stated you think armpit hair is disgusting in your original comment. you implied ""on women"", but did not overtly state it. the fact that you think it's only disgusting on women and not on men, when it serves the same purpose no matter the human it grows on, says a lot about you.
the fact that you couldn't see that in my original question and instead deflected, pretending that the issue was something else, is why i used the word ""dense"". but i honestly don't care about your position as you refuse to acknowledge your stance is problematic.","can't state your perceived hypocrisy of it, have it explained why society, mainly western society, not even getting into religious stuff, and call anyone who explains why dense. you are, quite literally, being dense in the process.
what ever floats your boat, go for it. i'm also not a fan of ear stretching, long hair on men,  hair (on either sexes), and those nose rings that go in the middle. these are opinions i've gathered that i've honestly never really considered 'why' nor do i really care why.
far as under arm hair for guys vs girls - i've explained ad nauseam at this point why i and the bulk majority think this way. it's not some secret or sexist pact to keep women down. started religious, ended up a way to make a quick buck.
if guys who shave under their arms is what gets you going, aim for swimmers. or wait for an effective marketing to start pushing why guys should shave. someone will make a lot of money on that.","yep, this is exactly what i was getting at. too bad he's too dense to see it.","why is a woman's armpit hair ""disgusting"" and ""offensive"" but yours isn't?","my own pits or my own pr campaign?

thank you for that i need to subscribe to her. i always forget to,"you are very welcome! the ""momma doctor jones"" youtube channel is packed full of important and useful information regarding us females. she is an obgyn, and she goes over everything from periods and birth control, to the different ways of having babies. and then there's her running ""reaction"" videos of the tv show ""i didn't know i was pregnant"" which is so stinking hilarious!",thank you so very much.,"if you're in the us, the thinx brand is really good. if you're in canada, i'm pretty certain they ship there as well. i haven't had to worry about that stuff in about 10 years, so i personally never tried them as they weren't prevalent on the market yet. that being said, i have a friend, and my eldest daughter that uses them. my friend is on the heavier side of things, and she loves them, at night especially. she doesn't leak past the front or back of the over night pads anymore, because they couldn't ""reach perfectly"" to both front and back. my 16 yr old daughter uses them mostly after she is home from school and on weekends and overnights. she prefers them to pads on her underwear, even the ""ultra thin"" ones. we have discovered she has a sensitivity to something in multiple brands of pads, and is flat out allergic to the scented ones. (i accidently bought them one month, and she said she would try them. that ended badly.) her skin in that area is a lot happier as well.
there is another option you can do as well. i know for sure they're made on etsy. it resembles a pair of regular , or the thinx, but it has removable, reusable inserts that vary is size based on flow i believe. i saw them also on ""momma doctor jones"" video talking about what the different things are for menstrual cycles. when it's full, and it's time to change it, if you're out and about, you can carry a roll of baggies, like people have for if their dog poops, and use one of those for the liner. when you get home, you rinse in cold water, and put into laundry to wash it. (i learned the doggy bag trick when i was doing cloth diapers.)
i know was a lot more information then you were asking for, but hope it helped you anyways.",what menstrual  do you use/like i was wanting to get some and idk where to start looking,"hi there, i don't have much to add as i didn't use a cup for long (i prefer menstrual ), but i found out folding the top of my cup into an s shape was pretty efficient in terms of getting it to unfold easily once inserted
you'll get a hang of it, just be patient with yourself and listen to your body","ty for taking the time to explain me things
and the fold u r describing is the punch down fold i mentioned
tysm for saying it's normal i was concerened a bit
i am going to try tmrw again hope there will be some progress","hello there! welcome to your new cup :) once you get the hang of it it makes your life a whole lot easier!
everything you've described is normal-- it takes time to get used to it in you. you'll have to get used to being up close and personal with yourself as well. took me a few weeks of practice to get the hang of it's definitely easier when you're already bleeding as the blood makes it easier to slide in. not sure what fold you're describing but that takes a bit to see what works best for you-- personally i just tuck the top bit down so it makes a bit of a point.
try inserting while sitting on the toilet -- sometimes the angle is easier. i am hairy too so it could be your hair or your skin just may be sensitive there. always remember to have clean hands when you insert/remove!
personally i always check to see if it's opened by wiping a bit-- you'll still get blood initially but if you're still bleeding pretty freely a few min later you may not be opened. that takes a while to get used to also-- the way i fold it it always pops open once it's in. you may have to experiment with how far up you put it, etc-- personally when the nubbin is hanging out it's sitting too low for me, i like my skin to be able to close around it while i go about my day.

"just a few things
1. turkey has a very low english fluency rate, at about 16%, saying they all speak good english is a massive exaggeration, and is probably limited to the main large cities.
2. i didn't say bad english = bad  ed, but that it can be correlated to worse or more conservative education, such as highly religious countries or ethnostates where they choose to limit the teaching of the female body and foreign languages. my point was that these places with lower english fluency rates on average have very limited knowledge or teaching on female anatomy as well, as such, very bad english is commonly hand in hand with very bad knowledge of the female body. of course there are also groups in the us that weren't taught that either, but that is usually, once again, in the more conservative states.
3. the us is a mixing , as such we don't have any official languages, it's just that english is the most commonly known and spoken, therefore it is taught and learned as a first language, but it is still very common for other languages, like spanish and german, to be learned and taught as well, since we have a large hispanic population and many german cities that grew from early settlers.","i know quite a lot of turks, and they all speak pretty good english. as for lack of  ed, you can find that very easily in the us, where english is the official language (though tbh you can equally bad english grammar among native us english speakers if the internet is anything to go by). this person is clearly not a native english speaker, but that doesn't directly correlate with having no clue how the female body works. this person most likely comes from a country with worse  ed, but not everyone with bad english necessarily is.","many countries that have strict or ridiculous laws or religious rules against women and teaching knowledge of women commonly don't have secondary languages, like english, in the curriculum. as such, poor english capabilities is usually assumed that these people come from a country with little to no education on anatomy or  education as well, like highly conservative religious states or corrupt tyrannical governments that either are too poor or corrupt to fund education, are too religious and anti-women to teach about anatomy and , or choose not to educate their citizens. like how in places like turkey and belarus, which are very religious and conservative countries, blatantly refuse to teach anything relating to women's bodies, and many men their only have ridiculously preconceived notions about women and , saying things similar to the original post when interviewed, as well as how they would  their female relatives or significant other if they got a job or exhibited one of their poorly educated myths on biology. the justification they give for those murders is, ""to protect my honor, our tradition, and punish her for going against god""",why does the writers' english lavel have anything to do with their bizarre beliefs?,"ohh, okay, well that explains all the other ridiculous  ""clues!""",their native language is likely not english...,"in the last one, i can't tell if he is talking about the guy being a  or the girl.

exactly.,"just some small off topic pedantry, the us doesn't have an official language. but i agree with your comment, it's odd that people would assume non english equals bad  ed, seeing as there are non english speaking, developed countries with better  education than the us. a quick google seems to say the netherlands have the best  education (kind of hard to measure something like that but it seems to be the consensus), and none of the next few runners up on any of the sources i clicked through were english speaking.","i know quite a lot of turks, and they all speak pretty good english. as for lack of  ed, you can find that very easily in the us, where english is the official language (though tbh you can equally bad english grammar among native us english speakers if the internet is anything to go by). this person is clearly not a native english speaker, but that doesn't directly correlate with having no clue how the female body works. this person most likely comes from a country with worse  ed, but not everyone with bad english necessarily is.","many countries that have strict or ridiculous laws or religious rules against women and teaching knowledge of women commonly don't have secondary languages, like english, in the curriculum. as such, poor english capabilities is usually assumed that these people come from a country with little to no education on anatomy or  education as well, like highly conservative religious states or corrupt tyrannical governments that either are too poor or corrupt to fund education, are too religious and anti-women to teach about anatomy and , or choose not to educate their citizens. like how in places like turkey and belarus, which are very religious and conservative countries, blatantly refuse to teach anything relating to women's bodies, and many men their only have ridiculously preconceived notions about women and , saying things similar to the original post when interviewed, as well as how they would  their female relatives or significant other if they got a job or exhibited one of their poorly educated myths on biology. the justification they give for those murders is, ""to protect my honor, our tradition, and punish her for going against god""",why does the writers' english lavel have anything to do with their bizarre beliefs?,"ohh, okay, well that explains all the other ridiculous  ""clues!""",their native language is likely not english...,"in the last one, i can't tell if he is talking about the guy being a  or the girl.

">i don't get it, why won't they do some housekeeping?
cowardice and apathy is why. to the average lefty, someone else pumping a toddler full of drugs doesn't affect their lives, so they don't care enough to do or say anything about it. and those that *do* speak out are exiled from the ideological tribe.
dr. jordan b. peterson and bret weinstein were originally libcenters, who by speaking out against the left-wing extremists, were exiled from the tribe. the right-wing then promptly offered them a welcoming home, where ideological disagreements are plentiful, but rarely rising to the level of resulting in excommunication.
if the left doesn't want to be associated with these child abusing monsters, then they need to accept their exile collectively and move to greener pastures, like what dave rubin did.","i don't get it, why won't they do some housekeeping?

i'm not saying that isn't happening, but i can't seem to find anything referencing something like that. source?",no no i'm sounding exactly as i should be... some woke parents and doctors are now deciding to transition toddlers to opposite gender just because some boy liked dressing like girl ... it's very common if u read news.. i think everyone should have rights to do whatever to their body once they reach legal age but experimenting with bodies of children is evil..,you sound deranged.,problem is these leftist are now deciding what a 4yrs old kids (who have no idea what there rights are.. because u guessed it they are kids!!) gender will be ...and they have been treated as lab rats run by big pharma who want to sell as many hormone changing drugs as they can... even more than prozac ..,"children are such little ...  kids
wait, no! no, no, no! purple, that's not what i meant!"
just give him a moment he's just a touch ,then why do you type like you are high?,no i'm not lib left who just keep himself high and. does no work... i have to work and earn money so i don't get high during week days,"yes, but you are high.",high on what?? i'm stating facts what i have seen with my eyes,you are high.,problem is these leftist are now deciding what a 4yrs old kids (who have no idea what there rights are.. because u guessed it they are kids!!) gender will be ...and they have been treated as lab rats run by big pharma who want to sell as many hormone changing drugs as they can... even more than prozac ..,"children are such little ...  kids

gender dysphoria is same level that of ocd ptsd and adhd according to me.. and i'm pretty sure they don't require syrgeries or people around those affected to act accordingly to there wishes,"can you even  hear yourself?
that's not a thing anyone is doing. you know trans people are real right? and you know that trans people, just like  and straight people are that way from birth right?
so... you don't think kids can be trans?
i just linked a study that shows 94% of kids over the age of 5 that self identify as trans will remain so. of those that change their minds most of them turn enbys, and those that turn cis do so before the age of 10.",grooming them till age 15 to perform surgeries.. yeah ok good work,"at least you admit that is all we are talking about.
nobody is performing surgery on little kids, or forcing anyone to transition at 3 years old.",so removing healthy breast of 15 yrs old is fine?? u r a  ain't u??,"if you're talking about mastectomies, they are very few instances of that being given to anyone under 18, and in these cases we are typically talking about 15 year olds.",what other option will they have other than stay what they become?? u can't grow breast removed from healthy girls back.. can u?? all these data baffles me and other sane minded individuals who like children to first grow the  up before removing body parts ..,"also known as treating trans kids properly, when the kid, parents and doctors all agree.

"""one would assume high schoolers"". based on what? is there any scientific data to support this assumption?","periods are getting earlier and earlier, that's true, but we're talking about teenagers, and one would assume high schoolers, as that's where the most the popular media focuses on underage/teen pregnancies.
humans absolutely had shorter lifespans, and until not that long ago. you can't simultaneously say that malnutrition/low calorie diets, poor hygiene, poor medicine (a lot of the reasons you said are redundant or irrelevant, so i'm adding some), etc are relevant to age of puberty and birth rate, but not to longevity. there wasn't a proliferation of seniors until very, very recently in human history. the fossil record shows 30 year olds from a thousand years ago with the kind of illness indicators and deterioration you'd expect to see in someone twice that age today.
it's also interesting that you can go to parts of the world where young girls get married off as teenagers and start bearing children as soon as they are able, and see that those children have outcomes more dependent on social/environmental factors than biological. the kid who's mother is can't afford to feed him appropriately is not going to do as well as the kid who's mother can provide excess calories.","your comment is just factually incorrect. poor nutrition, low calorie diet, physically strenuous lifestyles in prehistoric times, meant that there was a later onset of periods. periods at 13 are an absolutely unnatural and modern phenomenon. (unnatural in the historical perspective)
also, humans didn't have a shorter lifespan, the average lifespan is brought down by the high number of infant and maternal mortality rates. ironically, childbirth was quite deadly. given that info, it's logical to assume that all the people in the prehistoric tribes would have been very protective of younger women's  experiences.

if you assert that fascism is socialist because the ""government"" owned the economy, then by the same logic, feudalism and monarchism are both ""socialism"" too.

"> this is not true, measures for depression such as beck's depression inventory are highly validated with chronbach's alpha's of over .8 in some instances. there is no such measure for gender dysphoria.
weird because the link you posted below mentions:
> (63.3%) of the boys met the dsm-iii, iii-r, or iv criteria for gender identity disorder;
which is a pretty comprehensive criteria for identifiying gid
and as for that actually study, yeah that looks pretty solid, but a few points i should mention
12% were noted as persisters, that is not ""so low that effectively there are no trans children.""
and the study itself gives a lot of extra details about that number.
> in steensma et al. (51), the dsm-iv-tr criteria were used. of the 23 persisters, 21 (91.3%) met the criteria for gid; in contrast, only 22 (39.3%) of the 56 desisters were threshold for the diagnosis, suggesting an even more substantial difference in the threshold-subthreshold distinction than was found in wallien and cohen-kettenis
so when a stricter criteria is used so that less kids are considered ""sub threshold"" then that number goes up dramatically.

">
this references studies that were done before the diagnosis of gender dysphoria even existed.
at the time, they used gender identity disorder, which wasn't just a different name for the same disorder, it had notably more relaxed diagnostic criteria. it was considered a behavioral disorder, which could be met simply through gender nonconformity. in fact, these studies and their findings are referenced as guiding factors for the diagnostic criteria change that came with introducing gender dysphoria in the dsm-v.
additionally, even with that more relaxed criteria, many children still did not meet the criteria. 30%-40% of kids (depending on the study) did not meet criteria for a diagnosis. meaning there was nothing to persist from in the first place. yet they were included in these ""desistance"" rates.
another limitation is the timeframe of these diagnoses, because they'd be done once at an average age of 7 then again after puberty.
that is not relevant to modern medical diagnosis. kids are evaluated up to tanner stage 2 of puberty and only then if they've exhibited persistent gender dysphoria are they even eligible for any kind of medical intervention.
so even if some portion do genuinely desist, the implication that it's puberty that causes it rather than them desisting prior to puberty is pure conjecture.
> leuprolide acetate is a common puberty blocker which is used to chemically castrate people
while they're taking it... there are precisely 0 people who've been made permanently infertile solely through the use of  hormone blockers. the effect is active only when on the medication. that's why the term ""reversible"" is used. because there's no scenario where discontinuing usage of blockers has resulted in infertility.",">the same is true for any psychological condition. but you wouldnt try to claim their are not depressed children.

op is saying he thinks genitalia are  on a subreddit about showing examplea of bad writing and representation concerning women.
you're going to have crossover with people into body positivity and people who are very female oriented.

took a few more years to realise that cis people also usually feel gender as an innate feeling inside them, and that *not feeling like you have a gender* is an innately trans experience.

"i learned i was autistic last year, and asexual today, so this is all sort of new to me.","sorry the downvote brigade got you. i also didn't realize that anyone enjoyed genitals (male or female) for most of my life. i'm also asexual (and autistic), so that explains why i never questioned that other people would think differently.

for me seeing someone's genitals is the same as seeing any other part of them i wouldn't normally see like their uvula or the inside of their nose. i'm not repulsed in any way, i just don't enjoy them more than any other part of the body. the genital pedestal is not a thing for me.

"well unlike books and movies, anime adaptations tend to be quite faithful!

"but if it's a problem with or affecting a *dick,* they'll fall all over themselves trying to fix it. even insurance is in on that. need some  or a  pump? insurance will cover it. but if women need birth control (be it for birth control or other reasons)? we're just dirty  that want to bang everyone. need a hysterectomy because a medical condition causes you horrific pain? but what if your future husband wants biological children?! you should wait for him, so he can decide.
...sorry. the way women are treated in the medical system overall is enraging enough but i also had a horrible time with my pelvic floor disorder. i saw **9** different male urologists before my pelvic floor disorder was diagnosed (my pelvic muscles were clenched up 25/7, which made it feel like i *always* had a uti). it took a female urologist less than 5 minutes to diagnose me. i went through so many tests-  tests, blood tests, multiple types of scans, even one where they stuck a tube with a camera up my urethra (it's supposed to be easy and short but as a  assault victim, it wasn't for me. they couldn't knock me out all the way so i had to work with my primary to find something that would sedate me just enough to get through it without making me unconscious. it still took me months to work up to it. the doctor acted like i was hugely inconveniencing him, which didn't help. normally i would've dropped a doctor acting like that but i was desperate and didn't want to start all over with someone new.
i did my own poking around after my diagnosis and i was so shocked to find out just how common pelvic floor disorders are, yet are talked about or even diagnosed. so if *doctors* aren't going to start the conversations on it, women will have to (like we do with so many other things).","exactly!! why aren't our doctors telling us these things, and helping to mitigate them?! it's not like the research isn't out there.
and thank you!","it drives me nuts that so many *doctors* aren't educated about it. or educated when comes to women's health in general. that's assuming they even believe us when we're sick and in pain. i have plenty of anecdotal evidence of it but statistics back it up.
happy cake day!","it makes me nuts that most women in the us are not educated about this, or diastasis recti.","france pays [pelvic floor therapy]() for *all* mothers. it prevents/treats a *lot* of the complications women regularly experience.
just a couple quotes from it:
>experts argue the benefits are profound, reducing women's immediate pain levels, helping to combat urinary and fecal incontinence and even making intercourse pleasurable again. it is also a long-term investment in public health.
>yet so many women aren't told to recognize when they're having a problem or encouraged to get help, to say nothing of the fact that nearly 1 in 4 new mothers in this country return to work two weeks after giving birth.

"> you mean as opposed to ""its a medical condition""?
no. this is a good example of what i mean by things being misunderstood.
go back twenty years and while there was often a medical component to transition, how most people conceptualized their identity was different. the notion of ""trans"" *as a lifelong identity* was not common. the term ""trans"" hardly existed, we mostly had tg and ts.
it was much more common for people to frame their identity around the gender they were transitioning to, and to see ""transness"" as a liminal state. it was a place you went through to go where you wanted to go. your identity was not constructed around a medical state and in fact we actively worked at the time to move away from terminology that was medicalized.
the modern idea of ""transmedicalism"" has almost nothing to do with how things were twenty or thirty years ago. it's more of a modern invention.","> the number of people who've recently come out as trans is overwhelming compared with how many there were before, and there just aren't the same numbers of ""old timers"" around.
thats just a natural consequence of people not living in fear or ashamed though, no? i saw your other comments in this thread and what you went through as a kid doesnt sound amazing, i can see why a lot of people would simply stay in the closet or  themselves if they can neither stay in the closet nor come out.
>it's that the current framing of things like the concept of ""trans""-as-identity is incredibly recent
you mean as opposed to ""its a medical condition""? i suppose i see what you mean if that is what you meant, it is a little odd to build an identity around what is essentially a glorified birth defect or a form of intersex condition (seems reasonable to call it that given how theres  differences in the brain for trans people), its a bit like  men and women who once they come out make everything about being  and it becomes the centre piece of their personality. but that phenomenon is also not really limited to trans people? theres black people that act exactly the same way around their skin, people with mental illnesses doing this too, some groups of women in general as well. everyone wants to feel special i suppose, and no one wants to feel as less than.
but ultimately such behaviour doesnt cause anyone harm nor invalidate whether these people are actually trans, so i'm not entirely sure why its necessary for people to know that transgender-ism(?)/transsexuality was once seen differently? is how its seen now a problem? i agree that how the world treats transgender issues is very different from 1980s but is it a problem?","i think this issue is much larger in the t community than in lgb. the number of people who've recently come out as trans is overwhelming compared with how many there were before, and there just aren't the same numbers of ""old timers"" around.
it's not so much mistakes that i want people to learn from, it's that the current framing of things like the concept of ""trans""-as-identity is incredibly recent. there's been a drastic sea change in the last ten years, more change than in decades before then.","> i was an activist and i think i have a lot to offer, but some recent transitioners seem to shy away from any idea that things used to be different and that historical perspectives are valuable.
i think this is more of a generational thing tbh, i'm not trans but i know a few people that are close to me that are and obv a bunch of non trans people as well, all of us collectively put zero value on history. a couple are history nerds and it interests them in general but none use historical actions to guide us today. we plain dont give a  what happened, if an issue exists today it makes no difference why it exists, it needs fixing regardless, the *why* may be interesting but in reality has zero value. its either a problem or it isnt
a history teacher i knew once loved to spout history is important to learn from so we domt repeat mistakes, yeah well, only real impact on the world i can see is china using  genocide of minorities as a  guidebook on how to genocide people better today without attracting attention. they sure learned - theyre using history as a lesson on how to create a more successful holocaust.","i think that's true.
i do find it difficult to get many of them to hear my perspectives. i was an activist and i think i have a lot to offer, but some recent transitioners seem to shy away from any idea that things used to be different and that historical perspectives are valuable.
i don't get as warm of a reception on trans forums when i talk about history as i did here.","i think the lack of historical perspective isn't willful ignorance, just ignorance.
a lot of these ""baby"" trans people are also young.","thank you. i feel a bit out of place in modern trans communities and it's nice to have my experiences appreciated. there's such a massive ""baby boom"" going on with trans people right now, there's almost no historical perspective.","thank you for that, that was interesting to learn more about"

oh wait. yes i do.","i didn't know at that time that i had vaginismus, only that  was difficult/painful. i got the iud because i was afraid i wouldn't take the pills on time, so it saved me that little worry, but it ended up causing more problems anyway. my ex said he could feel the string, i was in pain for days with major cramping, and over the year my period cramps got worse and worse every month, i only got the copper one without hormones. i'd never really had much cramping before, but each month it was more painful, until i finally had it removed, which was way freaking easier and i barely felt it at all. i switched to condoms, i wasn't having much  anyway.
yeah, it  sucks it's all on women, and all options have their own dangers and complications and can cause serious problems for some very unlucky women. just the iud had some major potential injuries, like perforation, which is horrifying to think about.
i've had 4 kidney stones, but the iud and the biopsy were far more painful than any of the stones i've had, and they were bad enough i could barely walk and kept feeling like i was going to throw up. at the time, i decided i was never ever getting one again, and i never will.
i warned my doc about my problems with the speculum and that an iud nearly made me faint, and she did try really hard to be as gentle as possible and took things slow, we waited a few minutes after getting the swab thing through my cervix because i was near screaming just at that. but i said we'd try since we were that far, and after a few minutes she tried the biopsy, but my   it was unbearable.
i looked around online a bunch after mine and it seems it's at least painful for most women, and excruciating for some. then there's the ones who were like ""lol it just tickled a little bit why are you so upset?"" because my body is different than yours and processes pain differently than yours, duh? unbelievable that doctors still lie and say it ""might be uncomfortable"", and force women to endure it was nothing for pain (and topical lidocaine is utter , it does nothing for me at all).","girl. i have vaginismus and i won't touch an iud with a 20 foot pole. i don't know if you did it because hormonal birth control is worse, but it's so dumb that 95% of the burden is on us. we have to feel the pain. we have to endure the side effects, the pregnancies, the abortions, the miscarriages. then there's the emotional burden on top of all that. ugh.","i  near blacked out getting an iud. darkness creeping in from the sides of my vision, sounds going dull, etc. it was excruciating. i recently needed a biopsy from the inside of my  and they couldn't finish because i started screaming ""no no no! stop!"" i have vaginismus so just getting a (small!) speculum set up was painful in itself. they put topical lidocaine on my cervix and it didn't do . those few seconds left my eyes watering and my entire body shivering from pain. i told her i am never doing that again without a sedative. luckily results were good so i didn't need to do it again, but   it was beyond painful in those few seconds, *worse* than the kidney stones i've had which themselves are extremely painful.
they need to toss this ""uncomfortable""  and tell it like it is.","i'm glad she takes it seriously and advocates for her patients but why can't gynos call iud insertion what it is. they always say it's ""uncomfortable"" or ""you're gonna feel a lot of pressure.""
kinda wish they would validate our pain more. it's indescribably brutal.","this! the doctor should've 100% asked him to step out to talk to her alone. at the very least the doctor should've explained to him why he was wrong and why these are normal things for a women's body. i have thick hair and if i shaved every single day i would have cuts, rashes, and in grown hairs. not to mention, anything inside the  that isn't normal to it can cause infections especially if she's prone to them. i'm prone to infections and can get them if i use the wrong type condoms or if i let someone finish in me.
the last time i went to get an iud in my ex boyfriend came with me. he kept making jokes the whole time and while she was putting it in, and my gynecologist looked him in the eyes and said, ""if you can't take stuff like this seriously than you shouldn't be having . she is getting this very uncomfortable procedure done for you. you should be holding her hand and comforting her rather than making jokes.""",the doctor shouldn't have treated it as a joke and should have pulled her aside to see if she needed help escaping a possibly dangerous situation.

the first neurosurgeon i saw pretty much told me i was  and to see a pain management doctor as there was nothing he could do with out permanently disabling me.
less that 4 months later i finally get a second opinion from a highly recommended neurosurgeon. he asks me how i walked into my appointment on my own two feet, he expected someone in a wheelchair when he saw my mri. he already had a game plan ready to go when he met me, several other doctors, nurse-practitioners, nurses, etc all came to meet me and review my images and do an exam. he explained the surgery he wanted to do, how it would relieve the pressure and hopefully i wouldn't have any permanent damage from waiting so long. he insisted on doing the surgery as soon as possible. two weeks later, i'm out of surgery and even in the icu i felt better than i had in years.","the sports med specialist i saw was unable to comprehend long term damage due to an unresolved meniscus tear (he outright accused me of lying and said he would not help me). he didn't order any other testing and only used a plain x-ray.
i felt so humiliated and  because of him that i didn't seek another doctor for 2 years.
this second doctor, an ortho, ordered an mri. guess what? that meniscus tear degenerated into  scar tissue inside my knee due to never being fixed because of , dismissive doctors. my ortho says it's inoperable and can't be repaired. yay permanent injury!
however, *none* of my previous doctors could diagnose why i was in constant bone, joint, and muscle pain, my knees wobbled and i was unsteady on my feet, why i was chronically fatigued, why i am weaker than i should be, why my skin takes an eon to heal injuries, etc until i figured out the problem and asked for a referral to a doctor who would understand it.
i have a genetic disease that  up my collagen, and since collagen is in almost all tissues, it causes problems all through my body. my physical med doctor immediately recognized joint hypermobility disorder/connective tissue disease within 20 minutes of seeing her.
i feel like some doctors do not actually want to explore other possible diagnoses, which leads to people having permanent injuries and lifelong pain. it  me off that no one ever thought that my hypermobility might actually not be normal.

not necessarily, and definitely not to the point of it ceasing to be pleasurable. a woman who has never had  and is extremely in her head about it can experience vaginismus (extreme tightening of the  to the point of  being near impossible), but other than that, a  will not be looser its 100th go than its 10th.","there may be a bit of truth to the myth for entirely different reasons. correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't the tightness/ looseness of the vaginal walls connected to arousal and relaxation levels? if so then it would make sense that a woman who has lots of experience with  would have more confidence and therefor be more relaxed then a woman who has little experience. regardless of how the myth is used now, it makes sense that men would come to this conclusion on their own. especially when one considers how we men tend to analyse things with a physical view rather then an emotional view.

"if you're male and unaware of this, but the ""husband stitch"" isn't a real medical procedure, and it's mainly done by the doctor without the patient's consent or knowledge and by the demand of the husband, so it your partner gives birth, you just have to make sure the doctor doesn't go stitching parts that shouldn't be stitches just for the  pleasure of one of you (the male one of you), it can also be dangerous to the woman and cause infections and other complications.

", ""i get shadow banned for no reason"". sure, dude bro. yeah, i'm so sheltered. i'm sheltered even though i don't have a family and i do everything by myself. who is sheltering me, dude bro? continue telling me man #2959374858374938 how men are oppressed and women are .","hey, you hate me and you don't even know what my point is or who i am. rofl. how dumb could you be? hey, that's your prerogative though. you seem hate filled. it's not my fault that other men messed you up. you don't see me holding my trauma against all women. yet, here we are.
but hey, you're right - she doesn't need to explain herself to me. she doesn't need to shut me up either - i get autobanned automatically for no good reason. what do you think she is? she's not an idiot, nor is she a child.
tell me again that i'm not oppressed. haha!  lady, you must live a sheltered life. isn't that right college girl?
in short, i don't like you either. it's people like you who oppress me. no really, why are women so nasty about conversation? i don't think i've ever had a dude report me to the gestapo. it's always a girl who does it. why is that? that's what got me permabanned.
hey, let us talk about that too. do you think children are  beings? or do you think i should have my head cut off for even bringing it up? rofl.

my first ever boyfriend. i was 15 and amazed that someone actually paid positive attention to me, so i was enamored. he lied about his age, said he was 16 when he was actually 23. the first time we were ever intimate, he sexually assaulted me. it completely changed me as a person and i will forever miss the person i used to be. i already came from a home that was immensely abusive, but what he did was just the final straw in terms of being broken down as a person. it put me into a spiral of bad decisions and bad choices in men.
it took me several years of working on my own, as i was underage and my parents didn't believe me, to find some modicum of ""normality.""
then i met my second-ever boyfriend, who was emotionally manipulative and a horrible person overall. he had an extremely high libido but 0 idea about women, other than ""dick go in and feel good,"" (i had to explain to him what the  is), and constantly pushed me for , made me feel bad for not wanting it, despite him knowing what i had been through. every  encounter with him was like reliving that nightmare over again. so when i got the courage, i dumped him and stayed more or less single for nearly 9 years, beyond a couple other attempts with some pretty clueless guys. i changed myself for the better, found hobbies, found my real family, i went through a whole  of a lot of therapy and self-growth.
and then i met my current partner. he listened, he didn't push, he eased me into things. he was actually overly cautious, and went above and beyond to make sure i trusted him with my body, that i was ready, that i was okay the *entire* time.
i am not making a blanket statement or generalization of saying ""men are inept,"" but that the men i was with were inept, selfish, or terrible people.",hmm,"i'm not blaming it on anyone beyond my partners who were incredibly selfish, inept lovers lol","christ, it took me until just last year to actually have a proper  thanks to anxiety and inept, selfish partners, and i'm bloody nearly 30. got on proper dosage for anxiety meds + mild sedative, and met my partner, who went above and beyond to make me comfortable and ready.

"+1 for the write up, well said","> women are these evil beings without actual feelings.
i think this is a misunderstanding. in a _vast_ majority of cases where men hold these views, women are not really seen as ""evil"".
---
firstly: most women are ""good women"". that is, most women are women who either actively conform to their ideals or, much more often, women who simply do not speak up in ways they perceive. a ""good woman"" doesn't have to actively conform to those ideals, so long as she doesn't do anything to speak up, attempt to stop, or attempt to change a man's behaviour should he hold those ideals. a store manager who actively looks the other way when a floor manager gropes female cashiers is a ""good woman"", but so is a cashier who simply quietly takes it and doesn't say anything in a way that affects the assailant negatively.

secondly: most ""bad women"" are not evil, but are instead ""corrupted"". there's a huge theme that goes around misogynistic circles: **degeneracy.** degeneracy is the idea that the ""natural moral structure"" of the world *(in which women are subordinate to men amongst other things)* is being corrupted and disrupted, leading to women acting in ""unnatural"" or ""inappropriate"" ways.
people who subscribe to the degeneracy concept nearly-invariably believe that idealised womanhood is one of the young girl who exists in a childlike state of nonsexual innocence until she becomes sexually mature. this maturation is also often idealised, with it often portrayed as occurring somewhere between the age of 13 and 15 wherein, after a short (typically one yearish) growing period, the child is suddenly and immediately a woman, though of course she is still required to be a naive young ingenue who is both physically beautiful but unaware of sexuality or , while also being immediately sexually available to ""men"". these young women are immediately the idealised ""good woman"", who is subordinate to men and will immediately marry and have  with the first ""good man"" (note: all men are good men in this story ""except bad men"", which tells you so, so very much...) and be a ""good wife"" etc.
failing **literally any** stages of this fantasy is ""degeneracy"".
the problem, though, is that it's not called ""degeneracy"" for no reason. it's believed that failing at _one_ of these points causes moral weakness in young girls and young women, which makes further ""degeneration"" more likely. women who are open about sexuality, or display personal  confidence or knowledge, or who dress in ways that suggests they both understand and wish to enjoy - or, worse yet, _control_ -  are seen as conclusive evidence that one slip-up leads to a slippery  of degeneration that turns women into miley cyrus or brittany spears, both of whom have been labelled as ""degenerate"" many, many times. these women are seen as a kind of moral toxin, corrupting ""good women"" into ""bad women. they're not exactly **evil**, so much as they're... almost like a disease? they're kinda treated like you'd treat someone carrying a plague who refused to quarantine: not evil so much as polluted.
---
thirdly: feminists are not _""really""_ women. feminists are the ultimate end of degeneracy: they're a final and in a sense terminal corruption of women away from the fairytale ""ideal"" and towards that kind of... morally polluted mess. feminists aren't evil women so much as just kinda... evil. they're often intentionally desexualised, with the goal in mind of removing the ""woman"" label from them entirely. for example, i can name at least 5 far right-wingers off the top of my head who have said on twitter, at least once, that ""[they] wouldn't even  her [any given feminist, often anita sarkeesian]"". the goal of this is to **dewomanise** them, to remove their  value from people's minds. since their version of a woman is inherently  (either a ""good woman"" or a ""bad woman"", depending), by saying ""i wouldn't forcibly violate her under pretence of sex"" they are trying to remove that person from the category of ""woman"", good _or_ bad.
**feminists aren't seen as evil women.** they're seen as a kind of moral disease that infects society, because **they're not seen as being really women at all.**
this is also why you see so much transphobia directed at them, trying to ""smear"" famous feminists as ""secretly men"" and labelling them as transgender. the goal is to make them _not women at all_, but just another example of ""degeneracy"": they want to turn them into a poison rather than a person. trans people are seen as so bad because trans people  their nice tidy view of what (not who, what) a woman is and introduces the idea of women as more than  objects and reproductive units. trans people force society to have a conversation about not just _what_ a woman is, but ***who*** she is as a _person..._ and these people aren't willing to have that conversation. instead, trans women's existence serves as another way to try to  womanhood from those who are seen as too ""degenerated"" to be ""fixed"".",i really hope you're wrong but probably not based on some things i've heard from some men. it's frightening how entrenched they are that women are these evil beings without actual feelings.,"> eah he's going to paint himself as te victim
he's not. he _is_ the victim in his own mind. he's not painting himself as anything, he's going to describe his perceived victimhood. ""painting"" implies he knows he isn't but is pretending: he knows he is and is describing his victimhood. to him, this is some sjw feminist firing him for no reason because she didn't like what is, to him, totally normal behaviour for a man in his 30s. he's going to absolutely, 100% believe that she is in the wrong and this will only confirm, to him, that feminists are out there to destroy masculinity and men.",yeah he's going to paint himself as te victim to anyone who will listen and again double down on anyone who says anything otherwise.,the only lesson he learned is to keep his creepiness quieter. he will never understand why he got fired and will blame the boss for being a  to him over some little thot.,"hard agree, why do people have to say these things??",what the  is wrong with people.

i think your definition is technically correct. the best kind of correct.,"meh, i consider anyway into or out of a person an orifice, may be my definition is too lax.","i'm afraid you're slightly mistaken. the [nasolacrimal ducts]() drain into the nasal vestibule, that's why your nose runs when you cry. the nasal vestibule does have openings into various cranial sinuses, but they're [not particularly close]() to the nasolacrimal duct opening (look for the second label from the bottom on the left).
that said, this is why i said i could see an argument. but if you're going to accept the lacrimal puncta as orifices then you open up other possibilities like mammilary ducts (not to mention the lacrimal ducts draining tears from the lacrimal gland *into* your eyes) and we go off on an academic tangent that is no longer tethered to the common understanding of the word ""orifice.""",eye ducts certainly are. the lacrimal ducts drain your tears back in to your sinus.,"i don't think that eyes are generally considered to be orifices. tear ducts i could see an argument, but it's a bit of a stretch (although i do remember seeing a ripley's believe-it-or-not video of a man who could force corn kernels up his nose and out his tear ducts).","well don't we typically have seven above the neck even without the tear ducts? two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and a mouth. of course, i'd get into sweat glands, but i'm an ","the average person has more than seven orifices.

"my first piv experience was with my now husband, but we were both religious and grappled with the guilt so much that after marriage we still struggled for a few years (married 12 years now and everything is happy and fine, and he's a wonderful human!) but i've learned that being raised uber religious is an entire different experience than what the non-religious people went through. i could absolutely be wrong (again, i always want my biases checked), but i think people raised non-religious have an advantage we didn't have. there's no weird guilt around a lot of things that shouldn't cause guilt. my life was basically dictated by guilt, and even though i've been out of religion 10+ years, guilt over   is still something i fight.
again, biases on my part, but i think you're lucky for not being raised religious.","that is pretty, crazy to think of, i was born into a very non religious family but, then again i don't really know anyone from denmark who is, sounds crazy to have those moral dilemmas as a teenage girl, who has the pressure of years of religious teaching and the pressure of someone you love, sounds awful
:c","no no no, that doesn't mean you're not a clever person! guys have absolutely used the ""loophole"" narrative to pressure girls into  when they won't budge on the no piv  until after marriage!
it's just that some girls come to that conclusion themselves too because when you're a sexually mature teen in relationships that, without your religious convictions, would otherwise turn , it's really hard to abstain from  acts altogether, but the guilt of -before-marriage is also too hard of a burden to bear! so it's easier to just pretend there's a ""loophole.""
 loopholes are a great example of human complexity in ways that are hard to describe if you haven't been in a situation to rely on it or be manipulated into it.","ahhhh, makes a lot of sense, i just assume it was something guys said to girls who refused , im not a clever person.","how do i explain it? it's kind of a double think thing. everyone knows it's ridiculous (at least in the back of their minds), but being a healthy  teen will make you do mental gymnastics. the term [""anal loophole""]() itself is a joke among catholic kids mostly, but also in super christian teen circles (i was raised southern baptist). but the joke is rooted in something that actually happens. basically we were taught that ""real""  is  in  (piv) . so, really  teen girls will eventually give in to  and   (even though biblically this would probably fall under sodomy depending on your translation). we ""knew"" it was still a sin, but any excuse to express our sexuality and yet claim it was okay was really a necessity. so girls wouldn't have piv , but would instead have   so they could try to justify how they weren't perpetrating the sin of  before marriage rule.

"i would still say no, because people who have afab reproductive organs and don't identify as female could very well have their  designation legally changed, and use different pronouns, so ""female"" simply does not apply to them, whereas afab will apply to every person with afab repro organs because they were all assigned female at birth, and later on got to choose what they wanted to present as. afab remains the safest choice, and i always abide by the safest choice. these terms could change in the future, but for right now this seems to be the best we have to make sure everyone is included.","definitely! just want to also mention that i try to say afab (assigned female at birth) anatomy when referring to traditional feminine anatomy. it includes trans men and non-binary people who have vaginas, uteruses, etc.",yeah you've come to the right place of you wanna learn about feminine anatomy lol,what don't you understand?,i honestly still dont understand that nor has it clicked with me but(im male) at least im not vocal like some.,basically. like i know i was told i had something called a  in 5th grade but it never clicked bc i just never knew there was another hole. i was just really confused,so schrodinger's ?,i didn't even know i had a  until 8th grade. literally didn't know that hole was there. it never surprises me the extent to which we dont teach young women and girls about their own freaking bodies

"are there different goals that are more realistic you could choose that could lead to more happiness?
i went back to school when i was 35 after spending 15 years in a job i hated. originally i wanted a doctorate in psychology. i didn't get in to the program i interviewed with, and i spent several months depressed as  because that was my goal, that's what i wanted, and it felt like  to even think about changing my goal. but it got to be the time of year when i needed to get my grad school applications in if i wanted to be considered for the next year. i did some thinking about what exactly it was that i really wanted to do. long term, my goal was to be a therapist in private practice. i wanted to get there by getting a doctorate because i also wanted to do research, and because i love psychology and i wanted deeper knowledge. so, i thought about how important each of those goals actually was to me, were there any i could let go of and still be satisfied, and what alternative paths could i take for the ones that are non-negotiable. i decided doing research wasn't really a huge priority for me. it would have been interesting, but it isn't what i want to do. getting a deeper knowledge of psychology isn't something that requires getting into a doctoral program. i can do that on my own. so that left becoming a therapist, and i could do a master of social work program that would take me far less time and be a lot less stressful, and i wouldn't have to move like i would have if i'd done a doctoral program.
so, i applied to msw programs. i got into one, and i graduate in may. i'll be a licensed independent therapist probably when i'm about 45-ish (you have to accrue a bunch of hours under supervision before you can get a license and practice independently). sometimes i'm a little sad that my career as a therapist is going to be shorter than it would have been if i'd gone back to school earlier, but then i think about the alternative--staying in this awful career.
my student debt is pretty gnarly, but meh. i'm in the same boat as a lot of people, and if my choices are ""shitty career where i'm miserable"" and ""career i love but i'll be paying off loans for the rest of my life,"" the second one sucks in some ways, but it is better. and it isn't necessarily true that i will be paying off those debts for the rest of my life. there are programs that i will qualify for to pay them off (i live in an underserved area, so i can apply for this program to pay off my debts), so that gives me some hope.
anyway, my point in all this is to say, when i was depressed about my age and really ruminating on that, it wasn't doing anything to improve the situation. sitting down and making a new plan that was both realistic and better than my current life is improving the situation.","my goals are expensive and unrealistic. had i done things differently 10 years ago when i was 19, they wouldn't be.","what do you think is more likely to result in more happiness for you, ruminating on these thoughts that you've wasted your life, or saying to yourself, ""it sucks that i feel this way, but instead of beating myself up for how i perceive my past, i'm going to think about what i value and choose some goals to pursue that support the things i value""?",okay but what if you're about to turn 30 and feel like you've already wasted what little life you've lived,i'm 44 and i am so effing glad i am. hooray for our 40s. i've got some sh+/ sorted out but most of me still works physically and i might even get another 40 years on this beautiful planet,i'm having an age-induced existential crisis and want to die,">late 2019, when i was 14

the actual text is pretty vague about the precise nature of her bleeding problem (since, after all, it's not really the point of the story). apparently some scholars do view it as menorrhagia. in jewish law,  makes you unclean for the duration of a period, so a woman suffering from constant  would suffer a lot of social and religious isolation as a result.",which story was this? i don't remember it.,"there's even a story in the bible that says periods are normal, though technically jesus heals someone from having a chronic period in the process so...","i don't get how people see periods as ""dirty."" i mean, ok, yea, in the literal sense, sure. but the metaphorical or spiritual or whatever sense that you describe just doesn't make sense to me.","yea i know a lot of older people who have no idea about this stuff. when i started using tampons as a teen my mom told me to hide my  box in my room because my aunts also thought virgins couldn't use tampons and would cause a huge fuss about it if they saw them in my bathroom.

""what do you mean there's no dinner? you're all unclean?""","some other woman or girl. these are *old* superstitions. daughters would help around the house almost since the age they could steadily walk while boys would begin training in ""manly"" work. unmarried women would contribute to the households of their families (which household was determined by the culture) and women worked until they died.
on top of that, marriage meant (and still means) different things depending on the culture. in some places, a man may have had several wives. these were not  marriages, though. this was about created a secure economic unit which, i might add, has been true for most forms of marriage throughout history.
so there was almost always another woman around to help out. also, the whole women are unclean bit is almost entirely limited to the abrahamic religions (christianity, islam, judaism, etc) and the places where they held the most sway. in most other places, it didn't matter and some even considered bleeding to be a positive thing because they recognized its connection to procreation.","i was always curious about how this worked though: if a woman who normally kept the house clean and prepared the meals was out for a week ""dirty"", who did the work?","yea i know a lot of older people who have no idea about this stuff. when i started using tampons as a teen my mom told me to hide my  box in my room because my aunts also thought virgins couldn't use tampons and would cause a huge fuss about it if they saw them in my bathroom.

"i wish i had said something to the nurse, but i have a problem with over politeness so i just smiled and hid my embarrassment, then tried to laugh it off, and only realized how deeply it cut me much later.
my  were the same during puberty and you can't even tell now. i wouldn't spend much time or energy stressing about them if i were you.
with my first pregnancy, i remained mark free until the last month, and then i cried, but those faded really quickly. i was wearing a two piece the very next summer (fall baby). my stretchmarks from baby 2 are just so big it's warped the shape of the skin which is hard to get over. the color is fading but i can't say it really looks better. it would probably help if i lost some of the extra weight from being so sedentary during my difficult second pregnancy, but between breastfeeding, hubby being deployed, and the pandemic, i haven't had a lot of free time, childcare options, or gym access. but slowly, i'm getting there.
the hardest part has been mentally reconciling the way i see myself in my head aka pre-baby body, and what i see in the mirror now. i may not even look that bad to other people, but the contrast between the two images is startling to me and makes my ""flaws"" more obvious to me. we are all our own worst critic.
i'm so glad your fiance is so supportive. it makes a world of difference to have a partner like that. someone to embrace you and encourage you to embrace yourself as is, without nitpicking.
thanks for commiserating with me.","i am sooo self conscious about the ones on my , like literally both of them are just 100% stretch marks at this point. i'm only 33wks along to so i guess there's still time to get marks on my stomach. the one's on my butt/hips are so faint i have to point them out for people to see them, so they don't bug me anymore. they did when they were visible, thankfully time did right by me with those.
i can't believe that nurse said that to you, that's so messed up and unprofessional. i would probably just completely break down sobbing if that were me.
i get not being able to be comfortable in your post-partum body, i'm not there yet, but i'm not even comfortable in my pregnant body with all the weight gain so i'm sure i'll continue to have issues after as well.
i'm glade your husband is so good to you. my fiance keeps telling me he's excited for how i'm going to look post partum, apparently mom bods are his thing so maybe that will help me.","i have very easily stretch-marked skin. i went from being an athletic skinny kid to a very curvy teen during puberty and i got lots of stretch marks. they faded and didn't affect me much in the long term.
as i expected, i also got stretch marks during my pregnancies. the first wasn't so bad. i even wore a bikini after and was barely self conscious. my second pregnancy was much more difficult, and the baby wasn't positioned correctly, so he sat really far forward and stretched my stomach painfully. right after he was born, there was a young male nurse came in to check my abdomen to make sure everything was doing what it was supposed to and when he saw my stomach he said, ""what happened...? these are all stretchmarks??!?!"" it really hurt to hear something like that from someone who has seen a lot of post-partum tummies, and it really stuck with me. i know a lot of women are like ""you earned your tiger stripes! flaunt them!"" but i just can't yet. fortunately, my husband is amazing and has almost convinced me that he still finds me attractive and doesn't think i'm damaged.

i agree that it is dehumanizing and should examine our reactions so that we can change our implicit views. i do think though that it is a gross overexageration to say that anyone who has been influenced into feeling this way without examining it thinks that a woman is worthless unless a  or wants to  their daughter,"society conditions their individual views. and their way of thinking is still dehumanizing to women and shows that on some level (that they may not even be aware of) they don't view women as a human being with full autonomy the same way they do themselves. this way of thinking of virginity in women originates from women being treated as property in the past, and their virginity something that ""belongs"" to their father, and later, husband. we like to think we've outgrown patriarchal ideas, but we really haven't, we just rationalize them differently or don't examine our reactions too closely, as you said.",i think this is a little bit of an accusatory view. i dont think that these views necessarily come from individual views but societies view that women are worth less when they have  compared to men who are worth more. it's completely normal to hold a view opposite to what you have been programmed to feel. a father then may feel more defensive about a daughter than a son having  without necessarily believing the daughters worth comes from her virginity or wanting to  her. i'm not saying there are not fathers out there (such as ops) who do want control over their daughters sexuality but i just dont feel like it is always the case. i believe a lot of the time they dont know why they feel that way.,"i have always said it's just so inherently creepy when the men of a family take so much interest in the ""sexual purity"" of the women in the family.
they can rationalize it however they want, but it seems like they (a) only see women as objects whose only inherent value is their virginity or (b) really, really want to  their female family member themselves.
especially since these same men don't seem to put any value or taboo on their male family members' virginity. they see nothing wrong with the guys , but the women are absolutely forbidden.","it will forever boggle my mind how much time some men spend thinking about their kids' genitals.

"yeah i can understand that. i was about 6wks when i had mine. and yes, i've heard great things about canada! i'm dealing with other health issues right now and getting the assistance i need has been a nightmare. i was just on the phone with my mom last night (she has chronic pain and serious health problems too) and was telling her how much i wished i was in canada right now lol. hopefully one day i'll get to visit though.","yes one of the perks of living in canada! we also have free abortions, but the clinics are few and far between. you can get abortions at local hospitals but most will only do them within 4-12 weeks of being pregnant, so you would have to catch it quick.",well i'm glad i'm not the only one who has known other women who do that. at least they had access though. i said in another comment how a lot of clinics in my area have closed over the last few years. i'm not sure how many are left now but it worries me for others seeking access to abortions. no woman should be deprived of that right. that's good you live somewhere where birth control is free though. i've known so many women that struggle to get it.,"i know your getting downvoted, but i have friends in similar situations. some women do use abortions like contraception, very few but i know people who have had 6+ abortions. they can have unprotected  for 6-12 months before they get pregnant, and they'll end up just having an abortion instead of using contraceptives.
is that the majority of women getting abortions? no, absolutely not and it  me off when people claim this.
should they have a right to use abortions as contraceptives? i think so, you should be able to do whatever you want with your body.
do they need better access to contraceptives? yes, and better education on the matter.
will that fix this for everyone? no, probably not. i live in a country where birth control is already free.",did i say it was wrong of them to get multiple abortions? no. i simply stated i've known women who have had multiple and their reason why. i agree completely if they didn't want more children or couldn't provide for them then that was their choice to go that route. better that than bringing more children in the world that will struggle to survive.,"why does it matter if they had 3+ kids? maybe that's all they could afford to feed/school/house. maybe they didn't want more children, maybe there was something wrong with the pregnancy. or hmm maybe idk they didnt want more children? isn't a good parent someone who doesn't have more kids if they know they can't care for them?","i agree to a point. women don't just go get one after a night with their partner as easily as walking to the convenient store but i have known women that have had 5+ abortions. pretty much, each time they got pregnant after being unsafe they'd get one. and they usually already had 3+ kids.
edit: downvote if you want. i'm have nothing against abortions. i've had 1 years ago myself. every woman should have access to better contraception and healthcare. and i agree it's better if they're unable to provide for those children or just don't want any more. every woman has that right to choose. i'm just stating that i've personally known a few women who have done this.

"exactly. rarely does anyone who claims they know women (notice the plural form being used here and in ops statement) who've had 5 or more abortions have been told personally by the women about the procedures. almost every time i hear someone say they know women who've had 4,5,6, or more abortions it's always through a friend of a friend who told them about it. it's  man.
it's a  urban legend. i knew of someone who supposedly had multiple abortions in high school too but she obviously hadn't. it was just a rumor. show of hands.... how many of us here have heard if a woman who was forced to actually carry a pregnancy after being told by the state she had too many abortions? i've heard it at least twice only that's not actually a thing. there are no state laws mandating women being forced to carry to term after they hit a certain bar of abortions. that's not a  thing. it's just a side ways attempt to shame women about sexuality and demonize abortions while pretending to be pro choice.",">everyone has heard from a friend of a friend that so and so has had that many.
and who goes around telling people how many abortions they've had. i mean other than maybe your close family or really close friends? (not that people should be ashamed for having had an abortion, but it's not really something people do bring up in casual conversation.)","it does though. in the us abortions are between $400-2,000 each depending on how far along the woman is. at minimum 5 abortions would be $2,000 and at max it would be $10,000. most people couldn't afford something like that. the ""i know women who've had 5-6 abortions"" is an urban legend. everyone has heard from a friend of a friend that so and so has had that many. the fiscal reality of it all is that in the us that many abortions is simply unaffordable for the vast majority of women.","still doesn't change what op is trying to say, but nonetheless i was providing a possibility to the comment above me, who was asking how someone can afford multiple abortions",op is from the us.,"psa: not everyone on reddit is from the us.
where i'm from abortion is literally free. does this mean that women get abortions as a hobby? no. but i too, know women who have had multiple abortions.",i don't believe you at all. abortions are like 800 bucks. are these so called women rich?,"i agree to a point. women don't just go get one after a night with their partner as easily as walking to the convenient store but i have known women that have had 5+ abortions. pretty much, each time they got pregnant after being unsafe they'd get one. and they usually already had 3+ kids.

"aye, most folks where i live now are quite shocked when i tell them how awful it was in my school. i think most schools do have decent  ed but a lot of religious and rural schools just never caught up with the times. and because people generally seems to think that we've good  ed and because the areas where it is lacking are religious and rural, nothing was ever really done about it.","honestly, i'm pretty shocked by this. i was expecting you to say 45+. i'm from the midlands and we had videos demonstrating the changes your body would go through, how to apply a condom correctly, information on std/stis, how pregnancy worked, the complete anatomy of your  organs. think pretty much the works really.","im 22, from rural scotland. my girlfriend that i mentioned in the comment is now 21 and my sister is 18.

"oh, i'm a demon and fill the tub with straight hot water, then submerge myself. the shower isn't hot enough, because the water cools as it falls.",ugh i wouldn't trust a bath on my period. i don't care how crappy i am and how nice the water would feel. i'd rather just lay down in the empty bathtub and have hot water slowly dripping out of the shower head onto me.,"> i have virtually no  minora
i'm the same way, but for me, blood/tissue (i'm very clott-y) only comes out in the bath if my flow is heavy. on lighter flow days it doesn't unless i scoop it out. it's amazing how much variation bodies have.","if i get in the bath, blood comes out.
i guess everyone is different.
i have virtually no  minora, and you can see straight to my , so that might be part of it.",">so a girl or woman with a heavy flow would just  into the pool...
that's not what happens. when in the water, pressure and density differences keeps the fluid from leaving the body. the  is still doing it's thing though, so as soon as she leaves the pool, she will need to act fast or stain her suit. but it's not going to look like a scene from jaws. also, the amount of fluid is very small, so even if it did still flow out, it would not be noticeable in the pool. very heavy flow is like 2 fluid ounces in a day. average is about 2 ounces total (4-7 days). i mean, women take baths on their periods all the time, do you think we're just soaking in a literal blood bath? lol
edit: come on people. i'm not saying ditch your tampons for swim time. i was just correcting the other comment about bleeding in the pool. even if your flow doesn't stop in water, you're not hemorrhaging in the pool. obviously don't wear pads in the pool. obviously use tampons/cups.","if you went in the water with the pad on and then kept that same, pool water drenched pad on after swimming, it will definitely turn into an infectious, disgusting mess.
but the main issue would be that the pad would  up pool water immediately and then be ""full"", making it unable to  up the period blood, effectively making it useless. so a girl or woman with a heavy flow would just  into the pool...","yeah, wouldn't that be, like, a biohazard?",a pad is to pool as  are to wall. useless.

as i pointed out, even the correlation between hand length and foot length with height is only technically a ""weak/moderate"" correlation, but again, definitely a correlation and definitively positive.
the complexity of the human body means that even in medical studies, r values greater than 0.4 (rough guideline boundary for a weak correlation) are not seen often without gigantic sample sizes.
larger body parts are statistically found on larger bodies.
edit:
this correlation does not at all apply to men with some of the most common forms of dwarfism, where the soft tissues of the body are unaffected but bone growth is impeded in some way. these people have internal and external soft tissues roughly equal in size to those of people almost twice their height.
but go on, i'm sure you know more about this than me.",do you have a background in research or statistics? because you're absolutely talking out your .,">except a weak correlation is functionally nothing.
wrong. if that were the case, the study would have found ""no correlation."" instead, they did find one. a statistical trend.
i don't even need to read the rest of your comment.","yeah, except a weak correlation is functionally *nothing*. you can map the relationship between number of houses in tokyo and testicular torsion cases in the us and the r value will almost undoubtedly not be exactly 0. which means there's a correlation, right? except, as we know, there's no real *practical* or significant correlation. when r values are low, there's no real correlation; it's just the nature of things to produce non-zero r values if you're being precise.
now, i don't actually know the r value in this case because i can't access the full paper, but as it's weak it must be under .3. in the off chance it's like .29999, maybe it's worth having a discussion about? but i find that unlikely. and even then, weak correlation is uhh weak correlation. they designated it as such for a reason.",">weak correlation coefficients.
weak correlation is correlation. and it disproves the comment i was responding to which suggested an inverse correlation between height and  length.
the relation between human hand size and foot size is also weak/moderate, this is the best correlation which can be achieved with human proportions because of our diversity.","except that your assumption is largely wrong:
> length was found to be statistically related to both body height and foot length, but with weak correlation coefficients. height and foot size would *not* serve as practical estimators of  length.

"funny, i swear you were saying a significant positive correlation exists ie taller men statistically have larger penises. which i see you agree is false.",">a weak correlation is not a statistically significant one.

how can you expect for your friends to be a representative sample size for something like this? do you have several hundred thousand of them?
there is a weak correlation between height and  size, but obviously the spread is profound given how diverse we are. what can be said with certainty is that there definitively no inverse correlation.
>also how does everything correlate with height? i'm a woman who is 5'8 but i have tiny child sized hands (just as an example).
again, you are not a representative sample.
i was careful to say that these things are only noticeable on a statistical level, due to how individual we all are. hand size and foot size are moderately correlated with height, slightly better than  length.
as i said, people are vaguely proportional creatures.","do you have a source? because the  thing does not line up with my personal experiences or those of my friends at all.

"no offense taken! thanks for the clarification/deeper explanation. i was being a bit overly reactive to the idea that a cut is better: it definitely wasn't the whole picture, and i'm glad you spoke up.","to nuance that a bit: a cut doesn't always *have* to be bad medicine. sometimes they cut when you're neither stretching nor tearing enough to let the baby out and it becomes a problem, or when it looks like you might tear all the way to your  (3rd degree tear) they sometimes make a tiny cut a bit to the side so you tear in that direction. but yeah cutting is definitely not ideal and should only ever be a last resort.
just to prevent people panicking thinking ""omg but i was cut by my gyno who i love and trust"" when they may have had a good reason.
it also makes a lot of sense if you consider your skin is made of connected cells. cutting will go right through the cells. tearing will go between the cells. much less traumatic on your skin.

yep. honestly the cramping is the worst.","i know the healing from giving birth wasn't as painful for me (really just the stitches hurt) so you're probably right that's why it doesn't seem so bad. whereas just a ""regular period"" can be more painful too. all 3 lead to the same pain: uterine cramping.","oh yes absolutely.
yes! it's true. clots seem less painful probably because you've just given birth haha. and  yeah... i don't think they realize it's not fun to push anything out.","im speaking just about the physical pain. when you're giving birth, you're fight through the pain bc you know there's a reward at the end of it. i wanted to tap out when i got to my son's shoulders lol, but when my husband said i was almost done i was able to get through it.
i wasn't trying to compare birth pain vs miscarriage pain, just pointing out how something squishy and much smaller than a baby is still painful af. dudes think if we can push a baby out, we must be able to push out anything smaller with 0 problems lolol","oh . i feel bad for anyone who has experienced that. it would be so traumatic.
i've been fortunate, i've just pushed out two babies. i'm not being sarcastic, my kids were wanted and while it  it was nowhere near the emotional pain of a miscarriage."

she was... interesting. i also worked with my sister-in-law at the time, who felt like the april to her tynnyfer, if you've seen parks and rec:",i mean...she just skipped over cups and discs which are fine to do that with and just went straight to tampons huh? seems special lol!,"right!? she didn't like the feeling of ""wearing a diaper"" with pads, and  liners did not cover enough of her underwear for her liking, so tampons is where she landed. on top of all the ick factor, not to mention health reasons, i couldn't believe the money she was dropping on tampons by wearing one all the time. hard pass, no thanks, i'll bleed through on my surprise days if that's the solution thankyouverymuch.",never heard of pads or  liners? why would anyone put a dry  in?,i worked with a woman who did this because she was tired of surprise periods bleeding through her underwear. still makes me cringe to think of it.,the thought of daily dry tampons is more uncomfortable than i was prepared for.,"is that not how tampons work? just check it daily, and when you see red, it's time to change it? /s",when he said just check your period it immediately made me think of using a dip stick like one would check the oil in a car.
this is the kind of stuff that everyone should be learning in schools,"absolutely! i had a similar experience when i first got my period. all the pamphlets inside  boxes act like you'll die if you leave it in for more than four hours, and my mother echoed the same thing. i was terrified until i realized how rare it is! i like to compare it to serotonin syndrome- doctors, pharmacy, and any online info will warn you about taking medications together because of the risk. it's pretty  grim lol. took me awhile to learn about how rare (and treatable!) it is.
there definitely needs to be better info out there for girls so that they're not all scared shitless about dying from an exceptionally rare condition!","i do also want to just point out that tss using tampons during your period is more of a scare than anything to people using tampons and it's not as big of a threat as a lot of people feel it is.
i remember when i first started using them (and that was only when i was 18 as well mind you) my mum told me to change them every 3-4 hours urgently so i felt like if i left them in any longer i would just die. she wouldn't let me sleep with them in either because of that.
i did some more research (mama dr jones is a blessing) and i'm not nearly as worried anymore. basically if you don't just ""forget"" you're wearing one and leave it in you for days on end you'll be okay. just change it when you can or when you need to.
so now i can sleep in peace and not be afraid","oh my gosh! the most i'll do is put one in when i feel like i'm going to get my period within the next few hours, although when i'm ovulating i get so much of that sticky discharge that it feels like i'm peeing myself whenever i stand up, so i might use light tampons for a day or two. tmi, sorry lol. we've all been through it.
and sometimes people think that the only way you'll get tss is if you leave a  in for too long. that is definitely a cause, but tss can also come from inserting and taking out dry tampons frequently. because there's no blood to, uh.. lubricate it (i guess?) on the way out, it'll create tiny scratches on the vaginal walls, and bacteria can enter through those and cause tss.",i worked with a woman who did this because she was tired of surprise periods bleeding through her underwear. still makes me cringe to think of it.,the thought of daily dry tampons is more uncomfortable than i was prepared for.,"is that not how tampons work? just check it daily, and when you see red, it's time to change it? /s",when he said just check your period it immediately made me think of using a dip stick like one would check the oil in a car.
hahaha,i feel bad for those possums.,in our family the crawl space is reserved for menopausal women and possums.,you have a tent? i just go into the crawl space underneath my house and hiss at anyone who isn't a stray cat.,"when i , i just rock back and forth in fetal position in my sin tent, smacking myself on the forehead with a ping-pong paddle and muttering 'shame, shame!' - just like the men in my family taught me to do. is there another way?
edit: for those looking to buy, you can get affordable and durable sin tents at dick's sporting menstrual goods.
edit 2: thanks for the award",i just assumed it would be shameful for people to know when you have your period...,"i feel like it had something to do with knowing your fertile days. like if some dude sees your period tracker and finds out you're on a fertile day, he'd be inspired to  you because you would get pregnant or something?

"thank you, at this point i don't really care about him anymore, i hope he gets help so some other poor girl doesn't have to deal with it but also whatever he does is his life. last i heard he moved far away. the relief i felt that i wouldn't run into him was amazing. he hated being ignored so after i left he sent a few messages from burner accounts but i never even read them i just deleted them and moved on. i'm sure that drove him up a wall.","its sickening that people like this exist, very glad you got away! i hope he got or will get punished and helped out of this sick mindset better sooner than later...","yeah basically it's a ""well now we have a kid so even if you leave i'll get custody of some kind and i'll still be in your life for 18 years, you can't leave."" it goes the same way for men unfortunately, my buddies ex really really wanted him to get her pregnant so he'd feel like he had to stay with her and even if he left same .
it sucks and i can't believe that anyone would think that's the way to keep some one around.
if i had carried to term i was looking into adoption and planned to keep the kid out of that kind of life. he would have absolutely made me pay dearly for that but i couldn't bring myself to  a kid to save some bruises that would come around anyway, i was 18 with no family and isolated with him so i was in no shape at all mentally to even be a mom and that scared me as well.","wait, ""baby trap"", like he wanted to impregnate you so you'd stay with him? is that a thing? women have to put up with so much unbelievable .","i have an ex who was definitely trying to baby trap me. at the time smart phones weren't really a thing so i'd have to try and track it through other means. a lot of the time they would ""go missing"" and he made sure i didn't have access to bc. he almost got his way but my body decided otherwise which was a weird mix of emotions for me, mostly relief but then i had insane guilt over feeling so relieved to miscarry. luckily i found a way to escape that  and now my partner and i are firmly in the ""dogs are just fine for us"" category",it's honestly such a weird thing. a part of me thinks it was because he was worried of other men in my life. another part thinks he just hated periods in general and talking about them was an inconvenience. i also think he maybe wanted to baby trap me. so tracking gave me agency which was just a big no no.,"i'm seriously not understanding what this dude's deal is? he's upset you had a period tracker? does he think someone's going to see it and say, ""oh man shes firtile, well it's time to deposit my  in something firtile,"" and your going to be like ""me i'm ready,  my boyfriend! i need insemination now!"" its a weird thing to get crazy over.",i have no idea. why would that also be the thing they creep on. *i mean we have all of her personal banking details but the period tracker app is where the good stuff is*

i fully agree with you 100 percent on that,"he's such an embarrassment. we could be so proud of obama, but i can't find any redeeming quality in trump.","i'm not even american, and he offends me so much. i hope he gets found out with this russian investigation and gets impeached stripped of all assets and thrown in jail.",i'm still hoping he doesn't make it to 4 years,"oh it will happen at some point, i will live to see that day",we can dream...,the greatest ban will be the_donald,"this is the best ban in the history of bans, maybe ever"
the problem with obama is that he had a tendency to be weak. he let the republicans walk all over him way too much. he needed to stand up against the opposition. and he didn't do that enough. that's a flaw with obama - he caved in way too easily.,"he's such an embarrassment. we could be so proud of obama, but i can't find any redeeming quality in trump.","i'm not even american, and he offends me so much. i hope he gets found out with this russian investigation and gets impeached stripped of all assets and thrown in jail.",i'm still hoping he doesn't make it to 4 years,"oh it will happen at some point, i will live to see that day",we can dream...,the greatest ban will be the_donald,"this is the best ban in the history of bans, maybe ever"

ahhhh!! that makes total sense - great story!,"she had done all the testings before so she knew i wasn't pregnant. i had been there two weeks before but the comma looked like an almost two month old. she must have doubted everything in that moment. it had eyes! (not really, but the shape was perfect.)","just out of curiousity, how come the obgyn was in such shock too? like i totally get your own reaction but i dunno, i thought they always just dropped these kind of bombshells on people without really realising what it means for them, like all very matter of fact - although maybe i'm basing all of that on tv!!","i was about to get my first iud. before all the procedure of stretching that needs to be done if there wasn't a birth before she did one last ultrasound check. i saw it. like in a medicine book. that comma with the big eye bulges inside a bubble of liquid.
she said: ""that can't be!""
knowing fully well what she meant i still asked in the hopes of being wrong: ""what do you mean? what is it?""
she said: ""no, i checked, this is impossible!""
me, getting fearful: ""what? talk to me, doctor!""
she: ""you're pregnant.""
me, panicking: ""no, i'm not! can't be, must not be!""

"thank you, i appreciate that. a lot of people see monthly bills and fail to recognize that homes have an ""idle"" consumption. meaning with your fridge, clocks, and other miscellaneous appliances that have actual power draw and parasitic draw - meaning the house grounds out and consumes electricity even if nothing was plugged in, and that consumes roughly 1 - 1.75 kw/hrs non stop 24hrs a day 7 days a week.
when there are no habitats in a unit, some power companies can remotely shut off power at the junction box to reduce the parasitic draw on the grid.
that idle consumption accounts for a lot of an electric bill for most eco-conscious people.
i actually found that in my friends house, the home idled at 2.5 kw/hrs. having never paid attention to this fact their lack of awareness caused a lot of accusations to who's actions were causing the excess power bill. they've since attributed to the real cause and a lot of stress left the home.

"interesting.
now there is more to learn and to read about because my mind isnt capable of finding peace when i have questions.
if by casuality someone that knows about science, psychology, neurology or anything could come and teach us a few things about this conversation, i would be happy.","personally, i'm not asexual, but not strictly allosexual either (autistic, demisexual etc.). i used to be somewhat repulsed by genitals despite very open upbringing, no religious or moral baggage, no trauma, good education. heck, i grew up pagan with the whole feminist mother nature /phallus worship slant.
exposure in both the  sense and non- (naturist) setting alleviated that, but it's kinda ""schrodinger's neutral"" - i'm simultaneously indifferent, positive (in a theoretical appreciation way) and repulsed. i'm not -repulsed, so that allowed me positive interaction with genitals. a -repulsed asexual doesn't have that option, and even my ""training myself"" didn't fully remove the negative undercurrent. the social construct aspect is salvageable, and that would be sufficient for the majority of people, but the brain wiring isn't.","im not certain about that. i've been working in a naturist camping. people hang out completely . genitals then lose their ""sacred, , hidden, whatever"" character. i strongly believe it is a social construct.
obviously, when things get hot between persons,  get sexy, but when having a coffee, it doesnt.
where does repulsion come from ? isnt it construction we made (conscient or inconscient) through our education ? i think it is something we learn to be, not native.
>no amount of education is going to help a -repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.
you're probably right. i guess its too late for them, and learning not to be repulsed would be a hard work that i'm not sure they would want to do if they are ok like this. but i was talking before that. when we are children.
and i'm reaaaally not saying being asexual is a problem that should be cured. i have nothing to say about asexuality (or any form of sexuality or asexuality) as long as people are happy with it. my concern is only about being repulsed by body parts. concern being a big word here.","but the genitals do have a  connotation, no amount of education is going to help a -repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.","well it is just my opinion and i'm not going to force it.
i feel that any human should know the basic human anatomy, without disgust at all. we should be able to comprehend it without putting in any  aspect. but once again it is just my opinion, not backed by any science. but i feel people would be more relax about it if we could just see it as we see arms or ears. no emotions, just plain and cold.
see, im a hetero man, i have no attraction for men, but i can watch a male or female  with no disgust, and even tell people if there's something wrong like a visible skin disease, and tell them to go get checked.
but it is my way of seeing life. i'm really convinced people should know more about anatomy. we hide everything so much that it becomes like a secret, it gets mystical for some, and creates frustration, bad behaviour and so on, just because. i really feel if we would just treat organs as we do for ears, some problems would be avoided. not all, obviously, but some.
once again, only my opinion, not forcing it. i'm curious about yours, if you mind explaining. i wont tell you're wrong or im right, i would just understand other people's opinions better, and that is very good.",why would it matter if you're attracted or repulsed by them if you're not going to be near them or dictate what people should do because of what you believe.,"its ok to be asexual, but i don't find it ok to be repulsed by human body parts. if you remove , there still is basic biology, anatomy, plain and cold.",people gotta learn that it's okay to be asexual.

"yes, it was the special cocktail of the night.
actual answer: my now ex husband used a jar to empty the turtle tank and left it half full in the kitchen. i came home thirsty from the madrid heat and only realised the strange taste after i had drank the whole thing. my ex's aunt was also having a heart transplant at the time so we were both too stressed for common sense.
(transplant went well, i didn't get salmonella, aunt is fine 13 years later, ex and i divorced but are still best friends and friends with our respective new partners, happy endings all around)",".........sooo which part was accidental? drinking the tank water, or drinking it the day before? like, was that supposed to be reserved for the main event?"," food is always a terrible idea, but i accidentally drank turtle tank water the day before my wedding so salmonella doesn't scare me.","well yes, obviously, i was just picturing  salmonella",...literally everything in my post...,">stuff chicken livers inside and whatnot
today on terrible ideas:","not the culture i know that does virginity checks, because i'm that one they are carried out by women...
edit to expand: in spanish roma culture you can either have a wedding or an ""arrejuntamiento"" (joining). a wedding brings more honor to the bride's family, and it includes the ritual of roses, where a designated elderly woman will stick a white handkerchief in the bride's  until the  tears a bit so they can show the ""roses"".
although the joining is also acceptable for many families, it's going to depend on how tradicional the patriarch is so there is some trickery about it. it's sometimes possible to bribe the  checker so she'll  her own finger, stuff chicken livers inside and whatnot.
there are also (although thankfully not common) bride kidnappings which is  up. some years ago the family of a kid in the high school where my mom works kidnapped the girl he had a crush on to force her to marry him. it's a very hermetic community so it never transcended if she was  or not or what consequences were brought upon the kidnappers family; as far as the school staff knows the police were brought only to report the girl missing and once she appeared they were asked to let it drop. thankfully the girl's family was not traditional so they did not force her to marry the boy.",what culture is it?

"see that wouldn't weird me out as much. it's your parent sharing something about their health with you. i'd argue it's a good thing to slip into a conversation about  health & how to take care of yourself, the need to get checked etc.
of course there's a time and a place and a way to bring it up and it also depends on how open your conversations normally are. in my family we talk about anatomy,  health, pregnancy etc pretty openly. what i do not need to know about my older family members, however, is how many partners they have and what's the exact nature of each relationship, what their kinks are, etc. but as a generic topic, i'm al for normalizing the fact that  is being had and that sti's are a thing.","i remember when my mum told me she had genital warts. like there's a time and a place for it, and honestly? telling your kids or even family  like that is never the time nor place","eeew no please keep on never sharing that stuff with a family member from a younger generation.

"**[body hair]( publishing in the british,have the most body hair)**
>body hair, or androgenic hair, is the terminal hair that develops on the human body during and after puberty. it is differentiated from the head hair and less visible vellus hair, which is much finer and lighter in color. the growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of androgens (often referred to as male hormones) and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.

the least hairy ethnicities, according to some googling, are asians and native americans. combined, these groups make up around 60% of the global population. we can assume that the majority of these women have less leg hair than this woman does. just going off of that alone shows use that the majority of women have less leg hair than this woman does.
but if we add in some other factors, there's more evidence. body hair starts to decline around 50 in most people, due to hormonal changes. this woman is young, probably at peak hairy years. a significant portion of the population is older than 50, around 35%. we can assume that most of those women have less leg hair than this woman.","the majority of women shave their legs because it's socially required, so i'm not sure how you would know.","for sure

"that's why i added the generalizations with ethnicity. idk why i'm getting downvoted here, i never made any judgements about body hair. saying that this is an above average amount is not an insult. some people have extra thick head hair too. some women grow full beards, and most only have light  hair or fuzz.","honestly i have no idea if you're right or wrong about this (my leg hair is pale and fine but not exactly sparse so it might look this way if it were darker but either way i'm just one data point) but i have to imagine that the women you know who are comfortable with not shaving having sparser/finer leg hair than this is not entirely a coincidence.
that is, if you're this hairy as a woman, you'd probably get a lot of comments and feel more pressure to remove or cover up the hair. so if most of the upper end of this curve is just fully removed, then the only 'natural' leg hair you end up seeing is relatively non-noticable, giving the impression that most women, if they let their hair grow out, will have relatively non-noticable hair too.

growing increased amounts of body hair while in a cast or similar device is a common occurrence. this is probably an unusual amount of leg hair even for this woman. normally, friction from clothes and washing and daily activities rubs off some of the hair and skin cells. when a limb is protected like this that doesn't happen as much and people grow more hair for a while.
and aside from that, this woman calls herself a ""hairy girl"" and makes tons of videos capitalizing on it because she grows more body hair than most women and people find it interesting. it's her whole tiktok channel. acknowledging that she is hairier than average is not an insult, it's literally just a fact that she herself has embraced.",? the post is about men thinking she's required to shave or that there's something inherently wrong with not shaving.,"because it's an interesting discussion? it's what everyone in this thread is talking about, and what the video is about to an extent. i don't see why it's bothering people to mention it.",why does it matter? why do you need to clarify that she has more leg hair than most women? what purpose does it serve?,"for sure

that study does not support your statements about men's preferences. in that study, 36% of men were neutral about genital appearance. they don't give the percentage of men who preferred smaller , just that more preferred smaller  than larger . this does not mean that **most** men prefer smaller --after all, if 36% of men were neutral, that only leaves 64% of men that have a preference in either direction. the makeup of how many of those men preferred smaller to larger is not specified there (it could be 34% smaller to 30% larger, for example--leaving most men without a preference) nor is the strength of the preferences listed (strong preference versus mild).

definitely gonna check out that article and look up the disorder. i really appreciate you sharing that information. my gyn handles my contraceptives, but she and my psychiatrist would probably both want to know and discuss the possibility if i suspect anything following my reading. i wouldn't be surprised if i have it considering my litany of other health problems which all revolve around abnormal hormone and neurotransmitter levels. i'm actually on an ssri and used to be able to raise my dosage slightly around my tom to help control the psychiatric symptoms i get or have worse around that time, but unfortunately i can't anymore because of a high risk of delayed-onset serotonin syndrome, which can be very dangerous if allowed to persist.
i'm actually 29 right now which is why i have so much uncertainty around whether or not i want to have children. -shrugs- i'm also very wary of getting something inserted under my skin. i'd probably have an anxiety attack or faint during the procedure. so i don't want to commit to that until i'm sure just to avoid the emotional stress.

and just a side note regarding ""more potent birth control"", the implant is particularly good because your cycle returns to normal within a month of the implant being removed. it's not more potent, just longer lasting for ease. it's also more expensive because it's longer lasting. in the uk they won't put a woman on the implant if she has any intention of getting pregnant in the next 3 years because it's a waste of nhs money to remove it again when shorter term methods are available. if you have really good private health insurance, i imagine this wouldn't be a problem. also, birth control isn't measured in potency - consistent pill usage, iud and implants all have the same ""potency"" in terms of you not getting pregnant (within 1-2%). the only issue is non reversible methods - injection rather than implant or pill, for example. you can't take an injection out or stop taking it, you have to wait the 3 months until it's warn off.
if you definitely don't want to have a child in the next 3 years, get the implant. it doesn't impact your long term fertility levels or anything like that. and if for some reason you don't like it/it causes side effects/you suddenly decided you want to have a baby right now, you can just have it removed and be good to go in 4 weeks.
thank you for the good wishes! when i was 28-33ish and every single person i knew was having children, it was awful. i'd sob in the bath after each pregnancy announcement, despite being beyond happy for my friends. my partner and i are nearing 40 now and we love having lots of little people in our lives that we can enjoy spending time with - and then give back!!",". the way most people would react to me/treated me during & around my periods before i went onto the 3-month cycle of contraceptives, i always was under the impression that my severe instability and hyperarousal (refering to emotional state, not horniness ) was me being ""hysterical"", at least until i looked into it myself and realize that everyone else was just being an  because clearly if you're the only one *obviously* going mental because of ""normal"" hormone fluctuations, you must be a hypochrondriac or attention , right?
i'm glad your aunt got relief from her -triggered psychosis when she went on contraceptives and then finally when she hit menopause. it's insane what our bodies do to us. it really is. i agree wholeheartedly that periods .
i haven't decided yet if i want to try to have kids. i do know that if i do, i'll definitely go on a more potent form of contraceptive than the pill i am currently on after one or two and that will be the end of it. i sometimes wonder of i'm even fertile, though. i have a feeling conceiving may prove difficult if i decided to try.
i'm sorry that you are unable to have children, but i'm also glad that at this point it's also no longer an problem to you!","that sounds  awful for you. i'm so sorry you have to deal with that - but i'm really glad you had a doctor that listened and now you (only) have to suffer that 4 times a year. it's still too much, but better than nothing.

i've been on contraception for almost as long as i've been menstruating (very late puberty) and i sometimes wonder how different my body would feel without bc. but not for too long. periods . i can't have children, and although it's taken a while, i'm now happy not to have them (i'm nearing 40) so why should i have to put up with painful, inconvenient, costly periods when they can safely be stopped?!","my gyn actually agreed to switch me to a 3-month cycle about 5 or so years back after discussing it with her. my quality of life goes to  whenever i have a period, so reducing it to 4 times a year was a massive boon to me. don't need to worry about the sensations of menstruating and feeling or smelling my own  making me feel psychotic and angry or deal with severe , heavy bleeding or cramping anymore since even the 4x a year are usually so light as to not even care now.
if your doctor is reasonable and there's no barriers to getting treatment (such as health insurance approval) to worry about, your doctor will give you what you need to improve the quality of your life. if they refuse without a valid explanation, get a new doctor. there's no real biological need to have a period once a month - or at all, really - if you aren't trying to get pregnant.

there is absolutely no reason for there to be any tearing pain or bleeding during first inter course. no more than any other time someone has . it takes time, communication, emotional and physical comfort, and arousal and ther will be no pain (unless the person is an anomaly and has a condition that causes pain during ).

"nah. it's not normal that when i was in high school and most of my friends were having  for the first time. we would sit and talk and every girls story was the same. that it hurt so bad they were crying and got blood on the sheets. every girl saying it was horrible, they were so scared, it hurt so bad. every single one of us was under the impression that it hurt the first time you had  for an anatomical reason. that that was normal and was related to the  myth.
it doesn't need to hurt the first time you have  and it only does if the man isn't making sure that their partner is aroused and ready before they stick it in. why do men get to universally enjoy their first time but for woman it's ok that it's painful even when there's no reason it has to be besides the guy couldn't wait to get his  wet and/or both parties didn't know that if they just waited and worked up to it more the girl would relax and get wetter and it wouldn't hurt.
the first time i had  i said it was hurting so m partner stopped and went back to  me more and went down on me and then we tried again and it didn't hurt anymore. that could have been the story of every one of my friends too instead of a bloody horror story if they had known that what they went through wasn't necessary, wasn't related to anatomy or their , and shouldn't be  normal.
it shouldn't be normal or expected for women to have pain and bleeding the first time they have . that's  barbaric. like sorry no one told you and you had to go through that but it doesn't mean generations more of women and girls do. idk why you would want to perpetuate the idea that it's normal just so you can feel ok about your first time at the expense of every other girls coming after you. like i'm truly sorry to you that you had to go through that and didn't have a partner who said oh if it hurts then i want to stop and let's make you more comfortable or aroused. sorry you didn't get to enjoy your first time without pain.
you are bending over backwards to try to explain why it's ok for women to have their first time be painful and bloody. none of that matter when it's a completely addressable issue. and you're arguing against providing women the information they need to know to address it just bc ur  randomly bleeds sometimes like jesus get so perspective. so what. none of the  you said changes the fact that women bleeding and experiencing pain the first time they have  can be solved by just slowing down and helping the girl get more comfortable. which is also great bc if she's physically uncomfortable like that she's probably mentally u comfortable to. and will enjoy herself way more of she's able to relax. sorry i want women to enjoy their first time.
but just because you had to go through something  trying to normalize it so that other people have to go through it too is a really  up thing to do. you're literally saying that i'm shaming you by saying that women shouldn't experience pain and bleeding the first time they have . this has nothing to do about anything but your own selfishness and needing to justify your own experience even if it means hurting other people. ok got it.","it's completely normal. a lot of people don't really know their bodies at that point and don't really know how important foreplay is so they just go for it without making sure there's proper lubrication and so on. it's not ideal, but it's certainly *normal.*
in a perfect world we'd have people be super careful and prepared every time we have , but that's not a thing that exists, lol. it's completely normal to tear. i think you need to look up the word ""normal."" , i'm 34 and sometimes i jump into a quickie too fast before i'm fully prepared and even i'll tear. it's normal and i'm fine with it, lol. inexperienced people get just as impatient as experienced people do sometimes, and *that's completely normal.* you're sort of living in a delusional world where you seem to think  should exist within a utopian vacuum where everything is always prepared and perfect and innately knowledgeable and that's simply not practical.
is it avoidable? yes, sure. are people always actually going to do what they need to avoid it? no. losing my virginity personally didn't hurt at all because i was suuuuuper ""ready"" for it, but since then there have been times  does hurt because like i said, quickies or whatever.
i totally agree it shouldn't be normalized and it's barbaric that there are still cultures where a girl/woman has to prove she's a  by bleeding on the sheets on her wedding night, but that's not even what i'm talking about here. just in general it happens, and (i cannot stress this enough) *it's normal.* just as *it's normal* to not bleed or tear the first time. people need to stop seeing this in black and white.
and your little edit at the end to ""girls"" is way overarching. sometimes i get random bleeding from my  after particularly rambunctious  and that's normal for some women, at least according to every gynecologist i've ever spoken to. some of us do that when we get jostled. stuff happens. as i stated,  doesn't exist in some utopian vacuum.
any ""this is how  should be"" statement is going to shame someone and it's just as harmful language as the idea that women should bleed and tear losing their virginity if they're actually virgins.","no! tearing during first inter course isn't normal at all. thats the whole reason were bring up how this concept of breaking the  is harmful. thanks for proving my point.
there is absolutely no reason for there to be any tearing pain or bleeding during first inter course. no more than any other time someone has . it takes time, communication, emotional and physical comfort, and arousal and ther will be no pain (unless the person is an anomaly and has a condition that causes pain during ).
if there is pain during a persons first time then they have not taken the time to establish the above factors so the woman is not ready. she needs more lubrication and her muscles to relax more.

"if you can touch your taint, you would probably have the flexibility to put in a cup! so some people may be unable to do it, but in general people can reach the necessary parts.
the position people use to get it in can vary. i prefer sitting on the toilet and sorta reaching into the bowl. another common one is standing with one leg propped up at a 90 degree angle (ie one foot on the edge of a tub, chair, toilet, etc). you generally want things a little spread out, just standing normally won't cut it, but you don't need any extreme positions, thankfully. the same is true of putting in tampons!",">no need to be flexible to wear a cup.

and this",what is your problem?,"can we stay on topic? i'm trying to understand why you think that the ai is ""sexist"" and racist because the **programmers are men**. and not because the data sets which were used to train the ai might have created a bias or because the people who are using the ai have a bias, no, you specifically targeted the **programmers**","you really like taking huge leaps to justify taking offence.
[]()","are you now implying that men are racist?
do you really think that because a man programmed the ai that that's why it starts spitting giant-boobed women? in this case specifically it was probably because it's exactly what the user who was using the ai told it to generate.","yes. i'm not saying there are no women programmers! but this it sketch af.
it's also why most ai systems also struggle to acknowledge the existence of people who are not white."

everything you've described is normal-- it takes time to get used to it in you. you'll have to get used to being up close and personal with yourself as well. took me a few weeks of practice to get the hang of it's definitely easier when you're already bleeding as the blood makes it easier to slide in. not sure what fold you're describing but that takes a bit to see what works best for you-- personally i just tuck the top bit down so it makes a bit of a point.
try inserting while sitting on the toilet -- sometimes the angle is easier. i am hairy too so it could be your hair or your skin just may be sensitive there. always remember to have clean hands when you insert/remove!
personally i always check to see if it's opened by wiping a bit-- you'll still get blood initially but if you're still bleeding pretty freely a few min later you may not be opened. that takes a while to get used to also-- the way i fold it it always pops open once it's in. you may have to experiment with how far up you put it, etc-- personally when the nubbin is hanging out it's sitting too low for me, i like my skin to be able to close around it while i go about my day.
it all takes practice bit trust me having a cup will change your life! when removing it it helps to reach up and make a divet in it to break the seal, or else it'll be too hard to remove. your body is very responsive to anxiety so if you have trouble inserting/removing just have a break and try again later. remember it can't ever get lost in you either, and it'll sit lower in your canal as it gets heavier with blood.
good luck! hope that helps"
thank you for the information!!,"they would be just as sanitary as a sanitation napkin/pad would be, probably more so. i change them as frequently as i would a pad anyways, especially on the heavier days. as another person stated, there is a lot of ignorance when it comes to the female body and reproductive system.

"well i haven't done the butt-grab test, but i didn't mean in a diaper-y way. compared to regular underwear, they're bulkier, though that is to be expected.","i think the ""bulk"" depends on the absorbency level and the wearer. i have heavier absorbency ones that i wear at bed, and use the light or moderate during the day. i have never felt that they were bulky or noticeable at all. i asked my husband if it looked like i was wearing a diaper, and he had no idea what i was talking about. he then grabbed my butt and said he wouldn't have noticed if i hadn't said anything :)","i use thinx as well, and never had a mishap with them. i usually use it as a backup on the first few days and night time wear. they're a little bulky imo, but i am a heavy bleeder and would take discomfort over bleeding through my clothes.","i'm in the us and use thinx brand. my , they are amazing. they have options for different flows, and some cute ones. i also got bike shorts. during my period, i like having my underwear/pants/whatever tight around my waist, and am excited to try those for night time.

thank you for that i need to subscribe to her. i always forget to,"you are very welcome! the ""momma doctor jones"" youtube channel is packed full of important and useful information regarding us females. she is an obgyn, and she goes over everything from periods and birth control, to the different ways of having babies. and then there's her running ""reaction"" videos of the tv show ""i didn't know i was pregnant"" which is so stinking hilarious!",thank you so very much.,"if you're in the us, the thinx brand is really good. if you're in canada, i'm pretty certain they ship there as well. i haven't had to worry about that stuff in about 10 years, so i personally never tried them as they weren't prevalent on the market yet. that being said, i have a friend, and my eldest daughter that uses them. my friend is on the heavier side of things, and she loves them, at night especially. she doesn't leak past the front or back of the over night pads anymore, because they couldn't ""reach perfectly"" to both front and back. my 16 yr old daughter uses them mostly after she is home from school and on weekends and overnights. she prefers them to pads on her underwear, even the ""ultra thin"" ones. we have discovered she has a sensitivity to something in multiple brands of pads, and is flat out allergic to the scented ones. (i accidently bought them one month, and she said she would try them. that ended badly.) her skin in that area is a lot happier as well.
there is another option you can do as well. i know for sure they're made on etsy. it resembles a pair of regular , or the thinx, but it has removable, reusable inserts that vary is size based on flow i believe. i saw them also on ""momma doctor jones"" video talking about what the different things are for menstrual cycles. when it's full, and it's time to change it, if you're out and about, you can carry a roll of baggies, like people have for if their dog poops, and use one of those for the liner. when you get home, you rinse in cold water, and put into laundry to wash it. (i learned the doggy bag trick when i was doing cloth diapers.)

">i don't get it, why won't they do some housekeeping?
cowardice and apathy is why. to the average lefty, someone else pumping a toddler full of drugs doesn't affect their lives, so they don't care enough to do or say anything about it. and those that *do* speak out are exiled from the ideological tribe.
dr. jordan b. peterson and bret weinstein were originally libcenters, who by speaking out against the left-wing extremists, were exiled from the tribe. the right-wing then promptly offered them a welcoming home, where ideological disagreements are plentiful, but rarely rising to the level of resulting in excommunication.
if the left doesn't want to be associated with these child abusing monsters, then they need to accept their exile collectively and move to greener pastures, like what dave rubin did.","i don't get it, why won't they do some housekeeping?

kind of throws off your whole initial claim about big pharma and doctors being in on this. they just gave their kid a boys haircut.",,">deciding to transition toddlers to opposite gender
i'm not saying that isn't happening, but i can't seem to find anything referencing something like that. source?",no no i'm sounding exactly as i should be... some woke parents and doctors are now deciding to transition toddlers to opposite gender just because some boy liked dressing like girl ... it's very common if u read news.. i think everyone should have rights to do whatever to their body once they reach legal age but experimenting with bodies of children is evil..,you sound deranged.,problem is these leftist are now deciding what a 4yrs old kids (who have no idea what there rights are.. because u guessed it they are kids!!) gender will be ...and they have been treated as lab rats run by big pharma who want to sell as many hormone changing drugs as they can... even more than prozac ..,"children are such little ...  kids
wait, no! no, no, no! purple, that's not what i meant!"
just give him a moment he's just a touch ,then why do you type like you are high?,no i'm not lib left who just keep himself high and. does no work... i have to work and earn money so i don't get high during week days,"yes, but you are high.",high on what?? i'm stating facts what i have seen with my eyes,you are high.,problem is these leftist are now deciding what a 4yrs old kids (who have no idea what there rights are.. because u guessed it they are kids!!) gender will be ...and they have been treated as lab rats run by big pharma who want to sell as many hormone changing drugs as they can... even more than prozac ..,"children are such little ...  kids

gender dysphoria is same level that of ocd ptsd and adhd according to me.. and i'm pretty sure they don't require syrgeries or people around those affected to act accordingly to there wishes,"can you even  hear yourself?
that's not a thing anyone is doing. you know trans people are real right? and you know that trans people, just like  and straight people are that way from birth right?
so... you don't think kids can be trans?
i just linked a study that shows 94% of kids over the age of 5 that self identify as trans will remain so. of those that change their minds most of them turn enbys, and those that turn cis do so before the age of 10.",grooming them till age 15 to perform surgeries.. yeah ok good work,"at least you admit that is all we are talking about.
nobody is performing surgery on little kids, or forcing anyone to transition at 3 years old.",so removing healthy breast of 15 yrs old is fine?? u r a  ain't u??,"if you're talking about mastectomies, they are very few instances of that being given to anyone under 18, and in these cases we are typically talking about 15 year olds.",what other option will they have other than stay what they become?? u can't grow breast removed from healthy girls back.. can u?? all these data baffles me and other sane minded individuals who like children to first grow the  up before removing body parts ..,"also known as treating trans kids properly, when the kid, parents and doctors all agree.

"""one would assume high schoolers"". based on what? is there any scientific data to support this assumption?","periods are getting earlier and earlier, that's true, but we're talking about teenagers, and one would assume high schoolers, as that's where the most the popular media focuses on underage/teen pregnancies.
humans absolutely had shorter lifespans, and until not that long ago. you can't simultaneously say that malnutrition/low calorie diets, poor hygiene, poor medicine (a lot of the reasons you said are redundant or irrelevant, so i'm adding some), etc are relevant to age of puberty and birth rate, but not to longevity. there wasn't a proliferation of seniors until very, very recently in human history. the fossil record shows 30 year olds from a thousand years ago with the kind of illness indicators and deterioration you'd expect to see in someone twice that age today.
it's also interesting that you can go to parts of the world where young girls get married off as teenagers and start bearing children as soon as they are able, and see that those children have outcomes more dependent on social/environmental factors than biological. the kid who's mother is can't afford to feed him appropriately is not going to do as well as the kid who's mother can provide excess calories.","your comment is just factually incorrect. poor nutrition, low calorie diet, physically strenuous lifestyles in prehistoric times, meant that there was a later onset of periods. periods at 13 are an absolutely unnatural and modern phenomenon. (unnatural in the historical perspective)
also, humans didn't have a shorter lifespan, the average lifespan is brought down by the high number of infant and maternal mortality rates. ironically, childbirth was quite deadly. given that info, it's logical to assume that all the people in the prehistoric tribes would have been very protective of younger women's  experiences.

if you assert that fascism is socialist because the ""government"" owned the economy, then by the same logic, feudalism and monarchism are both ""socialism"" too.

"> this is not true, measures for depression such as beck's depression inventory are highly validated with chronbach's alpha's of over .8 in some instances. there is no such measure for gender dysphoria.
weird because the link you posted below mentions:
> (63.3%) of the boys met the dsm-iii, iii-r, or iv criteria for gender identity disorder;
which is a pretty comprehensive criteria for identifiying gid
and as for that actually study, yeah that looks pretty solid, but a few points i should mention
12% were noted as persisters, that is not ""so low that effectively there are no trans children.""
and the study itself gives a lot of extra details about that number.
> in steensma et al. (51), the dsm-iv-tr criteria were used. of the 23 persisters, 21 (91.3%) met the criteria for gid; in contrast, only 22 (39.3%) of the 56 desisters were threshold for the diagnosis, suggesting an even more substantial difference in the threshold-subthreshold distinction than was found in wallien and cohen-kettenis
so when a stricter criteria is used so that less kids are considered ""sub threshold"" then that number goes up dramatically.

">
this references studies that were done before the diagnosis of gender dysphoria even existed.
at the time, they used gender identity disorder, which wasn't just a different name for the same disorder, it had notably more relaxed diagnostic criteria. it was considered a behavioral disorder, which could be met simply through gender nonconformity. in fact, these studies and their findings are referenced as guiding factors for the diagnostic criteria change that came with introducing gender dysphoria in the dsm-v.
additionally, even with that more relaxed criteria, many children still did not meet the criteria. 30%-40% of kids (depending on the study) did not meet criteria for a diagnosis. meaning there was nothing to persist from in the first place. yet they were included in these ""desistance"" rates.
another limitation is the timeframe of these diagnoses, because they'd be done once at an average age of 7 then again after puberty.
that is not relevant to modern medical diagnosis. kids are evaluated up to tanner stage 2 of puberty and only then if they've exhibited persistent gender dysphoria are they even eligible for any kind of medical intervention.
so even if some portion do genuinely desist, the implication that it's puberty that causes it rather than them desisting prior to puberty is pure conjecture.
> leuprolide acetate is a common puberty blocker which is used to chemically castrate people
while they're taking it... there are precisely 0 people who've been made permanently infertile solely through the use of  hormone blockers. the effect is active only when on the medication. that's why the term ""reversible"" is used. because there's no scenario where discontinuing usage of blockers has resulted in infertility.",">the same is true for any psychological condition. but you wouldnt try to claim their are not depressed children.

"just a few things
1. turkey has a very low english fluency rate, at about 16%, saying they all speak good english is a massive exaggeration, and is probably limited to the main large cities.
2. i didn't say bad english = bad  ed, but that it can be correlated to worse or more conservative education, such as highly religious countries or ethnostates where they choose to limit the teaching of the female body and foreign languages. my point was that these places with lower english fluency rates on average have very limited knowledge or teaching on female anatomy as well, as such, very bad english is commonly hand in hand with very bad knowledge of the female body. of course there are also groups in the us that weren't taught that either, but that is usually, once again, in the more conservative states.
3. the us is a mixing , as such we don't have any official languages, it's just that english is the most commonly known and spoken, therefore it is taught and learned as a first language, but it is still very common for other languages, like spanish and german, to be learned and taught as well, since we have a large hispanic population and many german cities that grew from early settlers.","i know quite a lot of turks, and they all speak pretty good english. as for lack of  ed, you can find that very easily in the us, where english is the official language (though tbh you can equally bad english grammar among native us english speakers if the internet is anything to go by). this person is clearly not a native english speaker, but that doesn't directly correlate with having no clue how the female body works. this person most likely comes from a country with worse  ed, but not everyone with bad english necessarily is.","many countries that have strict or ridiculous laws or religious rules against women and teaching knowledge of women commonly don't have secondary languages, like english, in the curriculum. as such, poor english capabilities is usually assumed that these people come from a country with little to no education on anatomy or  education as well, like highly conservative religious states or corrupt tyrannical governments that either are too poor or corrupt to fund education, are too religious and anti-women to teach about anatomy and , or choose not to educate their citizens. like how in places like turkey and belarus, which are very religious and conservative countries, blatantly refuse to teach anything relating to women's bodies, and many men their only have ridiculously preconceived notions about women and , saying things similar to the original post when interviewed, as well as how they would  their female relatives or significant other if they got a job or exhibited one of their poorly educated myths on biology. the justification they give for those murders is, ""to protect my honor, our tradition, and punish her for going against god""",why does the writers' english lavel have anything to do with their bizarre beliefs?,"ohh, okay, well that explains all the other ridiculous  ""clues!""",their native language is likely not english...,"in the last one, i can't tell if he is talking about the guy being a  or the girl.

exactly.,"just some small off topic pedantry, the us doesn't have an official language. but i agree with your comment, it's odd that people would assume non english equals bad  ed, seeing as there are non english speaking, developed countries with better  education than the us. a quick google seems to say the netherlands have the best  education (kind of hard to measure something like that but it seems to be the consensus), and none of the next few runners up on any of the sources i clicked through were english speaking.","i know quite a lot of turks, and they all speak pretty good english. as for lack of  ed, you can find that very easily in the us, where english is the official language (though tbh you can equally bad english grammar among native us english speakers if the internet is anything to go by). this person is clearly not a native english speaker, but that doesn't directly correlate with having no clue how the female body works. this person most likely comes from a country with worse  ed, but not everyone with bad english necessarily is.","many countries that have strict or ridiculous laws or religious rules against women and teaching knowledge of women commonly don't have secondary languages, like english, in the curriculum. as such, poor english capabilities is usually assumed that these people come from a country with little to no education on anatomy or  education as well, like highly conservative religious states or corrupt tyrannical governments that either are too poor or corrupt to fund education, are too religious and anti-women to teach about anatomy and , or choose not to educate their citizens. like how in places like turkey and belarus, which are very religious and conservative countries, blatantly refuse to teach anything relating to women's bodies, and many men their only have ridiculously preconceived notions about women and , saying things similar to the original post when interviewed, as well as how they would  their female relatives or significant other if they got a job or exhibited one of their poorly educated myths on biology. the justification they give for those murders is, ""to protect my honor, our tradition, and punish her for going against god""",why does the writers' english lavel have anything to do with their bizarre beliefs?,"ohh, okay, well that explains all the other ridiculous  ""clues!""",their native language is likely not english...,"in the last one, i can't tell if he is talking about the guy being a  or the girl.

took a few more years to realise that cis people also usually feel gender as an innate feeling inside them, and that *not feeling like you have a gender* is an innately trans experience.

now i know what it is. thanks!",well according to google (i am no doctor!) a bunion occurs when the bone in your big toe moves out of place. so it would make sense for ballet dancers and strippers who wore heels for hours. one of the causes mentioned for bunions are shoes that are too narrow so pointed heels and ballerina slippers would make sense.,"that's what my foot does!! i was told that is a bunion. i said ""no, my foot is misshapen now"" but the person said, ""yeah, that's what a bunion is.""

i was a stripper for about 5 years. so 8 to 10 hours of wearing heels ever night while dancing. my feet had a distinctly different shape after. it has lessened since i haven't danced/worn heels in so long. i also thought people who do toe point ballet will have foot shape change.","i have flat feet, so maybe? they're not longer, just wider. but the bunion on my right foot doesn't hurt anymore!
another myth, op, is that high heels cause bunions. nope, just genetics.",wait... is that a thing?,same. but my feet! i've gone shoeless for the pandemic (as well as braless) and my feet are definitely bigger now.

ballerina feet are messed up. they wind up with misshapen bones on the top of the foot. like the foot arches *all* the way. presumably that's because they're dancing while they're still growing.

i've had them since late teens. a school mate had noticeable bunions since grade 8.,"yeah, basically a bunion is when the bone of the big toe starts sliding out. my mom's toe is at like a 45 degree angle. maybe more. she never wore heels!
ballerina feet are messed up. they wind up with misshapen bones on the top of the foot. like the foot arches *all* the way. presumably that's because they're dancing while they're still growing.

"if you do go with an iud, go with a different provider. you want someone who takes your pain and concerns seriously, and who will take the time to discuss the pros and cons of different pain management options for it. full sedation isn't really doable for an in-office procedure but it's definitely not pap smear level pain, either.",yes that response really turned me off from deciding on it. i know people personally who've said how bad it was and they are mother's so i trust their pain threshold. i know it could go relatively well but i also know it could not and her acting like she knew a.) my pain threshold and b.) that i wouldn't have any complications really annoyed me. i've just been researching uid personal experiences but i guess i should be looking into more options as well.,no. it is not relative to a pap smear. that's a sketchy thing to say.,"these are very interesting responses. i'm also at the point with my husband where we are discussing a vasectomy, we live in america, but just like i'm nervous he obviously is too. fun times, i will for sure ask about non hormonal birth control. i asked pretty thoroughly about the pain and she told me it was close to a pap smear and i'd be fine, which i know is not the case.",if doctor is not offering you significant pain management tell doctor to get . and i'm saying that as someone who has best case scenario experiences with an iud.,not op but my dr is telling me i need to get off birth control due to my age in a few years and is pushing an iud since i don't ever want kids. i'm such a baby i make my husband tell me jokes to get my covid vaccine. last time someone tried to take my blood i actually scared them into giving up...,"also if reading articels of people getting an iud inserted is already giving you anxiety, maybe it is just not the right thing for you. there are other hormonal methods avaliable, with pain free applicating, like nuva ring, birth control pill, etc. or is there a specific reason only an iud is an option for you?","i have a copper iud (not an hormonal iud) but i think the insertion process is basically the same. my insertion was definitly painful (like a really bad period cramp), but the strong pain is really quickly over. not even a minute, as i remember it. for the rest of the day i had light to medium cramps similar to the start of my period, so i recommend not planning to do anything for the rest the day of the insertion.
for me personally that amount of pain is totally worth it for 5 years of very save but hormone-free contraception. but notice that i am not generally anxious about painfull medical procedures. i don't enjoy them for sure, but i don't feel fear or anxiety before it, so maybe this does not apply to you. also i have had bad period pain for years, so i am kinda used to this kind of pain."
sorry i don't know why i read finding nemo but thought shrek. my bad. i fixed it.,"finding nemo doesn't originate in spanish-speaking culture, and i said nothing about shrek?","shakira and those others (except finding nemo) originate in the actual cultures you study in spanish, and class should be fun, so that makes sense. wap and ben shapiro aren't german in origin, so that's why i asked.","watching/discussing recent pop culture topics helps develop familiarity with the language. i watched finding nemo in high school spanish class for this reason. and in college we watched the shakira and alejandro sanz video, la tortura, to compare how their accents differ due to being from different countries, and how they pronounce similar words slightly differently. allegedly, anyway. i can't say how many members of the class were actually doing that versus just enjoying the view.",my question remains,just happened in my german class,how is any of this german-related?,"hahahah welp just got that kind of teacher igggg

"interesting.
now there is more to learn and to read about because my mind isnt capable of finding peace when i have questions.
if by casuality someone that knows about science, psychology, neurology or anything could come and teach us a few things about this conversation, i would be happy.","personally, i'm not asexual, but not strictly allosexual either (autistic, demisexual etc.). i used to be somewhat repulsed by genitals despite very open upbringing, no religious or moral baggage, no trauma, good education. heck, i grew up pagan with the whole feminist mother nature /phallus worship slant.
exposure in both the  sense and non- (naturist) setting alleviated that, but it's kinda ""schrodinger's neutral"" - i'm simultaneously indifferent, positive (in a theoretical appreciation way) and repulsed. i'm not -repulsed, so that allowed me positive interaction with genitals. a -repulsed asexual doesn't have that option, and even my ""training myself"" didn't fully remove the negative undercurrent. the social construct aspect is salvageable, and that would be sufficient for the majority of people, but the brain wiring isn't.","im not certain about that. i've been working in a naturist camping. people hang out completely . genitals then lose their ""sacred, , hidden, whatever"" character. i strongly believe it is a social construct.
obviously, when things get hot between persons,  get sexy, but when having a coffee, it doesnt.
where does repulsion come from ? isnt it construction we made (conscient or inconscient) through our education ? i think it is something we learn to be, not native.
>no amount of education is going to help a -repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.
you're probably right. i guess its too late for them, and learning not to be repulsed would be a hard work that i'm not sure they would want to do if they are ok like this. but i was talking before that. when we are children.
and i'm reaaaally not saying being asexual is a problem that should be cured. i have nothing to say about asexuality (or any form of sexuality or asexuality) as long as people are happy with it. my concern is only about being repulsed by body parts. concern being a big word here.","but the genitals do have a  connotation, no amount of education is going to help a -repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.","well it is just my opinion and i'm not going to force it.
i feel that any human should know the basic human anatomy, without disgust at all. we should be able to comprehend it without putting in any  aspect. but once again it is just my opinion, not backed by any science. but i feel people would be more relax about it if we could just see it as we see arms or ears. no emotions, just plain and cold.
see, im a hetero man, i have no attraction for men, but i can watch a male or female  with no disgust, and even tell people if there's something wrong like a visible skin disease, and tell them to go get checked.
but it is my way of seeing life. i'm really convinced people should know more about anatomy. we hide everything so much that it becomes like a secret, it gets mystical for some, and creates frustration, bad behaviour and so on, just because. i really feel if we would just treat organs as we do for ears, some problems would be avoided. not all, obviously, but some.
once again, only my opinion, not forcing it. i'm curious about yours, if you mind explaining. i wont tell you're wrong or im right, i would just understand other people's opinions better, and that is very good.",why would it matter if you're attracted or repulsed by them if you're not going to be near them or dictate what people should do because of what you believe.,"its ok to be asexual, but i don't find it ok to be repulsed by human body parts. if you remove , there still is basic biology, anatomy, plain and cold.",people gotta learn that it's okay to be asexual.

also, my irregular  is also not helping much too. as what i've said earlier, my period occured 2x on diff days last month. i feel like i am just delayed bc truthfully, we never had penetrative  and i've been overly stressed. but i am clouded by these perceptions and imaginations i have in mind and i still can't neglect the possibility.

thank you. thank you for having lots of patience with me.,"like i said in my first comment, ""you had protected . you don't need to worry about pregnancy.""",do you think we're good? still can't stop overthinking about it,random off cycles are normal. there's no need for blood work when a period was due today and hasn't started yet.,"that's why i suggest a tshus blood work. i believe you know what it is then.

do you know of any possible ways to induce or start a delayed period?"
"hi there. please reach out to me if you ever need to talk. i'm currently 9 days late and just saw this, had similar experience without the blood.
i tested positive in saturday and immediately negative a little while later due to it not being my first morning  anymore. i'm waiting it out until this weekend to test again just to be sure.
i'm 26 and i know how it feels to have no family to talk to about these things. i have my husband who is my biggest support, however a friend is always nice to have in these moments.
i experienced this exactly the same in march and it was a very early rejection of the body. i am here if you need to speak",i'm trying to but it's been almost an hour and no reply sadly. but thank you,i don't know where you are but... if you are feeling upset and you live in the us there's a number you can text to talk to someone. text home to 741741 to reach a volunteer crisis counselor. they might also be able to help you find a primary care provider.,"thank you for the advice. i don't even have a regular doctor at the moment, so honestly not sure what i would do. i feel strange though, tired and sad.",let your doctor know. if a miscarriage didn't resolve completely some of the left over dead cells can cause infection.,"i wonder that to be honest. it is possible i was pregnant, am sexually active",is it possible you could be having a miscarriage?,"yes, i'm bleeding to the point of needing a pad now which started a few hours before the horrible cramps. but this was a very abnormal time for me, especially the  changes, so i'm like ""wtf""."

you really don't need to test again. a  reliable 14 days after  and definitive 21 days after .","thank you so much this really helped.

"you said your ""bloods"" came back ok? what did they say?",also my period wasn't due i just randomly started bleeding,suffer from heavy periods has mirena put in june to help. then suddenly about two weeks ago i was bleeding suddenly a lot and clotting so bad it got dislodged. i do have uterine fibroids but they've never caused anything like this before just heavy periods. i went to hospital twice and was basically dismissed. ultrasound came back clear although fibroid on left side obstructed view of that side.,"any chance you could fill in your relevant medical history instead of me just asking hopeful questions and you giving back one-sentence answers that shoot me down? in one post you said you've been to the hospital twice; in another you said you've been hospitalized twice. this is like looking for a pin in a ballroom at midnight using a one-watt flashlight, and you're behind me moving stuff, come on!","no i haven't, yes they know it's out.",have you sent your gp pics? are they aware of your expelled iud?,with the way the nhs works i get referred from my gp i don't just have a gynecologist unfortunately,"well that's a relief. your obgyn may refuse to ***see*** you, but what if you emailed her this picture?"

tampons shouldn't be left in for too long, i usually change it around 4-6 hours, depending on how heavy my bleeding is. i second the comment about menstrual cups tho, they're very comfortable but it takes time to get used to it!"
"i couldn't do without my cup. i started with the diva cup 10 years ago, and eventually evolved to the femmycycle cup within the last 5-6 years. i've never looked back, i'd rather work with an ice cold menstrual cup than deal with a pad or .",i was going to suggest a menstrual cup and then i saw this. i liveeee by my super jennie cup and it saves me from surprises like this. totally get what you mean with the first insertion though.,"it's fine, really. i can't feel it after 10-15 minutes, but during that initial warm-up period is just my nitpick.","maybe it's placed wrong, i can't feel mine.","yeah, it's more about getting used to the feeling of the cup again, like there's always the initial adjustment where the cup is settling in and you can feel it for a little while before it gets comfortable. if anything, i should probably warm up my cup before insertion, that would probably help a lot with the ""*ugh*, there's something in my vagina"" feeling.",have you tried ? i keep a (thoroughly rinsed) small hand sanitizer bottle filled with  with me so it's not so bad.,"i should do that too, it's just the first insertion is like jumping into cold water. you really don't wanna do it but after you get past the , it's fine.","this is why i love my menstrual cup, i can put it in just in case without wasting money."

"sasly i dont keep track ofmy period but i think i had it in september the last time, and for 6-7 days. then i didnt have it again.. and again....",no that has no effect on your period,i sometimes . does that have to do with anything?,"what the bot said, but ask your mother about seeing a doctor first, skipping your period for months at a time should be checked.",what is planned parenthood?,"sadly no, you think your mom wouldn't take you to a doctor? maybe planned parenthood is an option, they are completely confidential and will answer all your questions and ever check you out.","im scared to tell my mom. she'd probably brush it off and say its normal. are their any ""home remedies"" or medication?","have your parents take you to a doctor, it may just be your cycle trying to regulate itself, but it's always prudent to see a doctor, it's good for your sanity and good for your health."
i will next monday. thanks <3,"oh alright, i'm glad it's not an ed, definitely check up with ur doctor and gyno and give them all the unusual symptoms you're having",no. i meant my digestive system. and hair loss,"if you have an eating disorder like anorexia then that could be the cause of your period disappearing, if that's what you meant by you're not healthy",actually i am not happy cause i am not healthy. but yes i agree period sucks. thanks :),"i hope this isn't too hard for you, or maybe you're happy because periods , either way i hope you get some answers and feel good :d",yeah i will,you should probably talk to your/a gyno
stay strong sista. you got this!,"thank you very much, especially for the tips!",great. just make sure you have a chance to tell her (or him) all the symptoms you are feeling so she can help you feel better. i hope you feel better soon!,"okay, i'll take your word. thank you! i am having my next visit soon to the ob anyways. just a follow up check up. i guess i can go on my own hopefully.","i understand. vitamins are good. trust your ob. but also make sure she (or he) knows all the symptoms you are feeling so she can help you understand and make the right decisions. if she doesn't know all that you're experiencing, she won't be able to help you as well. if you think your mom won't understand, you could ask your ob (or the nurse) if you could have a moment to talk to her alone. then based on what you tell her, she can do whatever tests she thinks are appropriate. it can be tricky, but most obs are aware of how these sensitive topics can be awkward and can create the time/space to hear you alone.","okay, thank you for that. my ob only told me to take vitamins for now. i just don't know whether to have a test or not... and even if i want, my mother won't permit it.","if the pain is cyclic (with your cycle) then it could be endometriosis or 'just' painful cramps. for painful cramps you can take naproxen and sometimes a medication like pamprin will help if bloating is a problem. hot water bottle on your belly when you curl up in bed (if you can stay home).
if the pain is more constant (i.e. not related to your periods), it's important to have a test for vaginal infections because some can go upwards (into cervix, , fallopian tubes) and cause pelvic pain and those need to be treated. those often have a vaginal discharge. if they test for vaginal infections and it turns up negative, they can look for other causes.
they can test for those even if you're bleeding.","they have not yet tested for other infections. well i should have update but i am already having my pero, but i still feel pain when i am having the cycle."
ill try to get my hand on some. thank you very much,just about all of them. i'm a big fan of tampax pearls.,which brands have applicators?,i would recommend getting something with a plastic applicator until you get used to the whole period world. non applicator tampons are challenging even for an experienced person. get a light or slender  and see how that works for you.,"the brand is ob procomfort, its in a plastic wrap sort of, the  itself is just cotton, it doesnt have an applicator",what kind of  are you using? does it have a plastic or cardboard applicator?,i put my foot on the toilet and did it like that but i cant get it right. it just falls out,"it's unlikely that your  is preventing the  from going in. sometimes  insertion can be painful if the inside of the  is dry. if your flow isn't heavy right now, fold up some toilet paper to put in the  of your underwear for an hour or so. try the  again after a while. if you're still having the same issue, try changing the angle of insertion. you can also try some different body positions. some people have more success with putting one foot up on the toilet rather than sitting down."
thank you very much for your help!,"if you can, it would help :)
another poster also suggested to try different positions... everyone has slightly different angles to their vaginas, so it can help to tilt your hips back or forward to find the right angle for your body.",it says normal. should i get a smaller size?,"what size is it? it can help to start with the smallest  available, especially for those who are quite young or slim built","the brand is ob procomfort, its in a plastic wrap sort of, the  itself is just cotton, it doesnt have an applicator",what kind of  are you using? does it have a plastic or cardboard applicator?,i put my foot on the toilet and did it like that but i cant get it right. it just falls out,"it's unlikely that your  is preventing the  from going in. sometimes  insertion can be painful if the inside of the  is dry. if your flow isn't heavy right now, fold up some toilet paper to put in the  of your underwear for an hour or so. try the  again after a while. if you're still having the same issue, try changing the angle of insertion. you can also try some different body positions. some people have more success with putting one foot up on the toilet rather than sitting down."

well now that i've seen your post, i definitely think tackling the anxiety is what needs to be done. i've just been trying for so long to do that, and i feel like even my psych has given up on me . i started therapy recently because i figured maybe i just need to talk and vent for an hour every other week. i'm not sure if it's working yet, but i haven't been going that long.
i've had 2 kids and my stress level/anxiety has raised significantly each time. it's almost unbearable. i'm going to keep working with my doctors to try and figure it out, though. i think my next step is to ask my on to do another blood test to see if anything was missed. i feel like my hormones are messed up which is leading to my anxiety, my pmdd, and my heavy  periods.","dude, don't be sorry. i honestly have suffered. i feel you so much. i laughed at the ""your  looks great"" bit, lol, like not funny, but i've heard the exact same thing told to me.
i consider myself a sharp person, and for so long i was like ""hmm, i just cannot believe that 'stress' is causing the level of period problems...maybe worsening things, but not the root cause.' as of right now, i have been proven wrong. it's just been incredible.
do you think maybe tackling the anxiety first could be an angle? of course, i'm not a doctor, but that's what inadvertently helped me.","haha before i saw this i was about to reply, ""i think anxiety is doing everything to me .""
yes, i'm answer-less. when i went in for an ultrasound about a year ago i told my mom, ""not that i want there to be anything seriously wrong with me, but i'll probably lose it if i go in there and they tell me there's nothing wrong with me.""
guess what happened... ""oh your  looks great! you look perfect."" ugh. they try the birth control thing every time i'm there, but bc makes me batshit crazy, among other side effects. they finally gave me a prescription of tranexamic acid, but it literally does nothing. it's supposed to cut the amount of blood down significantly because it helps it to clot... but not for me.
i've also had blood tests galore done, but they can't find anything there except for low iron which was actually caused by the horrible periods.
i keep seeing things about how extreme stress can make you not have a period, and i keep wishing that if the anxiety is going to stick around that it would stop my period. i guess it could be doing the opposite.
sorry for the long reply. i guess i'm just venting.",i guess i should rephrase: is there anything else wrong that could be causing the horrible periods or are you answer-less too (aside from stress and anxiety)?,ugh!!! do you feel like the anxiety is doing it to you too?
"it usually does, but no way to know for sure. anywhere from 4-7 days is average.","ohhhh i see, okay, thank you! do you know if it will last as long as a normal period would?","a withdrawal bleed is not a true period. the bleeding can be heavier or lighter than normal.
> plan b makes your period come two to three days early, not an entire month
that's not true. a woman bleeds because of a drop in progesterone. after ovulation the body produces progesterone. progesterone is elevated for about two weeks and then progesterone drops. that drop triggers a period to start. plan b is a big dose of progesterone. when it leaves your body, progesterone levels drop, tricking your body into thinking it's a progesterone drop after ovulation, and you bleed.","yes but i'm concerned about the amount of bleeding and how early my period came. plan b makes your period come two to three days early, not an entire month.","yeah, it sounds like the plan b worked. the info was for an in the future type thing.","oh okay, i'm glad to know that now. but i doubt i'm pregnant, i've been bleeding like a stuck pig","also to add on... pregnancy tests are reliable two weeks after  and definitive three weeks after . so if you want to test, you want to wait at least two weeks after  to test.","i actually took a plan b maybe four or five days ago. and since i've posted this, last night i woke up bleeding extremely heavily nonstop. i soaked through my underwear and had to lay on a towel to bed"
"yes that's what i've been thinking, that now when i've been off the pill for a year and the cycle is back in full force i just want to see how it develops and not throw it off again.
have been looking in to vaginismus and endometriosis but since  is just painful 2 days of the month and no problem the rest of the days it doesn't really seem like the same thing.
but oh well, will call a gynaecologist tomorrow then i'll see what happens!","it's not good to constantly start and stop bc either. throws you cycle off. sometimes coming off birth control can cause extremely heavy periods or no period at all for months.
there are many different kinds of birth control, maybe you can find one that works for you. there are also iuds. i am on something called visanne and it works well for me. it's the third brand i've tried. the rest were terrible.
i would def talk to a gynaecologist because i'm no doctor but it's a red flag that you are struggling with periods and painful  too. definitely a sign of endometriosis but could be other things too. you can have endometriosis with no symptoms at all, so it does not 100% mean you have it but that is definitely a symptom you need to bring up to a gynaecologist. good luck.","would definietly say we're doing a lot of foreplay, 60% of the times we don't even do piv but just licking,  stuff.
i do have heavy bleeding and clotting. when i take care of myself good (sleep, good food, excersize etc) my period is usually a bit better. this months period has been brutal and honestly i believe it's because i've eaten so much candy and sugar and not any vitamins etc the past month.
2016 was the first time i tried birth control to help my heavy bleeding. the pill completely erased my menstrual cycle. i quit after half a year cause it caused anxiety.
skip forward to 2019 when i again began on birth control, that time to help the cramps. stopped taking them 1,5 year later, also because of anxiety.
now i'm thinking about it again uhh.. the problem is when i am on the pill i forget how terrible my period is, and when i'm off the pill i forget how bad my anxiety is while on the pill. which leads to this cycle of beginning and stopping birth control. it's exhausting that i can't find the right combination and solution for my body.","i also forgot to mention, are you guys using enough ? is he doing enough foreplay with you? not doing these things properly can cause pain.
there is also a medical issue called vaginismus that can cause extreme pain during any type of . it causes your vaginal and pelvic muscles to involuntarily tense up and not allow . if you're not having issues with your menstrual cycle it totally could be this. endometriosis would probably show other symptoms such as extreme pain during and not during , extremely heavy bleeding, clotting, fatigue, pain when having a bowel movement or urinating, constipation etc.
either way, please talk to a gynaecologist so they can find a solution for you.
also if you're having pain during periods and interested in birth control, i would recommend taking it continuously (skip placebo pills and go straight into next pack) it stops your period all together. i have been doing this for a year due to endometriosis and i couldn't recommend it enough to anyone experiencing painful periods, endometriosis or not. it's changed my life","in what country are you living if i may ask?
in finland the health care is relatively solid so hoping for the best!","i mean they'll do a pelvic exam and see what's going on. it might not be. but if nothing looks out of the ordinary it could be. but good luck getting diagnosed and treated properly, it's taken me 8 years to get a diagnosis
and i'm still fighting for treatment.","oh no don't say that, but yes i should check it up",i'd talk to a gynaecologist. could be endometriosis
try searching period calendar,or could you maybe send me the link please?,"maybe it's different for different devices, cuz when i type ""period tracker"" they're all pink (and white)... but thank you anyways","nope. green background with white daisy, just called period tracker","that's fine, i think i found it, but it has a stroller on it and it says that it's a baby tracker app (feeding, sleep)","it is, i also just realized it does have ads on the bottom of the screen, never noticed before lol",is it in the google appstore? cuz i can't find it,"i use the amila period tracker app. green with a daisy on it. super simple, no ads. not sure about importing data though."
"that must be so difficult for you, i can't even begin to imagine how you've felt over this. and i'm glad to hear that i've been of some help!! no worries love!!","in my case, my parents would literally  me if they found out that i've been engaging in such activities and having doubts like this bc they are bounded culturally in the traditional ways. i really really hope that i am just having a delayed cycle. thankyou for the assurance and for sharing your experiences too! you're brave and really admirable. i won't be able to sleep tonight if not bc of you hehe. thanks a lot!!!","yeah of course, i'm a similar age to you and even though i'm completely of age, pro-choice as far as abortions go and my mother would be supportive- the whole thing scared the life out of me. i hope everything goes alright for you, pregnancy scares are just all apart of being someone who has periods unfortunately plus, like you said, you've barely been eating and have been under stress those are the two biggest factors of delayed cycles. with the double period last month too, it's all just pointing towards a delayed period!","i've read your earlier reply and i wanna thank you for making me feel even the slightest relief i could feel tonight. i might as well test out for myself those home tests you were saying. the reason why i was so nervous on this issue is bc of the fact that i don't want to be faced in a responsibility that i am not ready for, although i am already at age allowed to do these kind of things.
also, my irregular  is also not helping much too. as what i've said earlier, my period occured 2x on diff days last month. i feel like i am just delayed bc truthfully, we never had penetrative  and i've been overly stressed. but i am clouded by these perceptions and imaginations i have in mind and i still can't neglect the possibility.
however, your words gave me a whole assurance and relief. i want to thank you for tonight!!!","also i'd like to point out, i suffer badly with irregular periods. at the point where i forced myself to get a pregnancy test i was 2 and a half months late and i didn't have a period until i went back on birth control - so you can imagine my worry about being pregnant. bodies and period cycles are so so weird, being pregnant is far from being the only reason you'll be late especially since you said you had a period on the 15th of september. but ofc i can understand the worry!","thankyou for this. it meant a lot. however, buying such testing kits here in our country is unfortunately viewed as a stigma. i wanted to do the same thing, buy the kit, test myself and have a peace of mind. however, people here in our country seems too judgmental and i am afraid of being called out in diff negative names just because i am engaging in such activities. i'm scared for that.
i would like to ask, did your pt turned out positive or not?","hiya love, i went through the same thing back a year ago. honestly, most of the symptoms i had i'm convinced i made them up in my head because i had convinced myself i must have been pregnant. the only thing that helped was just getting a test, just for peace of mind. i'm in the uk and i'm not sure if it's the same everywhere but no age will be asked and they're widely available in supermarkets.","i feel like i've been experiencing pregnancy symptoms lately (except from breast sore, increased urination, fatigue, pelvic cramps, headache), in short, i only feel nauseous and hungry. and my weeks have been so dreadful for i stay up late daily, drink coffee a lot, been under a lot of stress and anxiety."
thank you. thank you for having lots of patience with me.,"like i said in my first comment, ""you had protected . you don't need to worry about pregnancy.""",do you think we're good? still can't stop overthinking about it,random off cycles are normal. there's no need for blood work when a period was due today and hasn't started yet.,"that's why i suggest a tshus blood work. i believe you know what it is then.
i removed the old wive's tale from this post because people like you don't deserve to know about it. although, op is free to dm me. i'll be happy to help you if needed.

at the moment tho, she still haven't gotten her period and it's still worrying us. we're only 18 and we don't get jobs in our place until we finish college.
do you know of any possible ways to induce or start a delayed period?"
"hi there. please reach out to me if you ever need to talk. i'm currently 9 days late and just saw this, had similar experience without the blood.
i tested positive in saturday and immediately negative a little while later due to it not being my first morning  anymore. i'm waiting it out until this weekend to test again just to be sure.
i'm 26 and i know how it feels to have no family to talk to about these things. i have my husband who is my biggest support, however a friend is always nice to have in these moments.
i experienced this exactly the same in march and it was a very early rejection of the body. i am here if you need to speak",i'm trying to but it's been almost an hour and no reply sadly. but thank you,i don't know where you are but... if you are feeling upset and you live in the us there's a number you can text to talk to someone. text home to 741741 to reach a volunteer crisis counselor. they might also be able to help you find a primary care provider.,"thank you for the advice. i don't even have a regular doctor at the moment, so honestly not sure what i would do. i feel strange though, tired and sad.",let your doctor know. if a miscarriage didn't resolve completely some of the left over dead cells can cause infection.,"i wonder that to be honest. it is possible i was pregnant, am sexually active",is it possible you could be having a miscarriage?,"yes, i'm bleeding to the point of needing a pad now which started a few hours before the horrible cramps. but this was a very abnormal time for me, especially the  changes, so i'm like ""wtf""."
here is a good post that can explain in more detail:,thank you so much for all of the information and answers. we've been overthinking for almost 3 weeks and i'm relieved about these informations. thanks for all of your help!!,"that's just confirmation bias. just because none of her other friends have experienced a very normal and common thing before is just a coincidence. late ovulation is normal. she's not pregnant. if she's worried about why she ovulated late, then she can speak to her doctor and her doctor can also explain that it's normal.","out of all of her girl friends, she's the only one who has experienced this and this long delay. are there any answers to that because im really curious and still a little nervous","a period starts about two weeks after she ovulates. ovulation can get delayed days, weeks, or months, but once she ovulates then she'll get her period about two weeks later. so she just hasn't to wait it out.","thank you again, can i ask if the ovulation is late, how long, how many days does it take for her next period to come??","it's completely normal to have a random off cycle every once in a while.
you really don't need to test again. a  reliable 14 days after  and definitive 21 days after .","thank you so much this really helped.
although we're both overthinkers and are really unstable when we dont get assurance so i think we'll buy just buy one more just to be sure. thank you so much this im relieved after reading this. but why did she ovulate late?? is there something wrong??"
try searching period calendar,or could you maybe send me the link please?,"maybe it's different for different devices, cuz when i type ""period tracker"" they're all pink (and white)... but thank you anyways","nope. green background with white daisy, just called period tracker","that's fine, i think i found it, but it has a stroller on it and it says that it's a baby tracker app (feeding, sleep)","it is, i also just realized it does have ads on the bottom of the screen, never noticed before lol",is it in the google appstore? cuz i can't find it,"i use the amila period tracker app. green with a daisy on it. super simple, no ads. not sure about importing data though."
"haha yeah! it is better to be safe and having to be dreading if the next period would ever come or not lol! i am glad you will be having orotected  from now on and i am glad this experience gave you good lesson but nothing bad actually happened in the end! i say this because once a friend of a friend got  had one  ( i dont think they pulled out though ) and she got pregnant and knew only after 2 months when 2 of her periods skipped in a row! so i was pretty shocked how she got pregnant from a single  so we should be careful. i am not trying to scare you though!!
yeah i do hopeee i am good lol. i have to go buy the kit and test tomorrow!",i totally understand being paranoid we are on the same boat! i have had one partner my whole life planning on keeping it that way. i do plan on having protected  from now on this is like a huge lesson yk? but thank you for telling me your story! i really do appreciate it if you had protected  tho you should be good maybe it is cause of stress our periods have a mind of its own! if you ever need anything lmk!,"woaaah congrats then for not being pregnant haha!
i am 24 yo and i am still very worries maybe just maybe i could actually be pregnant by chance lol. like i said the last time i had protected  was on 28th of june. last period last day was 24th of june. my periods last 3 to 4 days max. first 2 days i see bleeding. last 1 or 2 days just blood clots and drops of blood. i fill like 2 pads max per day on first 2 days of my periods. my cycle is about 28 to 30 days long on an avg so i was expecting my periods mid of july last month but i got some bleeding only on 30th of july. the issue was the bleeding was too light! my usual period itself is pretty light but this was even lighter. i filled only 1 pad per day for 2 days. then i saw only blood clots in my . i didnt think much about it back then, since i was just glad i got my periods after 10 days of delay in periods lol.
i was also veryyyy stressed last month, since our home was under renovation so we had to stay out and eat restaurant food for every meal which already made me feel not so good since we all know bout restaurant food. so i think this could be a reason but i am scared still. today is my country's indepence day so i didnt go out to get the test kit but tomorrow i must! can you tell me more about your test kit so i can buy a similar one in here and i can also reassure myself that i am not pregnant lol
so basically my whole para was just to tell you stress can have very great effects on your body. the last time my bf broke up with me, i missed my period for a month. though my period is very scarce, i get it pretty regularly and consistently. it always comes after around 28 days and stays for 3 to 4 days. so me missing a month of my period was really weird for me when my bf broke up with me. later when we got together and had a huge fight, my periods came only after around 40 days, again due to stress. i also experience high hairlfall during these periods. so basically from my experience i can say that  plays a pretty important role!
also, as a 24 yo i just want you give you a few advice lol. i am not sure if you are like me, ( though i have protected  all the time, and also have  only for max 2 times a month, and check every time after he has cummed if the condom is intact and not broken i still get veryyyyyy scared until i get my next periods ) but if you are like me i highly first of all do not recommedn you to have unprotected  at all. it has both the dangers of sti and also still potentially the danger of getting pregnant. so i recommend you to have protected . and try to have  on days you are not ovulation! find your date of ovulation with those ovulation kits! my app (flo) gives me prediction about my ovulation day and the day i have high chances of getting pregnant. i avoid all those days i also add extra 3 or 4 days to the days predicted by flo lol. also, this is not something i do but if you are not from a  place like india i recommend you to go on birth control so you can be veryyyy sure that the probabily of you getting pregnant is less than 1%. i guess its 0.1 or 0.01 percent or something! i am not sure how hard for you to get emergency contraceptive pills or abortion pills if things actually go wrong. if those options are very hard or impossible for you to get to, i highly recommend you follow all these so you can have a peaceful  life lol. as for me since i am very paranoid about all this, and since i cannot get a birth control pill i just decided to not hav e  again lol.
so sorrrryyy for typing so much!!",the internet is the worst when it comes to implantation bleeding thankfully reddit has people with the same experiences! i did just take another test clear blue is a company name for a pregnancy test and they are 99% accurate i did it with my first  this morning came out negative! thank you so much i am a 17f so i know my body is still changing i have been stressed with colleges etc so i'm not sure if it has to do with that,"okay so i had a similar issue as well. i am 24 yo and i had protected  with a condom on the ssme day you had your last . it was the last time i had  too. i had my last periods a week before that. so i was expenting my next periods in mid of july but i did not get anything until 30th of july. it was quite lighter than usual and had blood clots in it. i was soooo scared this could be something called an implantation bleeding that happens when implantation occurs.
so i went all over the internet trying to find out what even this bleeding is supposed to look like. aparently it is supposrd to be just some spotting which is either pink or brown. many websites mentioned it usually does not have clots. also the max days before which implantation can occur after having  from my research online is about 15 or 16 days.
you mentioned your first bleeding is about 1 month after your unprotected  so i guess the chances of it being kmplantation bleeding is less. but i dont know the reason for this bleeding as well!
and now you are again having some more bleeding. i am honestly not sure what this means but you being pregnant is actually very unlikely. also the clear blue test you mentioned, i am sorry since i am from india i dont know what that actually is? is it the company name or a specific kind of test?
even if you are pregnant, you have been pregnant for long enough to get oretty accurate results in your hcg tests. i guess that clear blue test you did is an hcg hormone test for . you have taken this  months after having  and i guess you if you are actually pregant right now you should probably be at the oeak of your hcg hormone since it declines only after 12 weeks. so if yourr  test showed negative, it probably means it is negative. but to calm yourself down i recommend taking a few more in a few days of time gap early in the morning with your first .",okay so last time i had unprotected  was june 28th maybe that was the last time i had any type of intercourse then a month later i got a weird inconsistent flow of a period bright red blood brown blood a little bit of pink for like one wipe that lasted that lasted july 22 to july 27th including two spotting days one in the beginning and one at the end. now two weeks like august 11th - 15th i have had blood clots medium flow red blood little bit of burgundy blood in the first days i did take a clear blue digital test and came back negative,actually can you tell me when you had your last  and what kind of protection you guys used and how long after you had this bleeding? basically can i get more details lol and i shall give you info based on my experience,is a blood test more accurate he never came inside of me he always pulled out before and finished off with his hand
anytime!,"hopefully. i'm not too worried that she's pregnant at this point because given the last time we had , her period would have to be earlier than usual to be able to get pregnant (given the ""fertile window""), which she's said it's absolutely never early. plus given that she was sick it would make even less sense. i just would like her to get on it obviously. thank you for all your input :)",yeah genetics play a significant role in that. i don't know what's gonna happen as mine's still pretty irregular. hope she gets this sorted out :),"fair enough. my girlfriend is only in her mid 20's so i'm not sure how much of a difference it makes, but anyone can be irregular. seems like after covid especially which is good to know","i mean i'm a teen and got my period less than 2 years ago, so it's normal for it to not be regular yet. mine was always regular tho since i first got it until i caught covid. after that it has been very, very inconsistent, so covid definitely had an effect on it",wow! i'd tried to read up a little bit about what it could potentially do but it's good to hear about first hand effects. my girlfriend has had a history of not having completely regular periods either so this could definitely throw it off,it did! i skipped mine actually. got it 40 days after my previous one. after that they were very inconsistent. got it in march and it still isn't regular,"out of curiosity, those of you who had covid, did it delay your periods? my girlfriend is two days late for her period and i'm not worried (yet), but i think it could be explained that she not only got covid, but she got it pretty hard. she wasn't hospitalized, but at times she complained of trouble breathing, and had an awful cough (she still hasn't shaken it despite being negative), plus a lot of body aches. i'm worried that she seems to have not even had symptoms of a period yet. she complained on saturday night that her skin was starting to break out and that happens before her period comes, but as of monday she has no other symptoms besides a zit or two, not even cramps or just general sickness. if it's wednesday and she isn't on it i'll be freaked out but for now i'm just curious of your guys' accounts
edit: as of friday, five days late, she's on it. i'm relieved"
"ovulation tests don't even confirm ovulation. they just give a heads up when it *might* happen. they are just very easy to use. temping will confirm when ovulation happened, but it's not as easy because you have to be consistent with taking your temperature as soon as you wake up and before you get out of bed. some people would rather  on things than remember to do something the second you wake up. but temping is much more accurate and reliable than ovulation tests.
you can read about temping here, and there are more resources to read linked in the post:","oh, i never realised how easy it is.. i really wish school would teach these things because when i googled it most that came up was ovulation kits. thank you very much for your help",all you need to track ovulation is a digital  thermometer and the app fertility friend.,"true, it's just all the other times it started early that was unusual and i took the vitamin c (a lot less at the time). i supposed i assumed the effect carried onto the next month. but if it's true that it can delay a period then that's a big relief. i did notice a sign of ovulation starting a bit late since i never really get much discharge to see if i am ovulating. i can't exactly access an ovulation tracker atm, but it is something i have considered for the future.","it's completely normal for cycles to vary. plus you said your period came early and you didn't take vitamin c. you can't pick and choose the data that you want and propagate it forward. studies have actually shown that vitamin c can lengthen a luteal phase by a couple days of there is a vitamin c deficiency, which will actually make a period come later.
if you want to know about your cycle, then track ovulation.","ok, thank you
it does seem like a big coincidence that my period started to start earlier with the vitamin c though. i just hope it comes soon","if you didn't have unprotected , then you don't need to worry about pregnancy.",so there's no possibility that i could be pregnant?

about ?,no i'm genuinely concerned,i know wat i did.ur here trying to bash me,you were not on birth control. had unprotected  when your partner did not pull out. your period is late...? that's what people who want to get pregnant do.,lol no it didn't, ed 100% failed you oh my ,whatt,probably pregnant

> gender as a tool of oppression
gender is a tool of oppression used by the patriarchy to control and keep women under submission. gender is socially constructed ideals under patriarchy for how men and woman should behave and be treated based on their . gender is the found in gender roles and femininity. it's what says women need to be quiet, submissive, to be caring. it's what says that women aren't as smart as men, that women are too emotional. it says that real women should wear make-up to make themselves more attractive to men. it says that women's biggest goal in life is to bare children. gender is what kept women out of leadership positions, working, owning land, and being heirs.
when the trans community says that gender exists, they are saying that these sexist regressive stereotypes that harm both men and women are innate in the sexes. they are saying that because they don't adhere to the ""innate gender"" that they aren't that gender they are the other gender. thus reinforcing the idea that socially constructed gender is not socially constructed and instead is actually innate in both sexes and cannot be abolish nor can women or men be liberated from it's constraints.
by admitting that gender is harmful and not innate in the sexes, we as a society can fight to eliminate this ideology so that men and women can behave however they would like.",how tf is being trans a tool against women? like that is anti vaxx levels of dumb,what a thoughtful rebuttal.,that is the dumbest  i've read today.,it reinforces socially constructed gender and keeps gender as a tool of oppression in play against women. why not abolish gender instead of change boxes?

"excepts that no trans movement actively does this. if you are a girl who likes trucks or football or anything no one will tell her that she is a boy unless she tells it herself. my best friend is a boy, born male, but he uses long blonde hair, make up, skirts, high heels, is gentle and kind to people and continues being a boy. we have a lot of trans friends and no one ever said to him that he is a trans girl and should accept that, everyone refers to him normally. but on the contrary i already read comments of radical feminists saying that they felt discomfort of having a androgynous person in the girls bathroom. she could even be a cis woman, imagine having someone asking if you are a boy or a girl only because you're looking in a way that can't tell by itself? this is also reinforcing gender.

technically accurate, but misleading in reality. they were allowed to compete *if they had gender reassignment surgery.* the vast majority of trans men do not have grs. currently, about 1/3 of trans women get grs, and that number would have been substantially smaller even just 5 years ago. effectively, the olympics policy barred 75%+ of trans people. the surgery restriction was only dropped in 2016, meaning we've had a single olympics where any meaningful number of trans athletes could compete.","this is the problem.

"> since there is science behind transgenderism, there are ways to prove who's real and who isn't.
""science"" here means self-reports from the person claiming to be trans; this is how the vast majority of mental health diagnoses operate. it's not a particularly scientific process, particularly in an era where anyone can research what psychologists look for online (and before the internet, trans people passed around that kind of information by mouth.) nobody is doing brain scans as part of the diagnostic process for being trans. brain scans are sometimes done in research, but that's a totally different ballpark from diagnosis and the research itself is very mixed.","the point i'm trying to make is that there can be instances where a real trans person is being purposefully misgendered because the bully is trying to get a reaction from the trans person. that's harassment. it's like when certain lgbt+ people purposefully misgender trans people like blaire white solely because they disagree with her (because she's not leftist enough to be, by their definition, actually transgendered). or in the case of families not supporting their transgendered person, they may purposefully misgender to belittle and subdue that family member. among, of course, other things.

"she's advocating for schools to be more understanding of young women sometimes needing time away from school during particularly bad menstrual cycles. i don't think that's synonymous with not advocating for girls' pain to be taken seriously. i see it the opposite, if schools could recognize how much of a problem it actually is that necessitates time off here and there, it could highlight the actual severity of the issue. thinking op's opinion is the equivalent of not advocating for proper diagnoses is very black and white thinking..
i don't think you're understanding when i say i've had my fair share of bad periods and i have no underlying conditions. other people with an actual diagnosis may not even experience a period that bad, point is everyone is different. but that doesn't mean the woman with a horrible period shouldn't get checked out. we all know our bodies more so than the next person so our ""normal"" isn't going to be a constant amongst other women, with pre-existing health conditions or not.","""grin and bear it"" is literally for those who it's just unpleasant. not ""curling on the floor fuzzy vision and puking"" unpleasant.

most women with no underlying conditions don't have debilitating periods. there's a crisis of underdiagnosis in gynecological disorders, especially endo, where it takes anywhere from 4 to 20(!!) years to get diagnosed, depending on the symptom(shortest for infertility, longest for chronic pelvic pain **despite 70% of female cpp sufferers having endo**).
>birth control methods like paraguard can cause a horrific period too..
i have a copper iud as well, have had it for over 4 years now. day 2 of the period consists of 10-minutes waves of debilitating pain for about 8ish hours where i can't walk and need to curl up to see straight. if i need to be functional(job, exam, important class, sleep) i take painkillers, otherwise i power through. i know this is my choice and many would choose the painkillers. having a metal stick rammed into your  is an underlying condition.","i don't think op is trying to negate the experiences of women with actual reproductive health disorders. but it is normal for women with perfectly good health to have some pretty debilitating periods, speaking from my own experience and a lot of fellow women i know. no pcos or endometriosis on my end, and i have had some catastrophic periods. birth control methods like paraguard can cause a horrific period too..","the 80% don't have it as bad. the 80% aren't the ones who can't walk because of their cramps. 20% is 1 out of 5 girls. in a class of 20 girls, that's 4 girls.","and that's only 20%

of course they're capable and in an ideal world they should be expected to do so. but we don't live in an ideal world. mankind will not be our ally; they remain our enemy. the sooner one makes their peace with it the sooner one can get to the actual fight and abandon futile diplomacy.
men won't start valuing women or stop feeling entitled as **they have nothing to gain and their superior status to lose**.","i grew up and live in the east coast of usa.
i disagree with you that american culture emphasizes women only be housewives. at least that perspective is outdated. that concept began to die well before women's liberation and civil rights in the 1960's and 70's. granted there are regional or religious sub cultures that do have a greater emphasis on ""a women's place is in the home to serve the husband and kids"". but mainstream culture for the most part expects girls to become independent women.
granted misogyny exists in a lot of ways but feminism and gender equality is a thing. the u.s. is very large and each state has its own laws and regulations. some states criminalize abortion which infringes on the autonomy of female/women citizens. then there are some states that better fund free medical care and  education for young people by having free clinics with birth control options attached to a public high school.
it also depends on your own personal experiences, the way your were raised and how you see yourself in the world.

all the men and boys, and girls and women in my life are for sure feminists even though american society is still oppressive in many ways our institutions uphold white supremacy/racism, the patriarchy/misogyny, and capitalism exploiting it all.
that oppression is unwelcome more often than not when people become aware of how systemic oppression impacts their families and communities. the fight to dismantle a very effective oppressive system is difficult. education organizing and advocacy/ activism is essential for everyone to engage in. how is dependent of the form of oppressive system you live in","i grew up in a westernized country. that classmate immigrated from eastern europe. you think your culture is different but in america there's an even stronger expectation of women to be **only** housewives, where i'm from they're expected to work full-time both inside and outside the household.
and yes, girls don't live in a vacuum. that's the main issue. girls grow up in a system that actively seeks to enslave them to their male peers. boys and men will never value girls and women as nothing but slaves, it's just not beneficial to them. we must fight for ourselves without expecting their support.","we are not from the same country and culture.
where i am from there is not such thing as homemaking days or not going to school to do house work. granted their children who care for their siblings outside of school. but it's against the law for girls and boys not to be educated, that's why there are public schools available to anyone.
so the context for our understanding of and experiences with the patriarchy in education are bound to be different vary our perspectives. cool!
more power to you to fight for your education, financial independence, and your sense of self. do what makes sense for what is true to you. as always be careful and i stand in solidarity with you to be revolutionary and create the space you and others needs to be fulfilled and self sufficient.
i encourage to continue to reflect on how the patriarchy impacts everyone ( girls, boys, women, men, non binary, gender fluid, young, old, sisters, brothers, daughters, sons, moms, dads,) how do people react to the benefits and privileges afforded to men/boys, to the disadvantages laden on girls and women.
girls and women don't live in a vacuum, we live in a world where everyone exists together so the patriarchy continues until boys and men also value girls and women. and the laws and policies of our societies also value the genders and sexes equitably.
good luck","if girls are allowed to stay at home during their period, the patriarchy will excuse this to give them ""homemaking days"" - i've seen it with a classmate of mine who got leeway for missing school since she was a fresh immigrant, the 50% of the year she missed school she was caring for her younger siblings and doing housework. since nobody gives a  about female pain, this will be the reality of every girl except ""only"" for 30% of her schooling.
we can't restructure the system yet, we don't have the power. we have to push women to not only succeed but excel in a system stacked against them to prove to women trapped in the patriarchy's webs that they have a cause to rebel in order to gain it. because men won't give a  even if every single girl was scoring straight as when the average boy grade was a c- and all learning methods were male-focused to compensate; they'd just resent girls for overachieving. so we have to keep fighting no matter what.","i partially agree with you.
i am talking about the space still needed in education that allows for each student and teacher to be treated as a whole person. for their needs to be considered in their education as a part of what they need to help them learn.
male female. early childhood or higher education. we all need wellness days (physical or mental/emotional) and we shouldn't be penalized for having our needs met.
the patriarchy and misogyny negatively effect both males and females. and obviously disproportionately more so negatively impacts women and girls.
so yes education is key for independence and self sufficiency for all people.
but no one is encouraging girls to stay home during or bc of their periods.
the point is girls should not be penalized for menstruating. they should not be penalized for taking a day when they need it because periods can be physically taxing especially if you have some undiagnosed medical condition that causes extreme pain, fevers among other things. but girls and women are expected to power through discomfort and implicitly taught to not listen to their body. it's problematic and detrimental to everyone. a girl experiencing uncomfortable and painful periods is not going to learn very well in the classroom during that time anyway. we need to restructure the system to accommodate young women, so there wouldn't be a risk of falling behind academically.
i guess i wish for a society that does not demonize, revere, exploit and diminish girls and women experiences with their own bodies.","because academic achievement is a requirement for higher education and/or practical training.
and they are a requirement for women's financial independence.
every girl encouraged to stay at home during her period runs a higher risk of growing up not earning enough to fend for herself."

my periods are really heavy and i usually need to drink a lot of water or i feel quite faint, which means i  a lot. when you  with a  on the  can absorb it and grows bigger. believe me when i say this is either comfortable or practical. changing a  every 45 mins is not a good idea either, as the bottom bit gets wet but the top bit doesn't and it can hurt if you pull it out when it's still dry.
when i started using a menstrual cup my life changed. cups weren't around when i first got my period, but life would have been so much easier.
i would recommend a few things when buying it:
- don't go for the cheapest option. i'd say a eur20 should be reasonable. cups last years (i still use the first one i ever bought 6 years ago!)
- look for the right size for you, cups will have their specs online and you then know what to buy.
- buy a soft one. i have a harder one and a contractable one which is much softer as it folds into this tiny circle. i find the second one more comfortable to insert and remove cause it's very soft against my walls.
- ensure you keep it clean. use soap and water when ever you have access to a sink and you're removing it. once you're done with it at the end of the month, boil it. you can buy a microwaveable case which makes life easier.
- cups are leak proof as long as you wear it properly, which can be tricky to manage at first. when you put it in (there are hundreds of videos online explaining how) and you feel it's completely secure, pull a bit. do you feel some resistance? good, that means it's sealed against your walls.
- be carefully when removing it, specially if you have long or fake nails. i've accidentally pinched myself instead of the cup and it hurt a bit, but nothing tragic.
let but not least, give yourself time. some people are naturals with their periods, and some people (like me) take ages to figure out what works. wishing you all the best!!

cis,"you can't acknowledge both biological differences and accept that males with a trans identity are women! they are diametrically opposed ideas.
transwomen do not ""have a seat"" at the table of womanhood. they are not women, they are males. they are also seeking to encroach on our spaces snd places at women's expense. women are being reduced to body parts and body functions to accommodate their fragility! bereaved mothers being referred to ""birthing parents"", women being referred to as ""vagina-owners"", or ""person with a cervix"", people who need abortions ffs. it is deeply dehumanising and robs women of our right to name ourselves.
they are demanding access to our sport - despite overwhelming evidence of risk of injury and unfairness to females.
there are multitudes of examples where are just expected to budge up at our own expense, to accommodate some bloke who reckons ""womsnhood"" is just a feeling in his head, or he's watched too much  (julia serrano and andrea lung chu - who say exactly that, in their published works).
far too much is being demanded of women in the name of gender identity. and women are saying ""no"". the uk women have defeated gender ideology, and many other jurisdictions have women mobilising and pushing back also.
and seriously, i've asked you to stop using ""cis"". it's not a word, it an offensive mechanism to further oppress women.","i did not refute the biological differences of men and women or that women largely have very different physical needs and capabilities.
i did not suggest that recognizing trans women would end sexism or oppression of women and girls.
so what exactly is your point?
in any case, trans women are not to blame for female oppression and their existence does not minimize the impacts of being born with a . so i don't really see your point-- are you saying trans women aren't women because they aren't born with a  and therefore have not ""earned"" womanhood through physical struggles and oppression? are you saying that because i think trans women have a place at the table, then i must not have the slightest idea of what it's like to be a woman? excuse me while i clean my period stains off the sofa for a moment.
i don't suggest we ignore any biological differences. in fact, that was my original point in this thread- trans women aside, there is no all-encompassing definition of what female bodies are ""supposed"" to do, because all bodies will react according to demographics, health, and external stimuli. and in my opinion, saying ""oh, your body is supposed to do blah blah blah"" ignores all these factors.
you mention female oppression and you seem to suggest that trans women can't be women because they aren't born into it. but women are born into such varying degrees of privilege all around the world. if a woman is born into a progressive and affluent environment where she is able to excel alongside her male peers within her education and career, and decides not to have a child while facing minimal judgement, does she not have the same claim to womanhood as one who has had to overcome  trauma, pressure to have a family, deprivation of education, or endless violent sexism within her community? i agree that no matter what, being a woman has implications and affects how you are perceived. but that degree is much more severe for some than others. so, at what point, are you more or less of a woman?
acknowledging trans people does not inherently mean ignoring physical differences between the sexes. if it did, there would be no such thing as a ""transition."" i also think it requires insight into the striking differences of the conventional male and female brain. i think those differences are so poorly understood- one might hear, ""women are nurturing and men are good at math"" or something, but it is so much more than that. those differences exist on a spectrum, and pretending they don't doesn't do favors for anyone.
i don't suggest that every time you describe yourself to someone, or look in the mirror, you should have to use the word ""cis."" i think it's fine just to say, ""i am a woman"" and leave it at that. seeing trans women doesn't make you a subset in your own category. i only said ""cis"" because someone very specifically made a comparison *to trans people.* if you are having a discussion about trans couples, it is appropriate to have vocabulary for categories that in most other contexts we would assume as default.
personally i do not think it is more dehumanizing to refer to myself as ""cis"" than as ""a female"". i definitely have female anatomy, no issue there... but i am not a specimen being commentated on in a national geographic documentary. neither are ""males."" i only bring this up because we are having a discussion on language, though. and, while i think it's worth a mention, i'm not telling you words like ""female"" or ""male"" are immediate threats to my place and dignity as a woman, nor am i going to tell you not to use them.","cis is offensive. males are not part of the female category.
if i am not the sum of my  why are women being referred to as ""uterus-havers"" or bleeders or -owners then? it is absolutely dehumanising to be considered based on body parts or bodily functions. but having a female or male sexed body is not something a person can just ignore, it has real, material impacts on how we exist in the world and in society. women have been oppressed for millenia due to the reproductive capability of our  class, whether we reproduce or not. males of the species are, on average, faster, bigger and stronger, they are also the violent  (towards women, children and other men), that is just a fact. women do have particular needs due to our biological , that men simply do not have - , pregnancy, breastfeeding, post partum needs, incontinence, menopause etc. simply pretending these differences don't exist does not end discrimination, exploitation or oppression of women and girls.
females are the  that are trafficked, prostituted, married off as children, suffer fgm, aborted, deprived of nutrition, medical care and education, simply by virtue of our . we perform the vast majority of the world's labour - reproductively, domestically, emotionally snd even for work (globally women perform 60% of work done outside of the home, yet only earn 10% of the income). being female has implications for the way we move in society - our lives are heavily restricted compared to our male counterparts, girls (even in safe countries like sweden) move around far less than their male peers. even in such things as health care provision, our health issues are far less likely to be taken seriously, and it takes far longer to receive a diagnosis, our pain is routinely dismissed and minimised.
our  has a profound influence on our lives, i find it remarkable that you appear to have little understanding of this.","i didn't say it was wrong to suggest a body is ""supposed"" to work a certain way, i just said it merits discussion.
i think the comment above was just suggesting that while perhaps appropriate in this situation, saying someone's body is ""supposed"" to do something shouldn't be generalized as a solution for comforting a self-conscious partner, because their body might not always work as expected.
anyway, it looks like you agree that it merits discussion because you've really engaged on this topic!
if you can't accommodate others then you are fragile. ""trans fragility."" please, you are the one offended by the word ""cis."" let's just assume trans fragility is a thing-- that wouldn't mean your own fragility isn't.
i don't understand why women, or anyone, feels disenfranchised by the existence of trans people.
biology does not epitomize your humanity, your womanhood or anyone else's. i don't know about you, but i don't let my  decide what should be offensive to me or others, not is it the sole determiner in what i believe is important.
it is not uncommon for women to not have periods for reasons such as prolonged stress or athleticism, and while that should prompt a visit to the doctor, it certainly doesn't define them less as women and doesn't even always signal an alarming issue. actually, halting your period is what your body is *supposed* to do to conserve energy and withhold ovulation in these situations.
let's also not suggest that women who have periods are of ""child bearing age."" many of us have periods between the ages of 8-12... do you still suppose that's the defining point where women and girls are of child bearing age? is that really when you become a woman??? could it be that maybe the language you use, as a woman, also has its own limitations and consequences? do you think that because you were born with a  you are except from saying anything incorrect about the state of womanhood? are you reeeeally being oppressed as a woman if someone does so much as to say the word ""cis?""
i will use whatever words to address other women as i have the right to, as do you. i said nothing  or derogatory. i said ""cis"" because *you* brought trans people into the context of the thread. i think that when you say someone's body is ""supposed"" to do this or that, there may possibly be a connotation associated with ""supposed"" that suggests in order to be a woman, your body must be abc. honestly before you mentioned trans people, i wasn't even thinking of them- rather i was thinking about cis, er, biologically born women who miss periods or don't have them, for whatever reason. but *you* made it about trans people. but okay.","don't use ""cis"" with me, it is offensive and dehumanising to insist males with a self-declaration of a trans identity are women. women are not a subset of their own  category.
and yes, a woman or girl having her period is normal, it is what female bodies are supposed to do. if you are of child bearing age and not having a period, unless pregnant or taking contraception that halts your period, there is a problem and you need to see a doctor.
men need to get over it. and the trans brigade need to stop rewriting language and being so demanding of women and girls to make accommodations and subjugate their own needs and language to cater to trans fragility. biology doesn't give a toss about  theory.","i think you can chill though- i don't disagree, but trans couples aren't ""extraordinary"" (as opposed to straight cis ones) and the language we use about what bodies are ""supposed"" to do at least merits some discussion.",oh come on! it's an intimate moment between an ordinary heterosexual couple - not everything is about trans.
"this isn't about me, i have light & nearly painless periods, like you :)

and don't even argue with ""well she should've recognized the symptoms beforehand."" when mine were very irregular (i'm on birth control that has helped mine) i would sometimes get false alarm  symptoms.

please be careful though not to exceed the rda. overdosing on magnesium (and any supplements, really) can be a bad thing. read more [here]()","if i understand what i read correctly, the magnesium could be doing a few things. your body needs it to move so it could be relaxing the , and giving it what it needs to not cramp up, or it could be inspiring your body to produce/balance out a hormone you need to not cramp. i really hope it helps you too","thanks for the detailed response! justt coming off my period, so i got 3 weeks to replenish my magnesium","most importantly i take a non laxative ""gentle"" version, according to my research (and do you own, there have been several clinical studies) don't do magnesium oxide. i started off with oxide and it worked but major tummy ache problems. either way for $15 per month its absolutely worth the experiment if you experience intense pain like i did, i take 2 pills twice a day i think 800mg per day, probably overkill but im extra paranoid about pain.","ooh i want to start magnesium, thank you for reminding me! what strength do you take, if you don't mind sharing?","i feel like i have ptsd from mine, so much pain that when i was little i literally wanted to die instead of getting it again. another woman on here recommended i take magnesium every day, and i can't believe it, its drastically changed my life. i still get tired and bloated but i can go to work/function now. definitely don't find periods empowering, but im glad other woman do."

blood by itself is disgusting to some people.
strands of bodily tissue are disgusting so even more people.

that doesn't make saying ""post something normal"" because you don't like someones video fine though. good on you for blocking rather then having a internet argument though.","that's why i tried to join that trend, because it's pretty normal to talk about periods. my main goal was to get this video go viral, instead i got kids commenting under that vid telling me to post ""normal things"". but if you post something about boners, no one would get really mad. so if i posted something about that, i'm sure i wouldn't get immature comments. but like you said, i could've got the wrong public.",tiktok actually has a lot of videos about periods that are sharing awareness. i think you just got the wrong public. give it time it should get better

"they do get information on what the total charges were and how much you are disputing as well. so yes, they can figure it out if they keep good enough records and are willing to spend the time to go through their records.
it really depends on how much information you gave the vendor. it also kind of depends on how many of these credit care disputes they get.","thank you for responding!
can the company not cross-reference the disputed amount with the charges in their customer database?
based on their responses to the google reviews, i wouldn't be surprised if they retaliated out of petty spite.","my parents owned a small business, and as a result i got a chance to read over and respond to the disputes. the merchants don't get information like your name, address, phone number or anything. of your credit card number, the middle 8 digits are x'ed out. they get to see the reasons why you are disputing the charge and some basic instructions on how the merchant can respond with their side of the story. if they don't respond, you win by default (provided the dispute resolution agent can fit your complaints into a valid category).
there is a risk of retaliation, but it somewhat depends on what information you gave them already. if you didn't leave your name or address, then there's almost no chance of it happening.
of the credit card disputes i've been involved in (which admittedly isn't much), there hasn't been any retaliation.
further, from a merchant's perspective, it kind of doesn't make sense to retaliate. the money's gone. retaliation won't bring back the disputed charges, can result in more bad reviews, and can land them in trouble with the law. it isn't worth it for a business owner. and the employees certainly aren't going to care enough to retaliate.",my only concern is that once my cc does the chargeback they'll know my identity and may attempt to retaliate against me.,i've gone this route myself and then helped friends and family resolve disputes as well a handful of times. the credit card dispute resolution is very consumer friendly.,thank you for your advice. i'm more seriously considering this route now.,"they won't i promise. they just mention you were scammed and they'll guide you through the steps to get it refunded. i wouldn't trust this company if they make people sign ndas and hire  makeup artists.

sorry to hear about your bad experiences, but from the business side at least, this is par for the course.
the mua/pinterest complaints are very valid though. if they want to charge premium prices ( which they do) then they have to provide a premium experience.
we still do it for fun, and if you were in new zealand i'd offer to do a shoot for you, but you may have success going on to photography groups and looking for people who do it for the love of the game, instead of just as a paycheck. that opens up a slew of other issues (like pervs posing as photographers) so i do feel compassion for women who simply want good shots at a decent price."

[here's the okcupid post.]()
[here's an example of someone misinterpreting it.]()
here's the quote that everyone seems to notice:
>women rate an incredible 80% of guys as worse-looking than medium.
here's the *entire* rest of the point that everyone seems to miss:
>when it comes to actual messaging, women shift their expectations only just slightly ahead of the curve, which is a healthier pattern than guys' pursuing the all-but-unattainable.
women message men at a rate that's on a pretty realistic bell curve, even though they're not ""rating"" them as highly. it's men who only reach out to the ""hottest"" women.
and just another big obvious point: look at the ""average"" women's pics in the post. they're posed. well lit. the women are wearing nice clothes. an effort was made. the photos are showing these women at their best, they're flattering.
look at the example men's pics in the post. one has red eye ffs. they're not posed or well-lit. only one out of four comes close, in my opinion, to showing how attractive that dude probably is irl.
what this actually shows is that women do not think men's *profile pictures* are very flattering.
and i'd ask anyone who's ever glanced at a dating site, do you honestly think they are? do you think men usually put effort into their pics?
because just looking around, i'd say, no  sherlock to all of this, people aren't very attractive in unflattering pictures, and men seem on average to not put much effort into having flattering pictures on dating sites.",it originated from ok cupid data.,"i believe that statistic originated from tinder/old, sounds like some genius has taken it out of context.","lol they can't get a date on tinder because all of the women have left the app. isn't it something like 80% of tinder users are men? so yeah, on tinder, 10% of the huge population of men are getting dates with 90% of the tiny population of women, because that is what will happen when there are 5 men for every woman. that's not what's happening in the real world where the dating pool is closer to 50/50.","> soo like we collectively wait and pass around the same 10% guys? lolololol
that's basically what they're saying. the alpha chads are taking all the women and that's why they can't get a date on tinder.","not only is that take nonsensee,, but the math ain't even mathing
>80-90% of women date the top 10-20% of men
soo like we collectively wait and pass around the same 10% guys? lolololol"
"maybe it's just me, but my general impression is that men generally don't do pictures like women. watching the timeline of posts from acquaintances (not ""influencers"", celebrities, or advertisers), women largely outnumber men in sharing pictures of people.","i doubt it's an intentional effort 'not to show you care that much'. more like they use that as an excuse not to put in the work.
i get it, it's difficult to put yourself out there. maybe you're shy or lack confidence, maybe you have a hard time with all this. but again, that's when you ask friends for help. or family. if you don't have anyone in your life that supports you, you may be a lovely person but you need to work on developing your interpersonal skills before you get yourself into a relationship.
but most guys are just being lazy. maybe it's 30% fear, 70% laziness. and it can turn into this angry 'take me as i am' kind of attitude. one that extends to the rest of their life. chances are they don't exactly take much time to clean their house. or themselves. and honestly, even when i was younger and stupider, i didn't have time for that .","i was kind of wondering if there was an intentional effort to try to appear not to ""care too much"", but the last time i commented about this on reddit i was unironically yelled at about how unreasonable it is to expect a man to get a nice pic, outdoors, in decent clothes.
i didn't think that was a high bar, but i am clearly wrong (and should feel bad).
so maybe this is actually representative? i agree, i'm not surprised women are turned off by it.","i've always thought this about dating apps, that someone who puts minimal effort into his profile is going to also put minimal effort into a date or a relationship .
i never expected photoshop, a fashion show, or a professional photo shoot. but maybe google some tips on how to make your profile better? have friends take a few candid shots of you doing fun stuff? the instant 'take me as i am' is a red flag, and any girl who put effort into her profile is going to be turned off.","and if it's what i'm thinking of, it's a misinterpretation of the blog post.

women message men at a rate that's on a pretty realistic bell curve, even though they're not ""rating"" them as highly. it's men who only reach out to the ""hottest"" women.
and just another big obvious point: look at the ""average"" women's pics in the post. they're posed. well lit. the women are wearing nice clothes. an effort was made. the photos are showing these women at their best, they're flattering.
look at the example men's pics in the post. one has red eye ffs. they're not posed or well-lit. only one out of four comes close, in my opinion, to showing how attractive that dude probably is irl.
what this actually shows is that women do not think men's *profile pictures* are very flattering.
and i'd ask anyone who's ever glanced at a dating site, do you honestly think they are? do you think men usually put effort into their pics?
because just looking around, i'd say, no  sherlock to all of this, people aren't very attractive in unflattering pictures, and men seem on average to not put much effort into having flattering pictures on dating sites.",it originated from ok cupid data.,"i believe that statistic originated from tinder/old, sounds like some genius has taken it out of context.","lol they can't get a date on tinder because all of the women have left the app. isn't it something like 80% of tinder users are men? so yeah, on tinder, 10% of the huge population of men are getting dates with 90% of the tiny population of women, because that is what will happen when there are 5 men for every woman. that's not what's happening in the real world where the dating pool is closer to 50/50."
"it was explained to me that it's different for women because women just *have* those pictures already. (they, obviously, do not also require effort to actually take them. it's different, ok?)
speaking of that, i need to go check with apple to see why my nicely posed pics never showed up on my phone via gender magic.","but the last time i commented about this on reddit i was unironically yelled at about how unreasonable it is to expect a man to get a nice pic, outdoors, in decent clothes.

i didn't think that was a high bar, but i am clearly wrong (and should feel bad).
so maybe this is actually representative? i agree, i'm not surprised women are turned off by it.","i've always thought this about dating apps, that someone who puts minimal effort into his profile is going to also put minimal effort into a date or a relationship .

"love how you can speak for all men and putting down ""women like me"" for having reasonable standards and trying to fear monger me for the time i get older. what are you projecting onto me?
there's a multitude of reasons for men or women being single or not. ever thought that more older women are single by choice because they prefer it that way because the relationship before wasn't working anymore and men stay in the relationship because it benefits them more emotionally?
there are multiple variables playing into this. women also tend to live longer than men, among the single women over 65 are most likely also quite a lot of widows. how does the percentage of single people say anything about their desirability anyway? there are people who are desirable, but who are still single. some people just get into relationships out of fear of being alone or for stability.
i don't even actively date at my current age, so if i were a guy, my life would pretty much be the same because i don't date either way. or at least i'm not actively looking.
i've seen so many socalled average joes having girlfriends and being generally quite successful with dating. and no, they're not the top 10% of men, they're your everyday guy from next door that don't really stand out from the mass, but they found someone that matches them.
it's usually the ones being insecure or having poor social skills who might have a depressing experience with dating, men or women. or they just had bad luck.
all i said was that you shouldn't depend your happiness on a relationship and this applies to every  and you're coming with statistics to proove that women become less desirable among the broad mass, even though no one was talking about this.
my point still stands regardless.
it's far more complicated than ""young women are too picky because they're still pretty and have more options until they get older"". numbers are not telling the whole story.","what exactly implies that i think too high of myself? because i said that i enjoy my own company and don't let myself pressure into a relationship? please.
also since when is online dating reflective of the real world? tinder works much differently than meeting someone in the real world and most people only use tinder for hookups anyway.
it could be that women's desirability on online dating declines more after a certain age compared to men's desirability, but why would i care? i don't use online dating anyway and when i'm older, i don't want anything to do with men in their midlife crisis who look for women the same age as their daughter or niece.
like if less men are into me when i'm older, it doesn't matter because it only takes one person to click with for a relationship. quality over quantity.","girl even in online dating it's show women have much much steeper decline in desirability compared to men their age .that women when they are in their 40s men start becoming more desirable than them in dating(if you want to me to link the studies i can do it.they are reliable they have 200k big  sample size)
this literally online dating the platform that women 90% the power in dating.
i actually think older women are extremely attractive i don't believe this incel rehotic that women age badly .
but ask in guy in their 30s and tell them how dating was in their early 20s and they probably will have ptsd from how young women pickinees.
. i agree with all your statements and i don't side you friend but you seem to think too high of your self because you think you're independent women who enjoy her time alone. but let's be serious try being average joe in his 20s and let's see how you respond to loneliness and singleness.
tldr: i agree with you in everything in this post but i still think you're pretentious young beautiful woman who say that she enjoy being single and say ""singleness isn't bad"" because she has power in dating over men because she is attractive young women.
that why i'm telling you get old and let's see how you respond to singleness when men start being picky.","don't even try the old ""hitting the wall in your 30s"" line like women turn into  hags the day they turn 35, that's bs.
men have their right to be picky as much as i do and if they don't want me, they don't want me. if i don't want them, i don't want them, simple as that. there will always be people willing to date, no matter at what age and if an older guy only wants to date younger women, so be it. you say yourself they're apparently , so why would i want to be with them then? if a man in his mid 30s has unrealistic expectations, that's not a man, that's a manchild.

>is he trying to be your ""nice guy""?
i hope not, and i don't have a bf.
>how's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' pov? where is him empathy?
he is able to understand others' pov, but when it comes to this topic, he has tunnel vision, unfortunately. usually, he is kind, takes care of his friends, is considerate towards everyone. it's not as black and white and it seems like once the topic of being alone is mentioned, his inner demons come out. i understand your sentiment though and appreciate your empathy with me! i'll set much stronger boundaries with him for sure.","how's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' pov? where is him empathy? is he physically attractive? he literally treats half of the population as subhuman. is he trying to be your ""nice guy""? do you have a bf? once you have a bf, he probably will be mad at you, disappear and talk smack behind you.","oof you read him like an open book
he is pretty much looking for someone doing the emotional labor. during the conversation, i felt like he was dumping all his sorrow onto me and i could just try to shield it off of me, without any consideration of how it makes me feel when i try to encourage him and he just keeps wallowing in self pity.
i mean i don't think he's deliberately trying to manipulate, but more or less subconsciously. but i think you're right, i had a similar talk with him this summer and what triggered it was that while we were talking about the topic of dating and whether love at first sight is a thing or not, i said that attraction at first sight is definitely a thing and that i do pay attention to the way a guy looks and the way he carries himself.
meaning i want to be physically attracted. i didn't mean i want my man to look like some sort of model, just someone who i find cute in his own imperfect way. of course personality is important, but i do need that attraction, the chemistry. not that much of a revolutionary concept, isn't it? lol to him it apparently is.
it could very well be that this completely normal statement made him mad because it showed him that women care about more than the bare minimum and are not as desperate as him. just like with my best friend ""emily"" from the post, just hearing that a woman is also able to be happy without a man made him bitter enough to react like that.
coming to think of it, he is talking a lot about financial topics and his plans in that regard and is always talking endlessly about the details of a certain topic that could have been compressed into one or two sentences (to a point where no one is even really listening anymore because no one cares that much) and to lowkey try to impress people with his intelligence.
the thing is, apart from that he's a good guy, but he has a  ton of issues he needs to unpack, but he doesn't realize that. otherwise he's fun to be around but whenever that topic comes up, it's exhausting. i feel kinda torn because i don't want to ditch him as a person completely, but if he keeps getting on my nerves like that, i have to ask myself if i want to keep hanging out with a guy like that or have an honest talk with him. because dating wise, i'd never entertain a guy like him either.","he sounds like a typical low emotional intelligence guy to me. instead of working and self reflecting he just continues the denial and it snowballs into inceldom.
men like this are desperate because they're relying on their partner to fulfill a lot of their needs. self acceptance, stability.. sometimes even entertainment. so not having a partner is just him bouncing to one side of the room to the other because he can't work on his own self acceptance or entertain himself properly. he desperately doesn't want to be ""alone"" because he dumps basic human needs on women. it's like walking around with a huge basket of dirty clothes and crying that you need it washed asap (only by a woman) because you never bothered to learn how to do it yourself.
these guys also love to strategize relationships because they don't see the other gender as an equal. it's always a red flag when someone is ok with potentially ""manipulating"" their way into having and maintaining a relationship. like pick up artist culture.
of course he is not going to like women having their own standards and wanting to be with attractive men.. that means he can't control or manipulate them into dating him. they use money/income, social status, ""intelligence"" as date baits and it's pathetic.
i don't think it's worth the time and effort to deal with these guys anymore, seriously. they're tricky and insecure enough to try to bring you down with them."
"if you're able to have conversations about this, you're still further ahead than many, many couples. you say that you're disappointed and that you're not getting your emotional needs met without a lot of work. does your guy know about this? maybe there are some small tweaks you can do to your communication about this so that this doesn't build into resentment.
can you see him making an effort (rather than performing ""effort"")?
it's hard to develop a routine if you have add, but once you have some self-awareness, life becomes easier.","after a lot of reminders he does. it usually drops off again though if i stop reminding, so it doesn't seem like he has thus far been able to incorporate these asks into part of his routine.
i wouldn't say i'm bitter, just disappointed i guess. he has an absolutely atrocious memory (i also suspect adhd/add) and forgets to do things for himself as well, so i can't be too  him, but it definitely feels like more work than necessary getting my emotional needs met.","and does he do it? do you have to keep reminding him? are you trying to teach him your standards, or just how to repeat your actions?

>i always have a pretty good hard separation of people i can see having friendships with and people i'd have a  relationship with
i can understand that. to me though, the possibility is always there. i don't really picture a romantic relationship as a  relationship though, the  part of it is more of an ""add-on"" but i also view  relationships a bit different than normal, like i'm perfectly fine with my romantic partner having other  partners so long as they're only  partners, meaning no going on dates, etc. that's definitely not the norm though.
i guess you can say that i compartmentalize the different aspects of a relationship and am capable of viewing them more individually rather than entirely holistic though they are obviously all connected in a relationship as well.
idk, people are weird, man lol.","you didn't word it bad, i misinterpreted your words. i meant to come back to it after i re-read it, got a phone call, got distracted, here we are lol.

>whether you like it or not, from the very second you meet someone your brain is already trying to figure out where to place them in your hierarchy of relationships.
not necessarily. i tend to go into all relationships as friendships. but that's a me thing, as i'm not really interested in romantic relationships. i always have a pretty good hard separation of people i can see having friendships with and people i'd have a  relationship with (and of course there's overlap there, fwbs etc.). but i guess i'm an outlier in this; i know my disinterest in romance isn't the norm, i accept that (also i'm a widower. i just have no interest in ever being in a romantic relationship with another person)",">so, as one guy to another, i gotta say..your mindset might seem innocent but it genuinely seems like you're getting into friend groups in the hopes of romantic encounters developing, with people who aren't aware of this (but who might suspect it) and that isn't really fair to the people who just want their friends to be friends. honesty goes a long way my dude.
but this is kind of an ""unwritten rule"" dictated by human nature. you don't start off loving someone, you *fall* in love with them over time so naturally you're most likely to develop feelings for people you spend the most time with, ie; people within your friend group.
>the issue with your stance of ""building friends groups of potential partners""
i thought i clarified this pretty well, i don't build friend groups of potential partners and i certainly don't add people to a friend group solely because i view them as a potential partner, i add them to my friend group because we inherently connect as friends, meaning we have commonalities in our likes and dislikes and our personalities seem to mend pretty well. most people wouldn't be friends with someone they have nothing in common with and can't stand their personality.
a recipe for a good friendship has tons of similarities to a recipe for a good romantic partner which is exactly why people tend to develop romantic feelings for someone within the friend group.
i might've worded things bad in my last comment, but i don't go ""i haven't tried a relationship with mary, let's give her a shot because we work together well as friends"", it's more of being cognizant of the feelings that are organically devolping (or not).
whether you like it or not, from the very second you meet someone your brain is already trying to figure out where to place them in your hierarchy of relationships. this is constantly being evaluated and adjusted on a per person basis typically based on shared events with said person. now who do you have the most interactions with, thus the most likelihood of their position being adjusted in your hierarchy? that's right, your friends.
because of this, there's always an inherent potential of developing feelings for someone within your friend group. which is why it's pretty ridiculous to verbally aknowledge the disclaimer of ""hey, i don't have feelings for you right now and i may never, but there's always the possibility that someday i might"". like that is literally the case 100% of the time.","the validity of your point is directly proportional to how honest you are with your intentions. the issue with your stance of ""building friends groups of potential partners"" is are the potential partners willing and consenting participants to your goal of basically trying to find a partner within a friend group ?
like, people get into relationships with their friends.  my friend group's relationship rate is a bit redonk, but we're all nearly 40 and have known each other since high school for the most part, and while some have dated others (repeatedly over the years lol), but there's an honesty there. but when you get into a new friendship - anyone, man or woman - there is usually an undercurrent of wondering on intentions (especially on the women's part) and it's important to be clear in that regard. so many women feel blindsided and manipulated by who they thought were friends, real friends! who it turns out they wanted more. they never lead them on, gave them any indicator, but because they were friends, they were emotionally open and loving..and a lot of men take this as romantic interest.
so, as one guy to another, i gotta say..your mindset might seem innocent but it genuinely seems like you're getting into friend groups in the hopes of romantic encounters developing, with people who aren't aware of this (but who might suspect it) and that isn't really fair to the people who just want their friends to be friends. honesty goes a long way my dude.",">they enter into these friendships because they are hoping to pivot it to a romance.
i want to address this a bit. i don't really have an interest in going on random dates with people i don't know, what i prefer is to be friends first before i dedicate time into building a romantic relationship. the reason being is that the likelihood of a romantic relationship working with someone you already know you click with is far more likely (but obviously not impossible) than with a stranger you met or tinder.
so what tends to happen is that i look to friend groups for potential romantic partners. now this doesn't mean i'm only friends with someone because i may potentially want to date them, i'm genuinely friends with people because at the time, that's all i was interested in. as the friendships build i may or may not want something more.","the issue is too many lads (am guy btw) enter into these relationships facetiously. they enter into these friendships because they are hoping to pivot it to a romance. it's so horrible. i don't know a single woman who doesn't have an example of a guy who she thought was a friend trying to turn it into something else. media has a big hand in this with all the romance  and ""she'll love you eventually"" type  (i'm gonna stop here coz i can rant on this subject for a while lol).
and yeah the adult way, people think it's the end of the world. too many guys are putting too many eggs in their emotional baskets, and building these fantasies in their heads, only to be absolutely crushed about something that never was! and yeah there's issues about a lack of - emotional i forget the term, when men are lacking in it - but that's not on women either. women shouldn't need to be on guard all the time worrying if a guy friend is gonna ""fall"" for them because they shown a bit of emotional affection.
anecdotal as  and i'm aware of it but i blame young kids not playing more with opposite genders. all lads i know with emotional maturity had girl friends growing up, and have women as actual friends in the friend group.
(also jesus christ live with women friends for a while. that'll shut that fantasy  right down. you wanna get a sense of how normal people are live with em for a while lol)","i agree if she doesn't want a relationship and you do and it's clear that's not going to happen best to just  the relationship all together. or at least put it on hold for a good long while.
i don't understand why it's that difficult to grasp.
""sorry, i can't help but have feelings that move beyond platonic for you so i think it's best we not pursue any relationship for the time being. maybe in the future things will be different but for now this is best.

"i get what you're saying, and i can only speak for myself.
i trust my wife completely. she's back in school studying in a male dominated field and she's hung out with some of the guys that she's friends without outside of class on several occasions.

"hate to break it to you, but not everyone believes in 100% of their parties values. you might believe in 100% of the democratic views, and that's good for you; but you are one of the few people who are able to say that. i already said before that their stance on abortion is the reason i am not voting for them this year. i believe government should not be involved in medical decision making.
overall, democrats believe in more government assistance to the general public and republicans believe in less. that's the main fundamental difference between the two. from that fundamental difference, i am a republican, because i believe in that fundamental belief. how they feel in a given year about a particular issue is a different matter and people are given the choice each year if they want to stand with their party or not based on those issues.","i hate to break this to you, but the republican party is entirely flawed. i left it for a reason. banning abortion nationwide is a goal of today's gop. if you're in the gop, you're okay with that goal.

what?

if you're in the republican party, and you usually vote for republicans, what does that mean? i take it to mean you're okay with their platform.",just because the current candidates don't match my views doesn't mean that the whole party is completely flawed. it's more effort to change your party every single year than occasionally voting for the opposite party. and there's a reason you're allowed to vote for the opposite party in the first place,you also don't have to stay in a party that doesn't reflect your values.,i'm not voting for them and never said i was... why would i vote for someone i don't want elected. you know you don't have to vote with your party,so why vote for them?,"i know if my state elects the two republicans that are running, i will be abstaining from  until marriage. i am republican, but i cannot support an all out abortion ban",every age group is having less  . not just teens. i imagine we will see even more of a decline after the abortion ban.

"they had 59/60 in 2008. 50 for the past 2 years. way more than the 50/51 they won't have in january. there needs to be more progressive, active, aggressive democrats. unfortunately there are very few of those, and we are going to keep losing ground no matter how hard we pull the blue lever. progressives need to step up and accomplish much more.","but in both examples you cite regarding supreme court justices the democrats were powerless, mitch mcconnell was senate majority leader and making the arbitrary rules. the hypocrisy was obvious but voters didn't hold him accountable for it and he was reelected.
there are plenty of things that i believe democrats would do if given enough representation in congress while holding the presidency. codifying roe into law for starters, then longer term gains could start to be made on climate change. they could attempt to rebalance the landscape by putting term limits on justices, granting the option of statehood to puerto rico and dc, and electoral college reforms. i think these are the types of things you refer to as what the right does that you say the left isn't willing to do. i think we are at the point that it would get done if the votes were there but we absolutely need more democrats in congress to test that theory. if they have the numbers but still don't deliver then i'll agree with you, but so far i don't really think they've had the chance.","trump sets the mood, the agenda.
remember when the scalia replacement was denied in late 2016 because of the election year  made up rule? and then it was abandoned when it was time to replace rbg? that kind of  that the right plays that the democrats never get near. that's the kind of thing thats been shifting he nation for the worse.
do i have some ideas as to what should be done? sure, but they probably aren't very good. here's the thing. it's not my job, i'm an engineer, not a politician. my complaint is that the people we elect, the people whose job it is to do these things, they aren't good at their jobs. they're making almost no progress. even bernie, who i think is the bare minimum of progressive that we need, just hasn't shifted things much.
if i were as effective in my job as the democrats are, the people who employ me would sit me down and say something like ""hey, you're not really making things that work here, what needs to be done to fix that?"". it's a conversation that needs to be had with politicians. we make too many excuses for why things aren't progressing rather than trying to actually make progress.","i don't necessarily think from a legislative standpoint trump had that much of an impact. obviously he was and is terrible for the country and the hateful rhetoric is very damaging, but it's not as though he had that much of a legal impact. the supreme court appointees are largely what got us into the mess that started this discussion but 50+ senators approved each one as well so there's more accountability than just trump.
you still don't give any actual steps though that democrats should be taking to create the progress we're looking for.","it cuts both ways. you can't say presidential power is limited and then say trump is  everything up (he is, because it isn't nearly as limited as it should be).
look at all the damage that the recent 3 or 4 republicans did and compare to the good that the recent 3/4 democrats did. it's completely unbalanced. pitifully so. sure we get a sliver of progress every so often ( marriage... and.. umm....) but for every one of those, you get a tidal wave of regression.
the worst of it is that progressive ideals and policies would truly help 90% or more of the country, but democrats pursue these things so poorly that a substantial number of people fight it tooth and nail, and a large chunk of people who would be for it are so unenthusiastic about it that they don't give it a second thought.","presidential power is fairly limited in the grand scheme of things.
i'd be interested in hearing how you recommend ""they"" accomplish anything since you allege they are doing things the hard way.","oh horseshit. if there was ever any president who was as far left as reagan, bush and trump were as far right, things would be a lot better around here. what obama was supposed to be during his first term (not what he actually wound up being)
the right keeps getting their way playing the game their way and what passes for their opposition is so busy trying to do things the hard way that they never accomplish anything progressive.",there really hasn't ever been an opportunity to codify roe. the political system being how it is the votes have never been there. unfortunately it often takes rights coming under direct attack to accomplish anything and democrats are the only chance at making positive change.

it may not have been literally every year but they have tried repeatedly to pass these laws and they always get blocked. sometimes a democrat votes to block these but afaict it's never made a difference.
finding anything older is difficult as search results regarding abortion are completely poisoned right now by seo for more recent news as well as corporate censorship wrt limiting knowledge on how to safely get abortions.

i'm pretty sure she doesn't use a mirror because it's just a smear, no shaping or anything. she says she can't start her day without her war paint","same! i never loved having to wear makeup but once the pandemic forced us all to work from home and anytime i'd go out i had to wear a mask, i stopped putting it on and just never started back up again. also shifted to more of an interest in skin care which has been great!
i grew up with a mother who wouldn't let me out of the house as a teenager if i wasn't wearing makeup. i had bad acne that i wanted to cover up and my mom grew up in the southern usa where being ""presentable"" was absolutely crucial to your social status. so i have always had a weird relationship with makeup. even now in my late 20s, if i mention to my parents that i have an important zoom meeting or event they'll ask if i'm going to put makeup on for it. like, no? this is my face, it doesn't matter how important the event is it's not going to change the face i present to people.
it's been so freeing to reach this place with my self confidence!","for me, it was covid. i have to wear a mask constantly at work (hospital) and have had to do so for the past 2.5 years, so wearing makeup didn't make any sense. it only ended up on the inside of my mask, and it was too expensive for that. eventually all my makeup expired and i found that i didn't really want to buy new. i am very interested in skincare, though, so my hobby just shifted a bit.
like you, i'm enjoying my newfound freedom of just walking out the door with a bare face if i feel like it.
(and no, i'm not one of those people with naturally beautiful skin. i have a mustache that i have to shave every morning, i have oily skin, and dark circles under my eyes. but it doesn't bother me anymore, and i've never gotten a bad comment, even from people who knew me ""before"")"

it might take a while to find them, but i promise you, speaking from personal experience, that there are kind and wonderful men out there who will show you and your body the love and respect they deserve. men who will prioritize your pleasure and comfort, who will want to help you heal, who will honor what you've been through and treat your trust like the precious gift it is. they might not be the first you find, and you might not find them right away, but they do exist.

"that's what i'm trying to say, about mexico. people trying to congratulate mexico for having a ""left"" wing party, when 95% of that ruling party is made of people that were part of the oppressive party that ruled mexico for 75 years.
and all that just because they legalized abortion, wich it was going to be legalized anyways whichever party was in power, as protests and strikes kinda work in mexico.
again, the goverment of mexico didn't legalize abortion. the activists, and the hundreds of thousands of protesters did.","doesn't sound like he's very far left. sometimes people are  at identifying politics, and ""economic nationalism"" sounds to me like a very right wing position.","exactly, the current president it's far left and he passed the law.","> like a couple months ago the mexican federal government passed a law to cut regulations on food production.
that's right wing in any context.","i meant us left wing its not the same as mexico left wing. for example the religious, uneducated poor that votes against their own interests vote maga in the us, and vote left in mexico. like a couple months ago the mexican federal government passed a law to cut regulations on food production.
btw i'm not talking about brazil, they/we needed lula to win against that extremist. and to save the amazon.",yo what the  does this mean???? poor countries don't deserve left wing governments???,">while also aligning themselves with catholicism and the military.
and cartels.
i'm far left in the us, as america it's a rich country that can afford social-democratic policies for the benefit of the poorest and poc.
but mexico needs a right, center-right goverment and their economic and judicial policies, or even a real leftist.
as op said the progressive policies passed didn't have to do anything with the current government and not political party would dare to struck them down or fight them as they are the will of the people.","i wouldn't be so optimistic. at least in mexico, the government it's left-wing only on paper. it's more like a centrist-populist. with some left leaning policies. while also aligning themselves with catholicism and the military. in other words, it's complicated. most of the advancement in human rights have happened thanks to the hard work of activists and through the courts. the government only following through after the fact."
"you really clearly don't though - i'm saying that there's a small subset of makeup that is attached to ""partiarchal bs"" and there's other styles that absolutely go against it due to it being viewed as ""excessive"".
that's what i'm talking about - not makeup as a whole, but the styles that inherently clash with the patriarchal desires, workplace standards, and what is considered ""attractive"" by the general male population.
also, on a note about hijab - it's empowering in western nations where it would be easier for women to forsake wearing it because wearing it inherently brings judgement upon them from those that dislike muslims/islam. it places their religion and culture unashamedly in the front of people's minds - it's about their choice and not conforming to what is considered the ""norm"" while embracing their religion.
everything needs to be taken in context of the situation where the person is, their intentions, and what exactly the ""style"" of what they're doing is - nothing is in a bubble. wearing makeup in a style that contrasts the ""accepted"" norm results in women being mocked and attempts to enforce them wearing the ""accepted"" styles, as does wearing hijab in areas where that's not considered the norm and there's potentially islamophobia present.
 judging people for femininity, and  judging people for not ""conforming"" to femininity. that's basically my feelings - i don't feel like anyone should be judged or criticised on either side because it just devolves into women tearing down other women because they're ""too feminine"" or ""not feminine enough"". the judgement goes in both ways, it's not just from feminity spaces.","i do understand you. makeup can be a means for harmless fun or self expression. its not inherently evil. its just the patriarchal bs attached to it and enforcing it, mocking women who dont care for it. online femininity spaces are full of this stuff. even women treating you poorly just because you dont do performative femininity.","you're not understanding me - there's a range of makeup that is applied, and when you go too far with your use of it (i.e. full glam, alternative makeup, etc.) then it's no longer acceptable.
it's sure as  a choice to wear alternative or full glam makeup, because you know that there will be plenty of people judging you (both men and women) because it's seen outside the societal norm.","make up is like hijab, pretty much. it appears as a ""choice"" for some women, but how much of it is actually a choice if your natural face is seen as 'unprofessional', 'ugly' or 'too tired'. or your workplace enforces it on you but not on men.","technically if a woman was to show up in full glam makeup at certain workplaces, she may also be fired.
all of this  depends on the workplace or the male observer - too much makeup is seen as bad, just as no makeup is seen as bad. they're both choices that women can use to express themselves, and aren't necessarily ""conforming"" to the patriarchy.","then how is makeup feminist and empowering, if its just another tool to oppress women?? women are treated as aesthetic objects, men are allowed to be themselves.",employers can legally require women to wear makeup as part of an established dress code; they can impose such restrictions on female employees while not burdening male employees at a similar level.,"ok? so if a woman working in the service and hospitality industry chooses not to wear makeup or high heels, can she get fired?? would a man get fired for not wearing makeup??"
i doubted myself for a bit too. i enjoyed the conversation too so not futile. have a good'un.,"i'm really sorry! i watched this video previously, and despite going back and seeing this warning, i somehow completely missed it that it was youtube's doing. i thought that you were referring to trigger warnings that this creator uses, without actually understanding you.
this argument has been futile and my fault! :(","i was reading it as the video had been slapped with these warnings by youtube, who were basically saying that the content may be false and may mislead the viewer in some way that would have a negative impact on society.
it may be that these content warnings were in fact general trigger warnings that were added by the creator with positive intent.
if it is the latter i retract my previous criticisms, but looking at it again it does seem to be something youtube has added to ward people away as if the video is going to e.g. incite hatred or violence.
you then get into the query of is this similar to censorship or is it more similar to a general age rating as you might see for all movies.","i think you're wrong about content warning being about information, but i'm not 100% sure what it is. here are two options:
1. content warnings means that the medium features content that may be triggering, such as abuse, , substance use. trigger warning is about the discussion of such, without necessarily featuring content. for example, i could have triggered a classmate while talking about abortion, without actually featuring pictures, videos, recordings, written experience of abortion. i should put a trigger warning. if i do have any of these, i should've used a content warning for abortion.
2. content warning is about a medium featuring content that elicits strong negative emotions, such as abuse, , substance use. trigger warning is about a medium featuring content that might elicit a traumatic response in someone. if my discussion includes depiction of excessively harsh criticism, and a classmate has traumatic responses from experiencing excessively harsh criticism, i should have a trigger warning, but not a content warning. i should have a content warning if i depict or mention something that will make most people very uncomfortable. think gordon ramsey calling a cook  and him freezing/crying because of childhood trauma
so when a video contains hate-speech, a content warning would mean ""this video will contain depiction of hatespeech and not just mention it"" or ""i think that most if not all of my audience find the hate speech that i will depict as disturbing, instead of eliciting a traumatic response in only a small part of the audience""","yeh. so this video seemed to have one that basically said ""be careful with the information in this video, it may be false"". that is absolutely ridiculous for this specific video.
the ones that say ""this video touches on topics that may trigger xyz"" are a good thing.",aah. i think i got you now,"regarding content warnings: more or less i have no idea, but different ones. the ones calling out hatred (like this one) really shouldn't have content warnings, and there are far too many genuinely hateful ones that don't have warnings but should.
trigger warnings are a different thing, and are absolutely fine and more videos should have them.","are you saying ""more videos should have tw"" or not?"
that is gold,"gettin' jiggly with it, nah nah nah nah nanah nah nah...","it is now. thank you for the contribution.

op, you have every right to be mad and your response thus far is completely normal and justified. he's the one being a little  about everything. the fact that he views you as a living fleshlight during  is so horrendously disrespectful.",i just bought the wand a couple of weeks ago and tried it on a couple of times when i was alone. i used it for the first time when the two of us were together a few days ago. i think he noticed that the wand is way bigger than his  and so he got nervous.,">he then angrily asked me if my climaxing was just as important as his, and i replied by saying yes,
this question alone shows that he doesn't consider you  equals. he clearly doesn't consider you climaxing to be as important as him climaxing.
>he was initially fine with me using the bullet in bed earlier. a few days ago, i began using the wand and he just stopped and looked at me with a confused stare. i
did something happen a few days ago or have you never used the wand in bed before? i don't understand why he would suddenly go from accepting your need to have clitoral stimulation to not accepting it."
"and why does he insist on living at his mothers house, if her actions bother him?","he eats her head off too. he can go weeks without speaking to her. he ignores her on the daily. it's like we live there with her but not all that present. we do our own little things. his lack of a healthy relationship with his mom affected me in the past because i wondered if he would refuse to build a connection with my mom because of it. it's super important in my family that we're all close and happy and spend time together. he isn't treated like a ""son-in-law"", he's treated like my parents own kid. the love and respect he receives at my place is not to be found at his.","what does your husband say when your mil says racist things about you? this makes my blood boil. if any of my family members or friends said racist things about my so, heads would roll.","i love him and i want this to work on the long run. but it deeply hurts that i don't know how to be the bubbly person i once was. and now my grandma is deteriorating but the one person i want to go with me, refuses just the idea of traveling to my country. .
i know all the answers lead to i'm unhappy. and i am but  i just want to be happy with him again. i want to live life with him. i want to do things with him. i can always do it solo but i want to with him, and that's my downfall.
i know i'm being frustrating because the answers are there but i can't help but want things my husband doesn't.
i'm just feeling a lot and needed a safe place to let it out. i'm so sad.","honey you literally just said several paragraphs about why it's not just about travel.
it's not. his unwillingness to travel a symptom of his larger attitude towards you, your culture and your race.
there's nothing wrong with you.","i think it is. but i also wish he'd spend more time with my family. like actually learning them and being present in their lives.
i try to build a bond with his mom all the time. she's super mean to me when he's at work and i'm home. i usually have to spend my free time outdoors to avoid her. i only tell him a few things at a time because i know his relationship is already so bad with his mom.
i try not to make it worse but i'm living in  with him just so i could be near him.
i feel like i'm dying in order to be loved. my family means everything to me; yet i left my comfy home to spend our marriage at his place.
why can't he come and stay with my family while saving for money? it's not like we had a traditional marriage. i stay with my family almost every other weekend. if i can handle his moms racism, why can't he handle my family? we're just a bit loud and have more fun at home.
it's the little things that have become big because i don't see him trying for my family but i try everyday to be accepted by his mom.
i have to hear about my dark complexion, what i can wear or not wear because ""bright colors don't look good on dark skin and dark colors also don't look good on dark skin""
i'm considered white in my south asian community. i'm considered almost sickenly pale. yet i'm getting told on the daily that i shouldn't wear this or that.
i try so hard to be accepted when he isn't home. or when he is home. i've just recently stopped trying because now when i look in the mirror, i see myself as dark and now i have an issue with it too.
i've never been a colorist in 27 years of my life. now when i lay on his chest, i'll tell him ""wow, i've really gotten dark""
, it makes me cry just recalling this from the other day. like i actually told my husband ""my arm did get dark huh""
why have i become so disgusting.","bare minimum doesn't sound ""great"" to me.
the problem isn't about just the travel, is it?","in other ways.. everyday things are pretty nice. he makes sure we get to have our date nights, he's more emotionally present and physically present when he isn't working and home. he spends more time with me, he tries to meet my physical needs. i acknowledge all the little things he's done for me.
it's just.. it's bare minimum.. so i'm left feeling like the things i ask for more--aren't being met.
i'm sure he's probably feeling discredited and misunderstood. i'm sure he has complaints about me too; but i just feel like i'm so giving and out there and i wish he'd meet me halfway."
", guess i need to follow some local food trucks. i need this in my life. woefully out of the loop always.","oh yes. we have a hawaiian shaved ice truck that we'd never be able to find if it wasn't for them sharing their location. we've also found many local events because of them. like they'd post ""we'll be over at this event today"" and we're like, there's an event today? well let's check it out.","also for all people like to  about social media in general, its fabulous for local businesses. i love being gently reminded about my favorite local restaurants' weekly specials. or sales, or street fairs or open studio days.","this is how i use twitter, very curated. very narrowly focused on artists and cosplayers.","honestly, i love tiktok. i keep it very curated and i get videos of people weaving interesting baskets, neat cooking tricks, this one woman who repairs loved stuffed animals, permaculture and botany stuff, an interesting guy who rants about pedestrian infrastructure failures, drag queen makeup videos. all of these sites can be horrible. curate it for what you actually want and block what you don't.","eh, i'm 19 and most of my friends - even those older than me - love that app. i can't stand it...one video turns into ten then a hundred and soon enough, your whole day is gone to mindless short clips by people who don't know what they're talking about
edit: word change","tbh i never understood the appeal of tiktok at all, but i'm probably just too old for it","i deleted twitter and tiktok. they've been cesspools for ignorance, hate, and misinformation."
"that's why twitter calls it ""deactivation"", not ""deletion"". deactivating your account will not be subject to the 14 days gdpr law because it's not technically ""deleting"" your account.
in order for twitter to actually remove all of your data from its databases you have to (a) be a citizen requesting from an eu country and (b) actually ask their customer support to delete everything.
source: i help manage global user data for a cloud company and have to do things differently for eu customers.","the law applies both internationally and to private companies. if twitter doesn't pledge to be deleting all user data when an account is requested to be deleted within i believe it's 14 days then it is not legal for them to operate in any eu territory and they can face a fine worth i think it's like 10% of their yearly earnings plus whatever other damages the eu court decides.
twitter can still be accessed from europe so i'm fairly confident they are following this law.","not everyone, including twitter itself, is in the eu. also, now that it's a private company, they might just decide to keep all that data for themselves whether you delete it or not.",if you delete a tweet it's still backed up for 14 days so that changes nothing. just deactivate the account. eu law mandates that all personal data is deleted within a certain amount of time after account deletion.,"this is not true. you have to delete all your tweets otherwise your data is still there. there are 3rd party bots that do it for you because the only way to delete tweets is individually. basically, you have to give the bot your login and password and it goes and runs the script. i learned this after i deleted my 15 year old account when musk announced his intention to buy. gotta nuke it completely otherwise he still gets your data whether you use the site or not.",deactivating is deleting,"hijacking top comment to ask: how do i delete my account?
i never use twitter but i made an account a long time ago and definitely want to delete it. someone please give specific directions (for mobile users) because it's not obvious how to do it. when i went to ""help- account support"" it gave me the run around. eventually it mentioned ""deactivating"" the account, but i'm not sure if that's the same as deleting it.","nah i did this same thing a few days ago aswell. had a friend make a tweet that literally just said ""pedophilia is bad"" and she got ratioed 5 times despite the original tweet having 100 likes from people trying to justify . if musk doesn't actually do something that site is dead."

 nice,i'm the same. i had an iv removed and they had a cotton ball on and a bandaid over it. i walked out of the hospital and everyone was looking at me. i looked back and there was a trail of blood behind me.,did they not put a cotton ball on it? not that that can catch a whole load of blood most likely,"i'm a really hard stick, and then i bleed everywhere when the needle comes out. when i had surgery recently and they removed my cannula in recovery, i looked down a few minutes later and the whole back of my hand was just red.

"uh, she's 2 1/2.
i'm more concerned with messages she's receiving about beauty standards, and about how beauty is still pretty central to the lives of young girls, and what society expects from girls.
obviously you are not the mother of daughters so you're comparing the kids you had in your class to mine, and i don't think it's really relevant right now.",i didn't say that everything is solved. there's a bigger picture i am looking at here. what are you going to communicate to your daughter about domestic labor (or communicate to young women in general)? that she should just accept it or that it's worth pushing back on and not something she is required to do just because she's a girl?,">more households where the woman is the breadwinner
but if covid showed up anything, it's that women are still doing the ""second shift"" when they get home, and still hitting the glass ceiling at work.
we'll agree to disagree here.","i think it does, because it means a lot more kids and young people are questioning the gender binary, which means they are open to questioning what it even means to be male or female which has largely been a social construct, which is kind of wonderful. i didn't even know what gender non binary was until a friend (previously female identifying) came out as they/them to me a few years ago. i think it does help cis women, because it directly challenges what the patriarchy is holding up about gender norms, and basically is an f you to this system. it's brave for people to come out as non binary, and it's the first time gender as a social construct has entered the mainstream, and it does help us.
yes, there is still sexism, but besides gender fluidity there are things that are changing. there's more women who are college educated, more households where the woman is the breadwinner (), more kids with openly  parents which, more people coming out as trans and non binary (which you may or may not know about a kid for years), more people seeking treatment for their mental health, more women living their lives on their own and on their own terms. there are more movies and shows directed by women, and this has been awesome because we consume media. yes, there are still bad things. my point, is it's also good to acknowledge the positive changes, because the more we celebrate these changes the more positive impact we have on the world. if we only focus on what is worse, then what does this tell young women? it takes away their power in the world. it's awful roe was overturned, but there are still more of us that support roe it than not. if we want to push back and keep moving forward, we have to acknowledge the progress and continue to push progress. otherwise, we are giving up, and yes, we could lose more rights. but, it's not inevitable if we focus on how we want to shape the world and realize there are many like minded people, who are perhaps, the majority.","okay, i'll give you that. but i don't really think that the fluidity of transgendered or binary youth really has much impact on cis-girls. cis-girls and women don't suffer any less sexism than they did before. for them, things are very much the same, and sometimes, a bit worse.","i would say, for one thing, that are understanding of gender is changing, and this is the big, relevant change of what it even means to be a girl or boy in society. they/them is very common and accepted with young people and even kids, and kids are pretty willing to challenge gender norms in ways that didn't exist before. there's much more fluidity around gender than there used to be.
i would also say there's more acceptance and awareness of mental health and diverging from being neurotypical. so a lot of young people i have worked with are very good at talking about their struggles. this doesn't mean they'd not have struggles, but it's not stuffed down like it was a a generation or so ago. this has been my experience working with gen z. i also have a teenage stepson. the most popular kid in my stepson's middle school was a girl that came out as gender non binary went by they/them and had cool style. it had nothing to do with looks. this is a big change, and would have been unheard of in the 90s or early 2000s. gender non binary did not exist.
i'm not saying it's all better. we don't live in a utopia or equal society. that being said, i am saying our understanding and attitudes towards gender are changing, especially among young people who, frankly, are leading the way on this, and that absolutely has an impact on how kids are expressing themselves. with parents who are supportive, usually, it's good and positive.","how are things truly different for girls?
sure, body and  shaming is less prevalent, but it still happens. i wasn't pressured to send  pictures to boys when i was growing up though, and i didn't have to contend with boys watching  the way they do now in lieu of a  education. rampant sexism was going on when i was growing up, but music gave women a lot of power, and the freedom to be exactly what they wanted to be. remember the lilith faire? there was a certain message about the 90's that i don't really see much today: *it's wonderful to be a woman. celebrate your womanhood.*
i honestly can't really see how things are better today than they were then. i will say that teachers and parents are less tolerant of that  than they were when i was growing up, but that's because it's *we* who have changed, not really kids.
i guess it all depends on what constitutes a good role model.....but i didn't say there weren't any, i just said there were few. and i really do believe that.","i don't disagree there are problems for girls. i'm pointing out that there's been changes, and things are different. that doesn't negate any issues. i just think it's worth considering what progress there has been, and that kids are a bit different than when we grew up (assuming you are a millennial). i definitely don't think all issues have been solved for girls. that would be nuts.
i disagree there aren't role models though."
"not heated at all, and the psychiatrist i gathered earlier. good luck and be well","i appreciate it as well! while self esteem *can* be indicative of how successful someone will be in life it's actually one of the more shaky ways to determine their success. personality theorists see incongruence between who one is and who one wants to be as a more solid indicator for distress and other similar issues in life. this is where i really think gender roles can hurt people, like you said with your point on nature vs nurture and how they could be passed down by parents. a child who's raised to be a girl that doesn't want to be a ""girl"" (in the context of feminine stereotypes) would probably show a greater incongruence between who she is/pressured by her family to be rather than who she wants to be and that's where you'd see more insecurities or, on the other side, more acting out. (acting out is seen more with authoritarian or negligent parents)
it's also definately frustrating to see it take it's toll on others you know.
though self esteem can be built back up, you're right that it's incredibly difficult to climb out of those types of thinking. with therapy and psychiatry, many times it's not an option that many people can afford or just would be too embarrassed about attending due to how stigmatized it is. there's an incredibly large multitude of factors at play with situations like this and it really depends on the specific situations that lead to seeking out abusive partners, knowingly or otherwise.
if any of this comes off as heated i assure you i don't mean for it to, i just got out of classes so i'm a little fried, also if you want me to clarify anything please ask, i'm studying to be a psychiatrist and love talking about personality theory and child development/psychology","""loser magnets"" are the ladies who say ""why do i always go out with losers"" as you saw it wasn't an insult. i also agree that a woman who's never been in that type of relationship ends up with that personality trait. it's either a family member talking down to (or at) her or radiating off a parent who's witnessed it in their parent, i don't know exactly. i will say it's way to common and until there's some way to teach self-esteem it won't get better, unfortunately. but how, i think that comes from your own successes, win at sports get more confidence playing, same with exams at school, but i hated to see it in some of my daughters friends. i appreciate the dialogue","i'd say you're right that self esteem plays into it, i see it as the result of a self fulfilling prophecy wherein the women who you so hilariously put as 'loser magnets' are that way because they believe they can't do any better. what interests me is what causes women who're neurotypical and haven't gone through trauma/psychological programming by an abuser, to develop that sense of themselves and when it takes form. gender norms seem very pervasive with younger girls, which reminds me of this really great video essay i watched about the book titled 'the care and keeping of you' and how that book used to perpetuate ideas about dressing modestly and that it's not okay to discuss puberty and going through it (for girls of course.)
all this to say that i think you hit the nail on the head and that i believe part of that insecurity for women who hadn't already had it programmed into them is caused by how heavily parents or caregivers adhere to gender roles.
i think the idea of the ought self and the actual self also definately go hand in hand with this but i digress- i'd be happy to try (to the best of my half completed psych degree) to explain those a little more, it's really interesting stuff!","thank you, your thoughts if you don't mind.","this is an interesting comment, i'm just commenting as a bookmark to see how the discussion goes when more people reply!","interesting you say that and here's a theory of mine. i've always said the most attractive trait any woman can have is self-esteem or self-confidence. most real men are not afraid of a successful, intelligent woman but they are attracted to them where insecure ""men"" or i'll say abusive guys avoid them. a woman with little to no self-esteem in fact are loser magnets (is that too harsh?). in that situation the guy sees a woman who won't question him, when asked ""where do you want to go eat?"" will say wherever you want is fine, what movie ""whatever you want to see"" etc. which for that guy is great until it's not. at some point that does get old and that's when he changes and isn't nice any longer, now it's ""can't you make a choice?"" ""why am i always deciding, can't you make an f'in decision?"" etc. and it gets worse from there, i believe that's why so often it's ""he was so nice when we started dating then he changed...."". so a confident woman attract confident men. any replies either agree or disagree?",it really is. what you'll find though is men do exist who value strong women. and the reality is those guys still were formed within and live in a culture that is misogynistic af so they won't always get it right - but when you call them on their  they'll listen and learn.

">so no, it's not whataboutism by any definition to talk about violence against women and girls (which btw is not the same thing as violence against afab people - violence against afab people includes trans men, and vawg includes trans women, which you seem to be conveniently forgetting in your haste to turn this into two groups competing with each other...).
you were specifically talking about violence against **afab** people
>to women (and enbies) who are **afab**
i said that it isn't because someone is afab vs amab
>i think it's less of an amab vs afab thing
you were the one pitting afab vs amab (a line of distinction that i, as a non-binary person myself, hate). you were the one who in response to a trans* person turned around and said that afab people have it worse. it's no different than those men who turn around and bring up how bad male suicide statistics are, but only in response to people commiserating about misogyny. which is especially egregious when statistics show that ""women who are afab"" don't actually experience violence ""more so"" than trans people (once again, including non-binary people such as op) of **either** agab.
look, i'm going to stop replying here. all you're doing is flipping an uno reverse card and going ""no u"" on the bits that i'm calling out.
edit: and i've been blocked","um, the post also says that op *now understands what women experience* in terms of harassment and violence. so no, it's not whataboutism by any definition to talk about violence against women and girls (which btw is not the same thing as violence against afab people - violence against afab people includes trans men, and vawg includes trans women, which you seem to be *conveniently* forgetting in your haste to turn this into two groups competing with each other...).
this is a lot more complicated than you think it is, and actually unpicking the nuances and challenging some of the assumptions here is a necessary and important thing to do. shutting down discussion and trying to make people compete with each other in the way you are attempting to push for is incredibly unhealthy. literally nothing in my comments is anything but supportive of the op, and it's possible to be supportive *alongside* engaging in a wider discourse. you do not have an absolute right to set the terms of discussion here.
eta: tbh if anyone is dismissive, it's you.","both things are bad, **but** you were the one who said that people are more aggressive to afab people on a post about a non-binary person who was amab, in a reply to a comment talking about how people are particularly awful to amab people who don't conform to such an assumption.
further you posted a link talking about violence against women, and yes, compared to men women are much more likely to be a victim of violence. however, op is not a man, nor were the groups addressed in the comment you replied to (with the exception of femboys, but them being men is secondary to the point being made). i brought up statistics of violence against trans people because non-binary people are definitionally also transgender (with some very rare exceptions where a person may be intersex **and** also raised as such).
honestly your comments come off as a whataboutism and utterly dismissive to the harrassment trans and non-binary people face.","why are you trying to create a comparison between trans people as a group and women as a group? it's not a competition. trans people do face utterly undeserved violence and harassment, that's true. but my comments are specifically about the pandemic of violence against women and girls:
i don't see any need for invidious comparison. **both things are bad.**","honestly, i think it's less of an amab vs afab thing and more of a being a visible minority thing.
[in general, transgender people are 4 times as likely to be victimised than their cisgender peers. however the rate of victimisation is approximately equal between trans men and women.]()

honestly, some nights are worse than others when it comes to being inappropriately groped/stalked/cornered/pressured at a party as a woman, but i'd say that was level 10 party harassment.. i *hateeee* whataboutism, believe me, but i truly think if you were presenting as a woman, this wouldn't have happened to you at this level. this man seems to have straight up used you as a gag.. he had absolutely no regard for you as a person and i don't understand how so many people let him get away with that.. yes, you mentioned that some stepped in, but not enough in my opinion. i hope that if i'm ever in this situation as a ""bystander"", i'll do one better.
the nuances of being a woman is tough, but we have a wide support network which is really helpful.. you're journey/identity is way more nuanced.. i won't speak for all women, but this story was pretty eye opening for me.. it's time for me to step up and step in.. but i also don't want to veer into ""white knighting"".. what do *you* think?"
"i'm not saying that it's the individual's responsibility to change. i'm well aware of late stage capitalism and the hellscape that it creates. what i'm saying is that it's unfair to expect women to bring home half of the income *and* do the vast majority of the emotional and domestic labor. which is exactly what i said.
yes, i do think if men did the majority of the domestic and emotional labor, then it would very much be viewed differently. what a silly question. of course it would. everything that gets pushed off on women is devalued and given less importance in the heterosexual relationship ""exchange.""","if i'm understanding correctly, in your opinion it's essentially less about the degree or salary itself and more about the assumed contributions to the relationship based on past experience and statistical averages? so if for example a potential partner made less money than you but did the majority of the household work and wasn't an emotional burden, that would be a ""fair trade"" (assuming of course that less income = less hours at work, which isn't a guarantee in the current economy)?
>also expected to have a full-time job and provide half the income
this is probably the only thing you listed that isn't directly the responsibility of individuals to change. time was, a single minimum wage job could support two adults and multiple children. thanks late-stage capitalism and wage stagnation!","because women already do vastly disproportionally more of the emotional and domestic labor in heterosexual relationships and then, on top of that, are also expected to have a full-time job and provide half the income. so, coupling down can be seen as really doing a great disservice to a woman's worth. why even bother saddling yourself with the burden of a ""partner"" when you're the one bringing literally everything to the table?","you're right, college graduates in the us are 60/40 female/male, with the ratio trending female more and more every year. the gender divide has gotten bad enough that some colleges are looking into affirmative action plans that can be taken to increase male attendance/graduation rates.
>women have the choice of dating someone ""lesser""
i asked the person you replied to this, but i'll ask you as well: why is ""dating down"" seen as a bad thing for women?","> women often feel the need to date someone less successful than them or get lost in the dating pool.
that's just a statistics though.
if we limit to something easily measurable like educational achievement then women are the majority of students in tertiary education in (i'm fairly certain) practically every western country.
in my country the disparity is 2 to 1, in the us it's what, 3 to 2? something like that.
assuming the minority sexualities is somewhat evenly spread the women have the choice of dating someone ""lesser"", sharing a man, or being single.","this is totally valid and something i experience in my 30s as well. unfortunately in my opinion, there are not enough black (and potentially latino) men who can keep up to the success of black/latina women. women often feel the need to date someone less successful than them or get lost in the dating pool.","except when it doesn't. i have many black and latina friends who are talented, educated, and attractive who are in their 40s and early 50s who still have this issue.","you are not alone! once you get to a better city, establish a professional life, it will get better. i've honestly had so much better luck dating european guys but that's another convo."
i'm done with this.,okay but why don't you move to some of the multiple places in europe if you like their men better?,because i'm referring to men from multiple places in europe.,"also europe is not a country like the us. why not just say ""men from x country are better""?",nope,you are probably comparing men from rural areas in us to wealthy european men in larger cities. of course wealthier men are 100% better for some women.,"100% of that ""small minority of european men"" has preformed better than 100% of american men i've been with. and it's none of your business, but the sample size is enough to make me confident in my findings.",">most of them dont have that whole ""you're my first (insert race here) girl i've been with"" thing that seems to be so common amongst men in the states.
you can't generalize based of a small minority of european men you've been with"

lol. yup! the pool wasn't especially huge where i live.,"if you swiped yes on pretty much everyone, were you actually attracted/interested to pretty much everyone?",i did hear that tinder tends to suppress people who swipe yes on every match so that others don't see them crop up. which possibly  me over a little when i tried using tinder since the women on there mostly all seemed pretty great and it was rare for there to be any overt red flags like open racism in their bio.,"back in the day, when i was used okc the website, you'd be able to see when the user was last active. for the swiping era of online dating, i don't know what they do if you delete the app without deleting your profile - if you even can delete your profile. i know on at least one app i had to make a new profile after deleting the app and later reinstalling it. i also know that on the apps where they don't limit how many folks you can ""like"" per day, there are people who like absoutely everyone without exception, just in case. i'm sure many of my matches fall into that category. i don't know about needing to be a member to message on the mainstream/popular apps but they are always hawking the paid version. the point is, (it feels like) plenty of peope have success despite all these things so it gets really depressing.","this is very much the case. they need to appear to be active and have lots of people who are in the action. so they use tons of bots and fake profiles.
and always push for that golden subscription.","i am not sure the current situation in dating apps so maybe this has changed. but 10 years ago when i was doing this as a male on the big dating site of the time it turned out that a lot of women on the site were not members and thus could not respond. then when i quit the service myself, they kept my profile up even though i cancelled. the only thing i was able to do to keep them from putting my profile up when i was not part of the service was to physically delete the pictures, text etc. why did they do this? well i would get e mails from them saying someone replied to my profile. i could look at the response and profile but if i wished to respond i had to become a paying member. but back then, i know from my personal profile, they are putting profiles up that are not part of the service. they did it repeatedly with mine.
sooo it would not surprise me if some of the profiles people are looking at, responding to may not be real, or be able to respond (as i said, haven't done online dating lately maybe it has changed). so i was sending out all these e mails getting no responses back, taking a hit to the ego in the process. yet i have no idea how many of those folks were actually still on the service and could have replied if they wanted. but the ego took a hit none the less. something to consider if getting no response if they still play these games.","thank you for this. i feel so seen because emphatic disinterest is the most apt description of online dating i've ever heard. for context, i am a woman and i live in a medium-big city, on the east coast.
i get matches on any app/site i use, but i get very few messages and no one ever responds if i intiate. i have friends who will only use bumble, the app where only women can initiate, due to perceptions of safety, but i've never ever had someone i reached out to on bumble respond so i deleted it.
it doesn't matter if i say something low effort like ""hey, how are you?"" or actually put in effort to say something witty/interesting/flirty. people don't respond me. that's not to say that i've never had a reply when i initiated but of all the dates/relationships i've had from dating sites, it's probably 90 percent they reached out and 10 percent i reached out. and people don't initiate very often either. i don't know why there is so little interest in me but it definitely is depressing. sorry, this is not directly related to op but your wording rang so true to me.","i can sort of relate? i'm a guy so the dynamics at play are quite different. but when you do the online dating thing and get met with emphatic disinterest in you, its hard not to internalize that sometimes and make you feel like there's something wrong with you. people sometimes try and give you advice and tell you to revise that profile or that your picture sucks (which can hit hard when its a normal every day picture of you that is really an honest representation of what you look like) , but after putting all that effort in and still zero interest it can hit you even worse.
then sometimes someone will hit you back and normally you would realize this person is absolutely not for you and are actually kind of awful. but then you put up with them making some pretty insulting jokes at your expense and you find yourself trying not to confront them about things they say that you object to because they were willing to at least give you some attention and you don't want to rock the boat."
"i am a black woman. why would i lie about being a black woman? i think you're a troll, why else respond the way you did? not sure what exactly i said that offended you.
i'm honestly having a very hard time dating. i've seen white man after white man pick white women at church to date and marry. they've never picked me. after 5 years i finally figured out that they don't want black women. i got all my dates from online dating 5 years ago and even that was hard because i was still being filtered out. something changed during covid 19 because i haven't gotten a date in 2 years. dating in the midwest is extremely hard for black women.
dating apps have shown that black women get the least swipes. there is data on this that you can look up if you are interested.","i'm 100% for interracial relationships. i've only dated white men. i agree the problem is other races as well but when you look at other races, most other races mainly date their own race. if most black men dated black women then there wouldn't be a huge gap in black women not getting married.","babe, black guys can have their white girls. it is what it is, but the problem isn't black men don't want to date black women. no man wants to date us period. and what makes you think we just long be in such homogeneous relationships? everyone else can be in interracial relationships, but not us? we have to stick to our race to be happy and fulfilled? yeah, i don't think so.","only 30% of black women get married. the main problem is most black men don't want to date black women. they want to date white women. if all white women stopped dating black men then black men would be forced to change. 70% of black women never get married, that's a big problem.
black men are fetishizing white women. why would white women choose to play into that?
you don't sound like an ally to black women. how can women stick together when we refuse to support each other?","""you are taking black men away from us""
 am i reading?","knowing most black men date white women then dating black men. yes, you are playing into it. you are taking black men away from us. if all white women stood up for black women then this wouldn't be a problem. black men will never learn if white women keep dating them.","if a guy said to me ""i don't date black women because they are black women"", i wouldn't date him. but if he never brings it up, and otherwise acts normal, and never makes any racist comments, how am i supposed to know? that doesn't mean i'm ""playing into it"".","i agree. i'm black, through research i've discovered only 30% of black women get married. it's because of the racism. most black men don't want black women, they want white or anyone besides black women. white men only want white or any other race than black women. all other races go for the same. the midwest sucks for dating. i'm filtered out of dating apps because the men only want white women. white women play into it because they date these racist men.
religion is also a problem. racism is a lot higher amongst white christians than the non religious.
i'm planning to move south next year, i hear dating is a lot better down there."
"i think you really need to study some chinese history to see what the state did in response to religion to make those claims. the ccp were brutal in excising religion from the culture. it wasn't perfect but it was ruthless and extreme.
to suggest that the patriarchy of china is solely about religion while ignoring the atheist, communist ideals of what men and women should do seems illogical and unreasonable.
finally, confucianism being based on confucius as a religion is true. but confucius himself was raised in a patriarchal society. religions don't create the patriarchy, they're just sometimes tools to help enforce it. so are non-religious ideas. thinking the removal of religion would fix anything is foolish, look at china or nk or the soviets.","> and yet they threw it away and maintain patriarchal positions.
they didn't completely ""throw it away"". you can't just erase thousands of years of cultural conditioning overnight, no matter how much the ccp tries.
non-patriarchal religions like wicca were never in power in most places (especially so post-colonialism, when patriarchal societies steamrolled everyone globally) so they're irrelevant for this argument","and yet they threw it away and maintain patriarchal positions. the point again being that religion is not needed to enforce the patriarchy.
there are plenty of non-patriarchal religions too, like wicca.","> nobody would put china ahead of the uk for being less patriarchal, would they?
china also has thousands of years of confucianism (and it's included misogyny) influencing their culture, and cultures across east asia. confucianism was a state religion for thousands of years, and just because it's no longer an official religion doesn't mean there isn't that patriarchal baggage left over.
point is the vast majority of the time if there is a patriarchy, you can usually identify religion as a root cause enforcing it.","that doesn't really bear out in reality. atheist nations are sometimes much worse than religious ones, because the patriarchy has different tools to maintain itself. nobody would put china ahead of the uk for being less patriarchal, would they?",yet even more so when pushed by religions. let's not pretend that's not true.,"incels are found in all cultures, not just religious ones. the patriarchy sits quite happily with the non-religious too.","> people should prob stop raising their kids to believe this.
we're trying. the biggest problem is that too many men are raised in religious households that indoctrinate them in patriarchy. they're told that ""men have to take care of the women,"" thus creating the ""nice guy"" who feels entitled to women just because he'll be a ""protector"" and ""provider."""

its not a cure all for drug addiction. its not a cure all for mental health. its not going to be a cure all for men that hate women for whatever motive they may have.
but it is the best we've got. therapy is also for a lot more than literal mental illness. ""men, just stop"" is never going to work. we have to make them.","it's coddling that we suggest them going to therapy is all they need when people have no idea the slightest amount of what actually happens in therapy. if you go in and say ""i'm lonely,"" well the therapist is going to just suggest you meetups and activities to go to, where the man can then harass women there with professional approval. the therapist will not figure this out until a couple years into it, because it takes time to dig through the surface at the inner issues. we could have been raising men differently this entire time instead of wasting time and resources on people who have no intent on becoming better and hardly see women as people.
for example, mass murders are an incel related problem. this is not cured by therapy. it's also multi faceted. men who feel entitled to womens bodies do not have a mental illness or any kind of emotional distress. they are simply frustrated that they can't demand  and have women fall at their feet.
suggesting therapy is also problematic because it suggests these men have a mental health issue. this is far from it. they are usually very privileged and live comfortable lives. they are fully capable of changing their mindset on their own, to stop watching misogynistic men on youtube, to stop laughing at  jokes, to stop blaming women for all of their problems. they choose not to.
inb4 ""therapy is for everyone"", no it's really not. if you go in there with no actual pressing issues, you will just stare at each other for 45 minutes. learned this the hard way.","not trying to makes leaps, i just really don't understand what you want. i don't think you actually want less men in therapy, that's just what it sounds like. ""men need to fix it"" is not an actionable solution so i can only base what i think you think the solution is on the fact you are claiming therapy to be a solution by women and therefore a bad option.
destigmatizing therapy is the societal solution.
therapy is not coddling, as you mention it is hard work and requires active effort to change yourself.","you're making a lot of leaps about what i'm saying. individual people going to therapy is great. but suggesting every man in current society enrolling in therapy will fix the problem is insane. it's clearly not a personal issue. and when you treat a societal issue like that, you make the societal solution women, again, in a different setting. i've been going to therapy for years. i know the kind of work they do. if you do not actually want to change, you won't change. it's hard work. its exhausting. i highly doubt these types of people are willing to put in the effort. stop coddling them.","so, your argument is therapy wont work?
therapy actually is ""them working it out themselves"". people go to therapy to work on themselves. going to a therapist isnt nonconsensual, male or female they can turn down any patient they want.
youre also making it out like these are convicted felons. these are guys who think they are lonely and want to figure out why. the therapist will tell them their want for a partner is a deflection from why they are actually unhappy. therapy ensues.","not what i was saying at all. but putting dangerous men in a close setting with women is a bad idea, and also just reinforces their belief that women are there as tools for them to use to feel better. the long term solution is that men stop feeling so  entitled to womens bodies and time. they need to get used to it. this stuff is not only caused by , the media, their fathers, but also encouraged and shared by men among each other. nothing women say will change their perception of women. they need to work it out themselves.","thats the short term solution but doesnt tackle the cause. we also need long term solutions.
your solution is like having soup kitchens but no effort to create affordable housing. sure, you're saving lives now, but youre really just surviving while maintaining the status quo.
and in no instance does anyone that knows anything about mental healthcare think the actions of a patient are the fault of the therapist."
"whataboutism is not a good argument. especially when you're on reddit, which is also doing the same .
you know why i talked about twitter? because this thread is about twitter, not 4chan.","ok if you don't want to talk about *should* and talk about what *is* happening, why even waste time talking about twitter when 4chan is the website that actually creates and publishes the  radicalizing people? that's the reality. being angry over twitter doesn't change anything. if everyone leaves twitter it will become just like tumblr, a hollow shell of it's former userbase, or vine and just shut down, all the while 4chan is the one still producing white supremacist propaganda to feed 13 and 14 year old boys.
there is not a solution here where anything productive comes from dialogue about specifically twitter.","it doesn't matter what people *should* do, it matters what is happening. shouting ""they shouldn't have gotten their news from twitter"" after they shot up a grocery store or bombed a planned parenthood accomplishes nothing.","generally speaking twitter has never been a place for reliable news, its just pr as a social media for celebrities and politicians, and for normal people it's just goofing off, , and or arguing with people over misinformation",radicalized people are going to continue to get their news from wherever meets their agenda,using twitter as your source of news is the millennial equivalent of boomers using facebook to get their news,"if only ""just stop using twitter"" prevented all the issues. musk is buddy buddy with putin and about to control a social media platform that many people rely on for updates and news. prepare for more radicalization.
hopefully he goes through with his  blockchain idea so he kills the platform sooner rather than later.",just stop using twitter. people get way too addicted to that garbage anyway. it's like the mcdonalds of internet.

"the early romans believed that a good woman was a woman who did nothing noteworthy, except to honor her male relatives and her family's lineage.
lucretia is held up as an example of a virtuous woman because she ""allowed"" a man to  her when he said he was going to  her and a male  in he bed as if he caught her in the act of adultery. she would rather be  than shame her husband by being accused of being adulterous. after the , she called her husband and father to her, ""confessed"" to being  (it was seen as the woman's fault, no matter what) and then killed herself to preserve her family's lineage and honor.
roman women didn't even have real names. each daughter was given the feminized version of her father's name. if there were more than one daughter, they would be named julia major (older daughter of julius) and julia minor (younger daughter of julia).",thanks for the rec! the aeneid thus far has treated the women characters as mere convenient plot devices. some truly  moments.,"after you finish the aeneid, you should read lavinia by ursula k. le guin. it takes a basically wordless woman in the aeneid who plays a key role as aeneas's wife and gives her a voice and agency and really beautifully fleshes out who lavinia was to the story.","i read song of achilles before circe, and it was, as you said, very helpful. and so good too! i'm reading the aeneid right now so i'm getting bits of the whole trojan war saga from all these different works. may i recommend stephen fry's great mythology series, beginning with mythos? listen to the audiobooks, if possible. fry has such a lovely enthusiastic way of telling the story.
i haven't read eleanor oliphant, but will look for it! i liked piranesi, but not sure i really ""got"" it.","if you havent read song of achilles yet, please do so. same author and style, and reading circe first gives you some between the lines character building of achilles' mother, which touches on the themes in this thread. so  good.

">i knew a woman who adored babies, but lost interest once they could speak.
that might be a woman who simply can't stand toddlers, i know they can be very difficult, but it also reeks of narcissistic mother to me - likes infants she can dress up like dolls and use as extensions of herself, but no longer likes the child once they're able to form and express preferences that might differ from hers.","thanks for doing that! there's so many cool subreddits out there; hopefully someone knows of some data.
i do love a good tangent. i could see communal childcare reducing the need to opt out of getting pregnant/having a child. if there's a community of women who love kids at different developmental stages, you could stay involved in a way that suits your temperament. (e.g. i knew a woman who adored babies, but lost interest once they could speak. not a great situation if you live in a nuclear family setup, but much less harmful to the kids if she had been living in a more traditional community).",i thought this was such a great question i asked it in r/askhistorians because google scholar and jstor didn't have good options despite using several different keyword combinations. i know a smidge about infertile women in bamanianga society but because having children was part of how you became an ancestor i can't conceive of a woman admitting openly to not wanting children. second wives were a not uncommon strategy if the couple was infertile but a lot of childcare was communal and the wives lived together away from the husband so i'd imagine there was high involvement even on the side of the infertile first wife. obviously super tangential to your question!,"i wanted to add that i find it interesting that there's not a lot of discussion about first nations women who didn't want to have children. there's discussion about infertile couples fostering or adopting children from kin, or the idea of children being raised by the whole community, but not about how a woman who didn't want kids was treated. it's possible they fell under the umbrella of what is sometimes called ""two-spirit"", but that's a really complex idea that i don't know enough about to even hazard a supposition.

"thank you
oh, tell me about it. somehow *we're* the problem","hugs if you want them.
women just can't win. have no children? you're damaged. have one child? you're damaging your kid (i got that one a lot). have more than one kid? geez, haven't you heard of birth control?","i'm one of those women that've never ever wanted children. i literally used to beg my parents not to have anymore kids after me (i'm the youngest of my siblings). it's disgustingly common for those of us who don't want kids to be told we'll change our minds, all women want children, no - you can't get sterilised because what if you meet the right person.
why is it that if a 16 year old girl accidentally gets knocked up and goes through with the pregnancy, no one bats an eye but a woman in her early 30s whose never wanted kids ""might change her mind""?

there are plenty of fish in the sea, and women have historically been taken for granted when it comes to hetero relationships, but what i see now is a lot of people over-correcting and just sifting through men until they find the perfect man that does the perfect things.. and i just think that's so silly because no one is perfect and if you expect your man to know all the ""rules"" of common courtesy and won't sacrifice a second of your time to discuss your expectations, you better be  perfect, too",no. i don't think you should ever have to ask for common courtesy. i refuse to ask people for basic consideration. there are better fish in the sea.,"yes, but there was a key thing you said there: ""keep asking for common courtesy"".. i personally am just waiting for op to say explicitly that she has had a conversation with her so.
she says this has been happening for two years and she said he said he doesn't celebrate valentine's day (but i wasn't under the impression that the topic of the gift giving empty promises is what led to him saying that.. i took it as them speaking generally about that particular holiday.. i could be wrong though of course) and then she said she's just not going to get him a gift anymore..
she never said she that in two years she's ever actually had a conversation with him about this thing that clearly bothers her.. maybe she did, but i don't like filling in contextual details in order to form an opinion.. i'm very curious to know what he's said when she really brings it up.. if she has..
people are going to walk all over you if you let them.. and if it turns out that op just kept expecting her so to spontaneously change without having a real conversation, i have no issue putting some of the blame on her for not standing up for herself.. hints and passive aggressive huffs and puffs doesn't translate (which i know is a huge assumption there - i'm just giving a generally example).. but yeah, if you're in a relationship for two years and don't feel comfortable being straight up and having a conversation or just otherwise letting something like this go on for two years without explicitly discussing what your expectations are, that's not completely on the so..
all that said, if it turns out op has in fact been continuously ""asking for common courtesy"", i'm 100% with you and the majority of the people in these comments..
and actually, i'm not even an advocate for second chances honestly.. setting a boundary one time should be enough.. if they care, they only need to hear it once and there are plenty of potential partners out there who ""only need to hear it once"".. i feel like a lot of people are taking what i say as ""be patient and lenient on men because they don't know better"" which is not my sentiment at all, but people are responding to me like that's what i'm saying.. i am literally just saying: ""step 1. say something""
am i assuming she hasn't said anything yet? more like, she didn't say she said anything so i am taking that as she didn't say anything.","i think the opposite - people take yellow flags and don't have the proper caution, and that's how they end up in relationships like the one op describes, where their partner fails to show up time and time again. i've dated too many people like that to even give them a chance - and then i ended up with a great guy who *doesn't* drop the ball. it's better to be selective than having to keep asking for common courtesy, imo.","i mean, i guess we're all just different, but if i were in this situation, it would clearly be an issue (if he wasn't giving presents, but i was), but it's no where near deal breaker territory for me.. especially if i haven't even had a conversation about it first.
i posted another long winded reply elsewhere, but i just think the yellow flags in a relationship are worth a conversation before jumping ship, because people just think differently and prioritize differently.. my sister once blew up at me for something i didn't see coming one bit.. it was just a blind spot for me.. off the record: i still don't quite understand why it was a big deal or how she even cared to put so much energy into being bothered about it, but guess what? i didn't say any of that stuff to her, because whatever her reasons, it clearly bothered her and i care about her and that was enough for me to care about this thing that bothered her and be more attentive to it.. i think the ""you can't change people"" is taken too literally and rigidly..
additionally.. the other side to this is determining.. hey, is this a yellow flag? or is it an incompatibility? if it were me, i'd be on the other side of this.. i *hate* giving/receiving gifts.. the only difference between me and this guy is that i would never say i'm gonna give someone a gift in the first place.. if he got me a gift, i'd say ""ohh you didn't have to do that! aw, thank you! i feel terrible i didn't get you anything"" and that'd be the end of it.. if that happened several more times, honestly, i'd be as uncomfortable as he felt slighted, like.. he'd think ""why isn't she getting the hint that she should be getting me gifts"" and i'd think ""why isn't he getting the hint that i don't do gifts"".. that'd be an indication of incompatibility.. then if we have to have a conversation, depending on how compatible we are in the other areas, if he really expressed that he'd appreciate more gifts, i'd absolutely give in without question.. but if he says ""oh, i was just doing it because i thought you were supposed to but if you really don't care about gifts, giving or receiving, then we don't have to do that"", that'd be even better
honestly, i only like giving gifts if i know the person is going to like it.. like if there is something i know he's been eyeing for a while and a special occasion is coming up, i'd definitely get it.. if a special occasion wasn't coming up, i'd just get it as soon as i could if it was something i could afford readily.. gifts for the sake of gifts straight up makes me nauseous and gives me anxiety, giving and receiving.. to have it deemed as ""who would want to be with a person who doesn't give gifts on special occasions"" - i take that personally.. and i just really don't think that's a hard rule the way a lot of people here are making it out to be","does she really want to date someone who doesn't take the time to think ""hey maybe i should find my gf a gift like i told her i would for this major holiday that many many people give gifts for and my gf gave me one two years in a row"". even if he's not malicious, he's dense and the opposite of thoughtful - how far does this extend into their relationship? deal breaker."

my point though was a direct response to the comment saying icloud data isn't stored in the cloud and only locally. yes, backups are encrypted and barring a vulnerability in their verification and decryption protocol implementation, the backup data *should* be safe.","backups are encrypted. apple can give the fbi the encrypted file but neither party can access the contents.
any data that you could access through a web browser on [icloud.com]() can't be encrypted in order to allow you to access it, since apple's server needs to serve the data to you, so they have to be able to read it. that's the stuff being subpoenaed - photos mainly.

...
""""icloud content, as it exists in the customer's account"" can be handed over to law enforcement in response to a search warrant, apple's law enforcement guidelines read. that includes everything from detailed logs of the time, date and recipient of emails sent in the previous 25 days, to ""stored photos, documents, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, safari browsing history, maps search history, messages and ios device backups."" the device backup on its own may include ""photos and videos in the camera roll, device settings, app data, imessage, business chat, sms, and mms \[multimedia messaging service\] messages and voicemail"", according to apple.""","my husband is in it security and we went over it together. it's about as safe as it could possibly be. it's well encrypted, and apple doesn't have access to the data. even if they did they've protected user data against the government before."

it may not feel like it is worth it to you when you're not being appreciated, but it is worth it. don't let this negative experience stop you from helping others.","people ignore it often when people choose to be with someone abusive. because you call the cops on someone for beating his girlfriend and the cops show up and the girlfriend is defending the boyfriend, saying leave them alone, calling the person who called the cops an  and getting in their face about it.
that's the problem with abuse, people stay with their abusers and people who try to help them get pushed aside as interferring or all manor of other justifications.  sometimes they'll call you jealous or upset you don't have anyone and just trying to ruin their relationship.
i had to call the cops on the people in the apartment right by mine as after a week of partying noises and frustration it suddenly got way worse,  flying off balcony, sounded like a proper beatdown going on. called cops and they had to threaten to break in as the guy responsible locked himself in while the 'victim' had fled by then. turns out they managed to bend a steel bar reinforced door, smashed balcony window, one of them went through a table and a guitar and tv got thrown out the balcony.
pregnant girlfriend and his family stay there (despite accusations he beats her). a few weeks later i here another fight but the other guy had already moved out so it was the guy and his pregnant girlfriend. i heard what sounded like her saying ""i can't breathe, stop"" so i called the cops and went to knock on the door at the same time to try to stop him doing anything worse before cops got there.
she eventually left and i walked with her to her car, she was thankful but also made excuses for him, didn't stay to talk to cops (though they talked to her later).
cops basically couldn't do anything, the friend who got put through a table and door did nothing, she didn't leave and was back there the next day, all i got was the stink eye from both for calling cops.
that's the issue, you interfere and the abused dramatically more often than not stays with the abuser. you get emotionally invested, you feel responsible by calling the cops, you have to talk with cops and take the anger from the people you called the cops on and the result is usually that the abused gives you  as well as the abuser.

most of the time i never run into people again so i never know how things turned out. but at least two of those women did find me after and say it might have saved their lives. how is that not something worth doing, especially when all it costs are a few minutes on the phone?

"this still has nothing to do with what i said. stalking and obsessive exes are a major, massive issue, but one that is very difficult to deal with as laws aren't really designed to stop people who haven't broken significant laws. stalkers are an issue around the world because people who follow you and call your work, try to get you fired haven't broken any laws by doing so yet.
but again, that has nothing to do with anything i spoke about. leaving someone, leaving the house you live with your partner in and are in a relationship with is what i'm talking about. how you deal with an ex who won't leave you alone is a completely different situation. for one thing you have to leave said relationship and stop living them to be in the situation you're talking about.

eta: despite your dirty deleted you're still ignoring what i've said about laws that exist that aren't enforced. police and judiciary are the problem; they're protecting their rights to violence as they amplify perpetrator rights. silencing us won't make us go away. even when they  us there are always more survivors being denied.","> you clearly have no idea how abuse works. these women aren't staying by choice. abusers gaslight and brainwash their victims into thinking they have no other options.

my mom stopped slapping us and started throwing us against walls. neighbors made comments about how strict our household was.
she used to berate or pinch or slap. she started grabbing your hair and slamming heads against objects.
finally, she knocked my father down the basement steps and then went down and grabbed his head to smash it against the concrete floor. neighbors continued to laugh at my father. blaming him for the horrible abuse he constantly took. they would rather make jokes about his masculinity. they would rather watch this for decades.
i overheard gossip as they stood outside staring toward our house.
hoping one of the adults would know what to do. but all they ever did was ignore or mock our suffering.
calling the police on my own mother was so emotionally difficult. because the abuse teaches you to freeze or fawn to keep things peaceful. survival is protecting and coddling your abuser. if you can just be good enough, keep them happy and calm...well, if they get angry it's your fault. not theirs
living in abuse is a  up survival mentality
calling the police on her would be counter to survival. your whole body breaks down even considering such a betrayal. even if it's in defense of your siblings and father, the thing is their survival is also tied up in the abuser. your every instinct goes against protecting yourself.
i had to learn to discard wanting to survive. the hope for anything improving had to die entirely. and i was finally able to do something so traitorous as calling the police for help.
it was something i was only able to learn once i lost all trust in the community.
they knew. they did nothing.
neighbors looking the other way just means you are a silent audience to whatever comes next. maybe they leave. maybe someone ends up dead. but years of trauma will continue unchecked.

"right. i have a friend who was dating a girl a while back, and i suspected that she was abusing him. i knew him several years before he dated her, and we worked at the same place.
she told me that he was crazy, and abusive, and that he once put a cigarette out on her arm. normally if anyone were to hear that you'd be alarmed for the woman. but this one was different. she told me this almost.... gleefully? and he was sitting there right next to her, not saying anything. as time passed, my friend was becoming increasingly sullen at work. she called him almost daily, accusing him of cheating on her. he would complain about her spending all of the money he had put in their joint account.
one day we all went out to eat somewhere and i think she said something i disagreed with, and logically explained why, which probably made her feel . after that day, my friend started making excuses as to why he couldn't hang out after work anymore. on top of that, there were some other mutual friends they had that saw him as an abuser so they stopped hanging out with him. she was isolating him.
one day she texted me saying to stop giving advice to him. she claimed it was because his dad wanted them to only follow the advice of the couple's counselor they were supposedly both seeing.
i ended up messaging his dad on facebook, and he was aware that she wasn't all that she was cracked up to be, and asked me to support his son, which i was going to do anyway.
eventually they broke up, but was still wanting her to take him back. he was eventually served a restraining order. i went to the courtroom with him, but he accepted ended up not fighting it, and accepted the restraining order, which was the best thing he could have done. because now he legally had to stay away from her (and vice versa).","i know what they wrote, but apparently people can't read what i wrote.

you call and you get  from the abuser and the abused, you get emotionally involved, you get emotionally drained and hurt yourself so you learn not to bother interferring.","yep. i've been in this situation many times and not one person (neighbor, family member, housemate) ever called the cops. only one or two ever even mentioned it to me privately.
tbf, there is an idea out there that calling the police makes things worse for the victim, but i think most people just don't want to get involved or acknowledge bad things. weak."," your story is so harrowing. this could have been me. my ex used to always resort to strangling me. it was his mo.
no matter how loudly i screamed for help while trying to run away from him or talked about it with people practically begging for help, no one ever did. we even had roommates who knew and saw what was happening and would go in their room and lock the door rather than help or call the cops. only once out of 3 years did the cops ever get called and i found out the next day they went to the wrong place and didn't even follow up or try to find the true source.
people always talk big like if they heard or saw something they would do something. . no. not in my experience. the bystander effect is very real and people are very selfish.","this. so much this. when i was pregnant with my 2nd child, her dad would choke me unconscious in the front yard/driveway, or he would chase me and drag me back into the house. neighbors absolutely saw/heard. no one ever helped. not once.
i am currently in an undisclosed location with my 3rd child, running from her abusive dad. so, thank you so much for doing what you did.","thank you for calling the police.
i used to bartend years ago. i got a side gig catering rich peoples parties. after one, i got a call unreasonably early from my boss. he urgently wanted to know how much i'd served one particular couple. i hadn't served them much at all.
he got  and beat her to death later. she was screaming for help and nobody did.
you helped. not everyone does."
"from what i remember reading, the police were most likely called but simply ignored the 911 calls until it was too late to save her. police ignoring reports is a problem that continues to this day. many people have called the police for burglaries and assaults, yet the police never show up then claim they were never called.
there was even a recent case of a serial killer being captured after one of his victims escaped. multiple people reported telling the police that women were going missing, yet the police never investigated because they claimed that there were no missing person reports made. turns out, the police had been refusing to take missing person reports this entire time.","okay. two claimed to have called police during the attack. but the police had 0 record of those.
one person called out ""let that girl alone"".
only one person actually went to her...
and i'm guessing the ones who thought it was a domestic, probably didn't see it... only heard... because she was white and he was black, and it was 1964. even for nyc, i think that would have been an odd coupling for that time... i don't think interracial couples were that common...","tldr lots of people did not try to help.
only 2 called police... after she was basically dead... after a 70yo woman was the first to find her.
about a dozen saw or heard some sort of physical altercation.","the kitty genovese case. which was recently debunked - lots of people in fact tried to help.
i don't know why we discourage ourselves from mutual aid. well, i can think of a couple of reasons in western society. but in any case, it's nice that the evidence shows people can be awesome.","absolutely. doing everything they reasonably can to help. even if it inconveniences them by making them late for something... it's worth it when a life is potentially at stake. after all... maybe the abuser doesn't  the victim this time. but maybe they do next time, and next time they're quieter about it and it goes unnoticed.
i just think of the infamous bystander case mentioned in psych... where a woman was beaten (iirc to death?) in an alleyway, and not a single neighbor called the police... though several heard and/or saw it happening... one did shout out from their window. which briefly scared the guy off.
any neighbor could have likely gone outside, or grabbed something to use as a weapon, and simply scared the guy off with their presence. but no one did.","... or trying. we can't individually make them stop, but yes, everyone must try to support others who need help. otherwise what is the point of us?","this. in my experience, most people don't call. don't interfere. most people are not good people. a good person would interfere if able, or at least call and ensure the police found the right place and were able to intervene.
most people don't want to be bothered, tbh. and like to think of themseves as good because they would never beat their wife... but that's not all it takes to be good. being good also includes stopping people doing bad ."," your story is so harrowing. this could have been me. my ex used to always resort to strangling me. it was his mo.

"honestly, there's lots of articles out there with different information in each.
i highly doubt the podcast is likely to be the one sole source of information that's correct.... and even then, i doubt it would change my mind on the bystanders not doing enough.
as long as a few people knew there was a physical attack occurring, and none of them made any meaningful attempt to help... even check to make sure she got back inside safely. or keep calling the police until they got there.
then they didn't really do enough.","i would recommend listening to the you're wrong about podcast on kitty, as there are some wrong facts even in your current comment.","thanks for the link... i read up on it a bit more just now.
some people still saw her get stabbed, then stagger away out of view. none went outside to see if she was okay.
the people that saw the 2nd attack, after he returned to  and stab her more...
no one saw the full series of events. but about about a dozen people saw part of it.
two men were aware she was stabbed, one guy in the 1st attack. one guy was aware of the stabbing from the 2nd attack. but many more saw a woman getting beaten, some dismissed it as a ""lovers quarrel"". they didn't think a woman was being murdered, just another victim of domestic violence.
two of the 12 called police. only one person went outside, a 70yr old woman who held kitty as she died. after she was stabbed and .
i'm sorry but 2 people saw her get stabbed. one only called the police after she was basically dead, and the old lady found her and started shouting:
""intoxicated that night, ross heard noises and after deliberation, cracked open his door to investigate. he saw genovese laying on the ground, still alive and attempting to speak, and moseley stabbing her. he shut the door and called a friend to ask what to do. the friend said not to get involved.
ross eventually climbed out of his window and went to a neighbors apartment. he called the police after hearing sophie farrar call for someone to do so. ross' explanation--""i didn't want to get involved""--became the famous rejoinder of the bystander effect.""
i have to read up on this more... to see if the 2nd guy who saw her get stabbed did anything... different info in different articles...","the kitty genovese case. which was recently debunked - lots of people in fact tried to help.

"that's an interesting topic... thanks for the book recommendation, i might have to read it. there's definitely lots of bullying types in my workplace.
seems like it might the workplace version of a pdf i got on reddit : ""why does he do that"" by lundy bancroft. which focuses on abusive relationships iirc.
idk. a long time ago, in middle school... i found out another girl was being  by her father. i didn't tell a guidance counselor because i didn't want to make her situation worse. i've checked up on her facebook, and she seems to be well adjusted and living a happy life. but what if things turned poorly? she was always cutting her wrists (self harm, not suicidal)... what if she died? i probably would have regretted not speaking up. i'm glad she turned out okay. but i don't like to live with regrets, wondering if things would have turned out differently if i had just done something or said something.
i might regret it if i get seriously and permanently hurt trying to help someone. but i definitely will regret it if i provide 0 help. if that makes sense.","of course.
there's an interesting book, *nasty people and how to avoid being hurt by them.* (i think. it's been a while) it's more about manipulative workplace bully types, not physical abuse. but the lesson is the same - why do people say/do nasty things? one main reason is because they don't feel good about themselves, and they boost their own self-esteem by putting others down. for the physically abusive, this means inflicting hurt so they can feel that they are superior, because deep down they know or suspect they are less than others and can ""prove"" this is not so by being the physically dominant.","if they're gonna hurt a victim for someone trying to save them, they were going to hurt the victim anyways.
interfering doesn't change anything when you have someone violent who is looking for an excuse to abuse.
ie. the abuser will say ""i'm only doing this because you tried to escape"". but if they didn't try to escape? then the abuser will say ""i'm only doing this because you didn't wash the dishes"".
it's like how a cheater will always cheat... an abuser will always abuse. they just make up excuses and find anything wrong so they can try to explain their behavior. when deep down it's just that they're  up.","very good points.
except - nowadays, a bully knows the power of a phone and will see any move to call, record, or whatever as a provocative move. and, they are unpredictable. stand well back, be ready to run.
i'm an average height, slightly(?) overweight guy - but i haven't been in a serious fight since grade school. i seriously doubt i could take on some guy who has a habit of physical violence and a berserker attitude where they could be aggressive without regard to themselves getting hurt. i don't want to find out the hard way, because if i lose the victim- if they don't want to leave - is no better off than when i started. most likely worse, now the guy is angrier. ""see what trouble you brough onto me!!??""","calling 911 takes less than a minute, assuming you know where you are. (and you should always know where you are tbh, pay attention to street names and businesses nearby... or look for a nearby house #).
then hit record on your phone. to get video of the person and what they look like. what they're doing.
telling them you called the police and are recording them will often get some to stop without a physical altercation.
it can be a bit more obvious if they're on drugs or ... in that case just keep your distance.
it shouldn't be too hard to outrun a  if you're in even half decent shape.
i'm a petite woman who weighs just over 100lbs. doesn't mean i would just run and hope the police or someone else did something. if i get hurt. then i get hurt. but at least i wasn't a coward who stood by and didn't even try to help someone being actively hurt.
granted, physically interfering depends case by case. if you see a stranger attacking someone for no reason (ie a random street attack or something), then take into account, can you and the victim handle the stranger? are there any makeshift weapons you can use nearby?
domestics are a bit different. because the victim has to be the one to want to leave. and if they aren't ready to leave their abuser, they'll likely attack you or get mad at you for interfering. and let's be real, there are very few cases where a woman is being locked in a house and 100% unable to physically leave. they usually stay out of a misguided sense of love. and repeatedly willingly go back home to their abuser.","the problem is... what are you going to do? the aggressor is likely , and obviously acting irrationally. unless you're the type who can definitely win a no-hold-barred bar fight, the moment you get involved you put yourself at risk.
calling the police is obviously the best idea. however, you are dealing with an irrational violent person. if you even open your door or knock on theirs to tell him off, and then the police show up, he may simply blame the person who told him off. just call the police and let them handle it.","this. in my experience, most people don't call. don't interfere. most people are not good people. a good person would interfere if able, or at least call and ensure the police found the right place and were able to intervene.

"hmm indeed, i always thought that mu expectations are too high but in the end this is what i want.. thanks for sharing your thoughts.. i will contemplate on my relationship because that seem to be the issue","there's a difference between giving him a chance to change with grace and patience and waiting too long for him to change in ways he has no interest in changing. 10 years is a *long* time, and it's highly unlikely anything about the relationship will change significantly after so much time and you telling him what you need.

"thank you for this. it's very easy to say ""no sane person would do something like that"", but these guys don't behave like someone who's (medically) delusional. they're angry, filled with hate, lacking respect and remorse, and convinced that their reasons are justifiable, but they know it's  and do not care.","yep. logically, extreme violence is an indicator that the perpetrator **is not** mentally ill, so they should be handled with a level of wariness that **exceeds** that used around people who are genuinely mentally ill.
the violent perpetrator has the greater capacity to assess, plan, mislead, and enact violence - a true and ongoing threat to anyone who gets close enough.
people are unsettled by the perception of unpredictability in a mentally ill person, but perceived threat does not translate to actual threat. the average person wants to think that a sane person (as they think they themselves are) is not capable of such brutality. spolier: some humans just .

"i remember watching a true crime doc about a teenage girl who lured a 12yo girl into her car and took her out to this place in the woods and brutally tortured her before killing her. and unsurprisingly it turned out her parents had done some truly horrifying things to her throughout her short life. it made me so sad that the teenage girl, though she was the one who actually did the horrible acts to the other girl, was to be punished for the rest of her life because of what her parents had done to her. it disturbed me that her parents wouldn't even get punished for what they did either. our society is all about pointing the finger and calling it justice and then we're shocked that horrible things keep happening. i think people have a hard time understanding that trying to help, to rehabilitate, to prevent, to teach, etc. is not the same as excusing horrible actions.
i'm very sorry about your uncle.","people are so supportive of trauma victims--until they admit to committing some heinous crime during a trauma response, that is. once victim becomes victimizer we call them depraved monsters. my dad used to say your empathy isn't worth much if you can only empathize with people you understand, and i think that applies here. i really don't think anyone *set outs* to become a sociopath.
i'll never forget my mom telling me about my kind and mind-mannered uncle coming back from vietnam asa very young man and maniacally running down a dog in the road. he later said he couldn't clearly recall the incident, and was really disturbed by it happening. he also experienced what everyone called ""extreme fits of jealousy"" when he later married the love of his life, a widow to a young man who died in vietnam, whose photos he would violently smash while hyperventilating. it seemed clear to me that there was a  of a lot more to it than just ""jealousy"".
i've been in relationships with people who were badly abused as children and have seen a couple different versions of trauma responses. when that  hits, i really don't think people have control. they become strangers to me, but also to themselves. these were people whose abuse ended by elementary school yet it clearly affected them deeply. even with a therapist, with family support and a very motivated individual, it is really, really hard to undo that damage. and most people aren't getting any of that.
i'm fairly sure there are statistics on this and the fact is that a significant portion of violent offenders in prison have experienced significant trauma. you can absolutely  basic human development, like self-regulation and empathy, with the right combo of trauma and lack of support.
eta: and i honestly don't know why people act like suggesting there could be some reason humans seem more capable of heinous violence in some geographic regions vs others is ""letting people off"", but i suspect it had something to do with the ""justice=punishment"" mindset that puts dangerous people in concrete boxes with each other so they can become even more poorly-suited due release into society.","i don't want to argue with you because i've got the whole gamut of mental illness myself, but it is very very common for abusers to have been abused themselves. they are often mentally ill. well-adjusted people do not abuse others. and pointing out the mental damage that using violence as punishment for children causes can help teach folks to stop doing stuff like that. in general i don't think acknowledging the mental health of violent and abusive people is meant to demonize everyone with mental illness as violent, it's more so acknowledging that being violent is not normal and it often occurs because of abuse by caregivers.","thank you!

in this particular case, i think only you can make this decision. like you mentioned, i don't know if your past  trauma is leaking into this situation or if you genuinely don't trust your sa with  anymore. look deep within yourself and decide how you feel about the whole thing and go from there. don't listen to all of us as only you can gauge whether he is being genuinely sincere and whether you can move past this.

"oh my , that's horrifyingly",the reports that a record number of teenaged girls are being admitted to the hospital for  tears makes me deeply uncomfortable and sad,"this. you immediately get branded as not being  positive if you want to have a frank discussion about the increasing misogyny in  or the  crowd (which seems like everyone now.) i have a teen niece who talks to me, and know that so many of these girls believe that they have to do anything a boy wants to be desirable, even if it feels terrible. 90% of the  online these days is extremely degrading to women, and this is mainstream now, not even seen as kink. violently skull f'ing, hair pulling, spitting on women, calling them , slapping their faces, coming on their faces/tongues, etc. is all totally normalized as mainstream, not even branded as kink. i'm  positive, but i think a lot of girls have been bamboozled into accepting  aggression and misogyny by shaming them for supposedly not being  positive or cool if they don't want to be treated like garbage cans. somehow i feel like our feminism has been used against us in today's culture to trick us into doing  that feels degrading and painful. i'm uncomfortable with the turn it has taken.
i can't help but think of armie hammer, using the guise of  to  and abuse very young women, telling them they don't need a safe word and they belong to him to do anything he wants with them, burning them, carving his initials in their skin, biting them, beating them, choking them, all without explicit consent, going well beyond their limits and providing no aftercare when he left them behind, bleeding and severely bruised. all of that was done in the name of kink, and he thinks that just because he talked them into being tied up, that they no longer could withdraw consent for any act he chose to do to them. each of those girls describes feeling totally confused and violated, but not having had the language to explain at the time how he  them when they agreed to  and even , but not the extreme violence that he escalated it to without their consent.","i try to be -positive and i get that  is a thing but i wish we could have an honest conversation about whether a bunch of the men ""into bdsm"" that hurts/dominates women could just be violent misogynists who use kink to excuse their impulses","guys who hurt you during  actually just want to hurt you.

i agree that her handling that situation was the best course of action, but sadly could have turned out differently if paul had lashed out.  op needs to keep an eye on paul just in case he decides to retaliate later perhaps she should go to hr if she hasn't yet.","i don't know. allowing her to handle the situation can also show that they didn't want to imply she needed a rescue.
her handling it herself changed his behavior in a way another man interfering probably wouldn't've.",">men could have shoved him away
op, beware of these others as much as paul. they either don't have a problem/share his mindset and are simply more risk averse, or they're indifferent cowards who won't do a thing to stand up for you.
this  should have been cut short by them at the first comment, anything short is fostering a predatory environment.","the fact that you had to slap him just to have the *immense privilege* of not feeling violated by a creep treating you like a walking commodity... men could have shoved him away, women have to resort to this because we're weaker and get no respect whatsoever. it's so sad that some people need to be bodily shaved away before learning to keep their hands to themselves."

this is one of those things that many people, men and women, will try to invalidate your feelings on. they will try to make it seem less severe because they want it to be. but it doesn't change reality and you need to listen to yourself better and not let others' convince you it isn't a serious issue.

exactly! - thanks for helping me clarify,"okay, sorry i misunderstood. i totally thought you were saying that this was women's fault for not leaving when they saw this.
but now i get you're just saying we should hold men to a higher standard. especially at the beginning of the relationship. which i totally agree with.
like, it's not cute that you still send your laundry gone for your mom to do - it's ridiculous.","i honestly think we agree on this. i absolutely think it's a men problem! i'm sorry if i framed it as only a woman's issue. and i can definitely empathize with people whose partners change late in the relationship and stop caring, as well as how difficult divorce must be.
your examples were good and i didn't mean to dismiss them - it's more nuanced than i made it seem.
i guess my thoughts were more directed at newer relationships where it becomes obvious that you're dating a man child and it's easier to walk away.","i'm saying it's not an option because you don't know until it's very late in the relationship. and yes, you can divorce someone over their housework division, but most of the time, women are told that there aren't any men that are going to do it any better so she should just be happy with the one she has.
i also like that you're framing this as a women's issue when it is absolutely something that men should address.","i appreciate all the examples, but it really does boil down to: you get what you tolerate. and it often really is that simple. being able to communicate like an adult and being willing and able to walk away are really the only other requirements that come to play in your examples.
edit: a lot of women don't have the options we have in the us, but for most of us - just don't marry or have kids with someone who can't do housework like an adult
edit2 lol: i disagree about ""not an option"" - barring extreme circumstances, you choose your partners! and no, i don't think breaking up over something like someone being unwilling to contribute to housework is strange at all","that's not always an option. haven't you ever had a roommate or anything who for the first year (or months) was great and took out the trash and always cleaned their dishes and such - and then after a while devolved and it strained your relationship?
or, you're dating someone, and when everything's good, you're great, but a stressor happens and then the relationship changes because you never went through any relationship-testing events earlier in the relationship?
also, if you straight up ask many people, i'm sure they'd say - yes, i'm going to carry my own weight. but then you have kids, and they're tired after a long day of work, and slowly but surely they push work off onto their spouse. and you're not going to divorce just because of that - especially if you've got kids. but you may get to a point where your spouse only does things if you remind them - and then, you're either the nagging spouse or you get overwhelmed by the chores and blow up and then you expected him to read your mind.
additionally, that doesn't solve the issue that women shouldn't have to interrogate men and come up with scenarios to see if they'll pull their own weight. we're gonna have to make it work so that's the expectation.
and a lot of women don't even know to look for that. before i left home - i thought everyone could do certain things. then when i got to college i realized that (both women and men) were lacking housework skills. women might just expect that men will pull their own weight and dive into a relationship. in my catholic family, you're basically a  if you live with your bf pre-marriage (i don't subscribe to that idea but just giving an example of a cultural norm). so she's never lived with him, and now they're married and divorce is frowned upon and she learns that he won't keep up his half without nagging which he'll blame her for.
that doesn't even touch on the fact that we're still at a point where men generally have a higher pay then their spouse and that often gets held over their heads. even if they spend the same amount of time at work.
so yes, it would be great if we could just avoid those men, but it's not always possible, and sometimes you don't see that side of them until it's late.
plus, there is tremendous pressure for women to settle so that they can get married. imagine she's been dating someone for years and they finally move in together. he's nice and funny and good-looking and whatever. but she notices that he never puts his dishes away and she's always the one to vacuum and whatever. she might complain about that to her friends - but a lot of the time that wouldn't be an immediate dealbreaker. they'd say - at least he's not abusing you or cheating etc. and breaking up over some dishes seems strange right?
but then they have kids, and the burden of domestic work for her increases exponentially and all the little things build. again, she's trapped in the - do i become the nagging wife that he makes jokes about hating all the time or do i keep this to myself and become overwhelmed with work?",that is a fixable problem - stop choosing partners that don't pull their own weight with housework.,"that is absolutely true, and working women end up doing most of the housework anyway so the workload is becoming even more unequal in a lot of households."

"that's pretty much saying it is up to women to fix the problem, it is not and never should be.
i grew up seeing my mum work long hours so i made an effort to clean and cook for myself. my dad is from a very traditional family but i even saw him help around the house and he worked crazy hours. i think one thing they both instilled in me was just accepting basic responsibities. if the lawn is looking overgrown, get lawn mower out. if the floor is dirty get the vacuum or mop. if there are dirty clothes wash them. if you are hungry then cook something. it's all basic stuff. i find it bizare that many men cannot pick it up though i have known many women for who such concepts are equally as bizare.

i absolutely agree with you.,"that's part of the problem - if women communicate that they are unhappy with the amount of housework their so is doing - they're often seen as 'nagging wives'
on top of that, it's still work to have to remind your so to do basic chores. you shouldn't have to communicate - clean up your own dishes - because that should be something he already does. yet it's still seen as ""women are so mysterious and expect you to read their minds"" when they just want you to do the basics without having to remind you every time.
she's not his mother.
women shouldn't have to ask for 50/50. men should step up and do 50/50 no matter what.","it's called ""communication"". a lot of men just don't realize they aren't actually being helpful.","not a joke at all. most men do not pull their weight with domestic labor or childcare (or elder care, for that matter). i'm not sure how you think women are supposed to find the few men who truly will, particularly when they're outnumbered by those who won't. it's not even necessarily an intention thing - many men *think* they're putting in equal effort when they are not. they often underestimate what it takes to run a household and care for children.","i'm assuming you're making a joke? because there are men out there that will split housework, and it's up to women not to put up with ones that don't.",straight women do not choose to be heterosexual.,that is a fixable problem - stop choosing partners that don't pull their own weight with housework.,"that is absolutely true, and working women end up doing most of the housework anyway so the workload is becoming even more unequal in a lot of households."

"ok, but wouldn't you have to stay at 1500 cal to maintain even if you had never been overweight?
that's what i'm asking.","i know i can never go back to eating what i want. since i'm short and losing weight very slowly at calories a day, i'll probably hopefully be able to eat 1500 cal to maintain.
yes. i will forever have to eat less to maintain. this is correct.","> you will forever have to eat less to maintain than if you had never been obese.
why? does the body 'get used to' being overweight and does some weird metabolism stuff differently?","sadly being  is the last 'acceptable' reason to mock people.
i say good on you. 50 is a serious accomplishment!! losing weight is almost unsurmountabley difficult. and its not like once it's off you can eat a 'normal' amount if you have been obese. you will forever have to eat less to maintain than if you had never been obese. it sucks.","it takes a  of a lot of effort. i've lost 50 and live life day to day at a caloric deficit. my body doesn't want to do it. but my will power has been strong enough this time for some reason.
thing is, i'm still . so i get those lazy assumptions that idgaf about my health even though i'm 220 days into this battle and have at least that much to go.
what can i do though? i'm not changing anyone's mind.","if losing weight was only a matter of a 'little self care' we wouldn't have the obesity rates we do.
source: i've lost 109 pounds. it is not a matter of a little effort.",not that it is right but some people feel if you don't care about your health why should they. those people probably shouldn't be doctors but it can be frustrating to see so many sick with things they could prevent with a little self care.,this is called diagnostic overshadowing and it's a real problem in medicine. also people sadly just don't care as much about  people.

"snickerdoodle, those are all little kids. the oldest one is maybe, what, 13?
i've had meltdowns like the last two videos as well. i made a comic about one of my triggers if you want to see it. i went to a segregated school for about two years and was in special ed for longer. at the segregated school they used restraints and isolation rooms and i can tell you outright they abused them to their fullest. they told our parents it was to ""calm the kids down"" but who the  calms down from being forcibly restrained?
people grabbing their childrens face and restraining them and otherwise antagonizing them for the camera is basically never going to calm someone down when they're having a meltdown.
there's a huge difference between a 5-year-old with ""~severe~!"" autism and that same adult 20 years later, particularly if that adult isn't isolated and prevented from finding communication methods that work for them.
i mean my special ed teacher tried really hard to make sure i stayed in special ed as much as humanly possible. any time i had a meltdown or a bad day at school she'd record it. and she'd show it at my iep meetings. and she'd tell every staff member who interacted with me in the building. she wanted me in special ed for a minimum of 2 hours a day. i have no idea *why* but she did. and she could make me sound like i really had no ability to function at all...all she had to do was spend 3 years taking away every healthy coping mechanism i had (drawing, mild stimming, seating myself so sensory disorder wasn't as much of a problem in class, wearing sunglasses, etc) and antagonizing me and she created a profile that sounded like a very low functioning individual.
then i think of people like my younger brother, who is nonverbal and at one point had and used a speech aid until it was repeatedly taken away because he used it ""too much."" he won't use a similar aid to communicate now. i've found i can draw a flow-chart if i need to ask him something and that works, but imagine how much easier if people had decided they were just glad he was communicating than taking away his talker because he asked for cookies one too many times.

also- i hit a very low point emotionally with covid too.

""tell her to take that  down."" his words echo over and over.
thank you for commenting. it feels relieving that i'm not alone in being upset over it. thank you.",all good. i just got mad the way he treated you like that when grief stricken. sending internet hugs.,"my spouse says the same thing. my brother is older than me by 16 years. long story short - my dad was married and had his son. a decade and a half later, he met my mom and i was the ""accident"" child. he lived with us until i was 5, 6 years old. he moved back in with his first wife but they told me he just lived at work. i found out i had a brother and my dad lived with his first wife when i was 11 years old. anyways, his first wife died when i was 16 and then my parents got back together when i was 17. they are 20 years apart. it's a weird and strange story to explain but for the last 16 years they have been so happy together. my mom is in isolation right now and completely heartbroken.
i started to ramble - sorry.
i know my brother takes advantage of things and even does it with my spouse (the wi-fi thing as an example). i just have never been close to him and as i got older, i started to do anything and everything to try and become part of his family. when i worked at disney, i would get them all into the parks. or if the kids needed photos for graduation, birthdays, etc, he knew i had photography equipment made for weddings. i thought doing all of this stuff would help get us closer. but we are still not close and i honestly think he resents me. i know he does my mother. but i think he resents me too.","> he will come to us if he needs something
that's just another way to say he's a leech.","i know. i got upset when he called my spouse, telling him to, ""tell her to take that  down right now."" i understand that he wanted me to remove it from facebook because he didn't want his kids to see when driving home from work, but i thought since my twitter was private, it would be okay to turn there for help. my spouse is amazing and listens to me and allows me to vent, yes, but i just.. i was hoping to reach out to anyone across the internet to.. to talk to. i don't know how to word it, but i think you know what i mean.
my spouse texted my brother after that phone call and tried to stand up for me. my brother is just the very - he has to be in control type. we are not close at all and typically he will come to us if he needs something. his wi-fi isn't great at his new house or he wants to take the family to orlando and needs a discount or to see if i had any hook ups (i've used hotel points for him multiple times before) or if my hospital has any entry level jobs for one of his kids. stuff like that. so i probably should have known better than to post on social media. in the back of my head i knew i would get in trouble.
i'm going to wait until the end of the weekend to post anywhere else. i'm just glad i could post here. it makes things feel less alone. i have a three year old and i have to compose myself as best as i can around him. he grasps some of what is going on.. but it's hard to explain and for him to understand. so having this safe space and everyones kindness is amazing. thank you again for reading and your time and everything. thank you, thank you.","your brothers behavior is heartbreaking, irresponsible, and downright cold. i'm really sorry, but he doesn't have the right to tell you to take your grief down. you have every right to feel what you feel and talk about it in any manner you need to. he put himself first, and that's sickening. again, i'm sorry.

that's not much different than telling a woman she has to be a mother because she got pregnant. both sexes should have the right to chose whether or not they become legal parents,i didn't say any such thing. do whatever the  you want as long as there's mutual consent. just know that it is the woman's decision to terminate and make your decision to come inside of her accordingly.,but isn't that just controlling people's  lives by telling them what they can and cannot do in the bedroom?,what a colossal failure of imagination! there's plenty of  to be had without  inside of her.,"isn't that the pro-life argument?

on the same principle, i also believe that if a man does not want a child and the woman wants it, then he should be given an option to lose all rights and duties over it - it is equally unfair that a woman should be able to impose such a life-changing consequence upon a man when it is avoidable.","i use birth control because i have tumors growing inside and outside my  (endo).

he was ok by the next day. i have no idea what was going on, but the experience left us both scarred.",yes,was this in the u.s.?,right? its unbelievable how differently this could have turned out,[removed]

"insurance companies deny adult humans' applications for insurance policies all the time.
you do not win any prizes from your local insurance company for being considered an alive human. maybe a spam marketing mail. that's it.

end of story.","the insurance company is not trying to define when the ""fetus"" became a ""baby.""
insurance policies are legal contracts, with very clear terms. the insurance company writes up _a contract_ to pay out only if the baby survives the entire 14 day period starting at birth. the insurance company cares zero whether that human is called a baby, a fetus, whatever. it is not eligible for a claim on the policy unless it lives 14 days after birth. end of story. calling it a baby or not, is 100% irrelevant to that clearly stated provision of the contract.","yes, but if it is a baby 6 weeks after conception, it cannot not be a baby after that and then become a baby again 14 days after birth.","sorry for the following semantics.. but if it is considered a baby a 6 weeks after conception... then it can also be a baby at 14 days after birth... so... it can be both... i guess all you need to amend would be to add is ""begins being considered"" before ""a baby"" and then the sentiment hold.... again... sorry for the semantics... i couldn't help myself.

i don't want to leave my religion (roman catholic) just because theirs is effed. do i have to be against religion to be against religious abuse?,"op, i am so, so sorry to hear this. my heart is breaking for you and your kids.
i'm not surprised at all that they're ifb (independent fundamental baptist). child abuse, and subsequent victim blaming, demon blaming, and rug sweeping are everywhere in that group. i grew up fundamentalist too, and unfortunately i know this first hand.
i'm not sure how you process, but if you want support from a group who has gone through the same sort of religious abuse, try the sub edenexodus. they also have a podcast that i've found helpful as i process and heal, so maybe it would help you too.
you are such a wonderful mom, and i have huge respect for the way you're protecting your kids. love and hugs x
i wish i could do more, but you're welcome to dm me if there's any way i can support you.","they are fundamental baptist, and demon possession seems to be the go-to excuse for anything not in line with their unreasonably (in my opinion) hard religious rules they follow. there is no real personal responsibility.","not heard about the demonic possession (not from us) but the ""hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil"" is recurring theme for many abuse stories alongside with punishing whistleblowers. alongside with trivialization, victim blaming (stories about children 'tempting' poor priests , explanation of children enraging parents and 'forcing' them to discipline them etc.). it happens over and over in child abuse,  harassment (see #metoo) etc. i wouldn't be surprised if mil told your daughter that your daughter will get into trouble if she tell you something.","is this seriously a thing? i don't even know for sure but it never even crossed mind not to believe my child. how could anyone not 100% support their child over an abusive adult!? i guess somewhere inside i know it happens, i just can't wrap my head around it. my kids are always my first priority. eff every one else.",sounds sadly typical.,"when the two siblings came forward with allegations as teenagers, they disclosed to their youth pastor. their father, the youth pastor, and the senior pastor of the church all were dismissive of the allegations, went so far as to tell the kids they should recant and say they only made allegations because of demonic influences, and then it was all swept under the rug via a strict ""we just don't talk about this"" policy. that's why no charges were pressed at the time, and now the statute of limitations has expired. so i could see some merit to what you're saying given how that was handled.",">like, i'm seriously trying to think of any way i can justify or defend this. make it make sense.
i will preface that you need to, of course, do what is best for your children.
as for your husband - i will note that it sounds like he grow up in abusive household and might have been abused himself. he might not remember/believe and not want to remember/believe which is why he forgot to mention it to you - i was abused, though not sexually and not by my parents, in this age and i just remember flashbacks. if my parents tried to convince me that it didn't happened instead of being livid at perpetrator/sorry that it happened they probably could.
i don't know what you should do but i can understand your husband. this is not the same as excuse but it sounds like he needs therapy to come to terms with his childhood. weather or not you and your children should be there in meantime is another matter.
i'm really sorry for what your daughter and you need to live through. i second u/raaahhhhhh about child abuse therapy."

i'm genuinely really sorry that you have that unfortunate knowledge. good luck and i'm sure whatever you decide will be what's best for your daughter.,the reason i was a single mom was because my children and i were domestic violence victims. i am unfortunately very well versed in filing all of the appropriate police reports and medical evaluations and keep a safe file in a safety deposit box with all of my forms and papers. this is how their biological father has no parental rights.,agree it's definitely possible he repressed trauma or was taught to normalize it. therapy stat to talk this out. i'd also file a police report on this. it may be enough with her pay history to keep her from unsupervised visits.,"i have to disagree with who you responded to. i was abused myself and abuse can effect memory in weird ways. if your husband never dealt with his own trauma, well that might be why he doesn't understand the gravity of this omission.",i so desperately want there to be some valid explanation.,all i can say is there's no way he forgot. he had to have intentionally withheld this information.,"like, i'm seriously trying to think of any way i can justify or defend this. make it make sense. but i can't. i have nothing. how do i ever trust this man again?",that is need to know information. he  up majorly. this could be a deal breaker. don't let him trivialize this.

context: we talked a bit while hanging out with a mutual friend. afterwards she found me on facebook, asked if i had anything to do on sunday (ex had broken up with me the day before) and so i said, not really, we could meet up. we talked a bit and i had a looming feeling she didn't ask to meet me bcz she wanted to be just friends, and i was kinda lonely, so i asked that.
now happily in a relationship since two months. :p",i think that's super romantic and would have loved to be asked like that!,"sure is.
i mean my journey with my current gf started by me asking ''would you like to cuddle''.
then again i am on the autistic spectrum so talking straight is my mojo. yes, i do have a vested interest in all this.","it's definitely happening more now as compared to, say, 50 years ago.","yeah. in general it would help a ton that we remove the 'playing games' from romance altogether.
a monumental cultural change is needed for that. i shall hope it happens in my lifetime.","it would be nice if the 'moral majority' stopped telling girls to just say no. if we tell girls to say no when they want to say yes, then tell men to just try harder when they get told no , you promote  coercion. we should not be teaching men that when a woman says no she doesn't mean it, and we need girls to stop playing games that play into that scenario.",would be nice if the ''hard-to-get'' stereotype just vanished into thin air.,definitely. add to that that too many women say 'no...' but actually mean that they want you to put in more effort in pursuing them. the self-aware or insecure guys then tend to play it safe and assume she indeed means no. the impetuous guys then keep pushing and only stop after several no's.
"i'm a really tall dude (204cm) and people in school were always trying to convince me to pick up someone else who's on the smaller side. like, the one requesting didn't want to be picked up, they wanted someone else picked up. and i was always like, no i'm not gonna do that. for one, me and that other person are not circus animals to be used to entertain you. beyond that the other person didn't ask to be picked up. i have no idea if they'd be okay with that.
there have also been times people have tried picking *me* up just because i'm so large. so they see it as a challenge similar to when they pick you up. so i can definitely relate on that part.","yup. it started in middle school. we were assigned to be reading buddies for the younger kids and even elementary and middle school kids would all try and see if they could pick me up because i was ""so small"" for an 8th grader. the side effect being i've never felt safe in my body. i didn't break 5' until high school.","oh my , that's horrible! i didn't realize that was a thing that happens to petite women. i'm so sorry. it's such a violation of your autonomy!","this. a man picked me up even when i told him not to, we were ""all friends."" and he was so  he fell over. lucky for him i broke his fall. unlucky for me i got a black eye and several lacerations and abrasions, and a scar on my face. i can't  stand the entitlement some men have just because i'm small. people pick me up as if i were the human equivalent of a chihuahua. i've taken up mixed martial arts and really worked on my ""don't mess with me"" vibes. but still. wish i didn't have to. wish people just respected others space and wishes to be left alone.","yes! i am a tall, meaty woman. one time one of my friends (a guy about your size) was messing around and picked me up clean off the ground when i wasn't expecting it.
i felt real fear. it was a reminder that even though i'm not particularly small, someone could overpower me by surprise, in an instant.
thank you for getting it.","i am 6'3 and 300 lbs. i recognize this privilege and i can't even imagine what it would be like to be threatened by someone a foot taller than me and nearly twice my weight, so i'm gone  now.","i took a self defense class once and was literally told sometimes you have to ""take the rape"" to get out safely. it was described as a tool of self defense. i am really surprised how often men don't understand the reality of these situations.","having taken a self defense course, specifically for women and in an urban area we were taught in that course that compliance and surrender are also forms of self defense. this makes me so mad that people can't figure this out.
you are alone with someone who has obviously no qualms about hurting you or taking what they want by force. could i fight? sure! is it the best option? only the person in that situation gets to decide.
anyone who has had to physically fight off aggressors (bigger than you) can probably attest to how terrifying and exhausting it is. that's the truly scary part.

any way, in highschool at a dance a guy friend, whose a full foot taller than i am, decides it would be a great idea to pick me up. i freaked and literally wrapped my arms around my other smaller guy friend next to me. this  kept trying to lift me up while i was attached to this other guys neck basically and yelling at him to stop picking me up cause i didn't want him to. he didn't stop til my guy friend told him to stop. no idea why he thought ""hey i'll keep trying even tho she's flipping out and screaming at me!"" was a good plan. this all happened with in like a minute, so smaller guy friend didn't wait long to speak up on my behalf thank .","yup. it started in middle school. we were assigned to be reading buddies for the younger kids and even elementary and middle school kids would all try and see if they could pick me up because i was ""so small"" for an 8th grader. the side effect being i've never felt safe in my body. i didn't break 5' until high school.","oh my , that's horrible! i didn't realize that was a thing that happens to petite women. i'm so sorry. it's such a violation of your autonomy!","this. a man picked me up even when i told him not to, we were ""all friends."" and he was so  he fell over. lucky for him i broke his fall. unlucky for me i got a black eye and several lacerations and abrasions, and a scar on my face. i can't  stand the entitlement some men have just because i'm small. people pick me up as if i were the human equivalent of a chihuahua. i've taken up mixed martial arts and really worked on my ""don't mess with me"" vibes. but still. wish i didn't have to. wish people just respected others space and wishes to be left alone.","yes! i am a tall, meaty woman. one time one of my friends (a guy about your size) was messing around and picked me up clean off the ground when i wasn't expecting it.
i felt real fear. it was a reminder that even though i'm not particularly small, someone could overpower me by surprise, in an instant.
thank you for getting it.","i am 6'3 and 300 lbs. i recognize this privilege and i can't even imagine what it would be like to be threatened by someone a foot taller than me and nearly twice my weight, so i'm gone  now.","i took a self defense class once and was literally told sometimes you have to ""take the rape"" to get out safely. it was described as a tool of self defense. i am really surprised how often men don't understand the reality of these situations.","having taken a self defense course, specifically for women and in an urban area we were taught in that course that compliance and surrender are also forms of self defense. this makes me so mad that people can't figure this out.
you are alone with someone who has obviously no qualms about hurting you or taking what they want by force. could i fight? sure! is it the best option? only the person in that situation gets to decide.
anyone who has had to physically fight off aggressors (bigger than you) can probably attest to how terrifying and exhausting it is. that's the truly scary part.

"as someone from a  up family heres my two cents. shes still a bit too young, but in 3 or four years this will be aplicable; dont bring it up first hand, but if she asks, try to be honest without going into too much detail. if the divorce is recent shes still probably pretty raw and desperately trying to find some way to repair things and thats really not the time to bring up stuff like this. but in a few years the most extreme feelings about it have calmed down, she'll have matured quite a bit and when you feel shes ready i wouldnt keep the truth from her.
of course im not a psychologist so i have no idea if this is truly the best way to go about it but its how i was treated and i will always appreciate it, because i could feel myself there was something not quite right with my toxic family member but i would never have had the courage to distance myself without my grandma being honest when i asked as a teenager cause i wouldve thought it was just in my head and i was acting crazy and dramatic, which i wasnt.",">when he is old enough to understand and process the distress these stories generate in any feeling human being, you should share some of them with him too.

free the  goes well beyond posting a picture on instagram. it seeks to reject female objectification, and it seeks to put men and women on more equal footing.

"don't make a straw man argument. i never said patriarchy, and i'm not talking about feminism.
please understand the difference between something being culturally inappropriate, and illegal.
that difference is massive, there is simply no comparison.
it might be culturally inappropriate for men to wear women's clothing, but they are not fined for it. yes there are differences between men and women, and that's fine, culture is what it is, and i feel it should be respected. but that's a choice, not a legal command.","except... men and women are different.
you can replace the word 'women' with 'people' and it would still be historically accurate.
you call this enemy ""the patriarchy"" aka boogeyman 3.0.
men can show their  in certain situations because in our society, dicks, ,  and vaginas are indications for  attention or desire. it's not like guys are going to go around exposing their  for the fun of it... nor should we?
women can also wear men's clothing without giving off any weird social vibes whatsoever. the same cannot be said for men. why? because we're different.
we evolved to complete different tasks, so that we could work together, not copy what each other does.
you keep referring to an enemy or a person in power. conspiracy theories can only go so far with circular logic.
""this is why you always push beyond what is strictly necessary/fair/we don't want to meet them in the middle"" goes with the saying ""you give an inch, they take a mile"". quite the truthful description of what feminism is aiming to do.","you are not getting it. this is the same as the conservative homosexual asking other  why the pride parade has to be so ""out there"" with dudes wearing diapers while riding a giant . ""isn't it enough that they no longer  us for being who we are?"" he might ask.
but they make fools of themselves (while having fun) because when it comes to freedom and equality, you don't compromise. it's all of it, and we are not asking.
women in the west don't have freedom, they fought for it. the suffrejets that got them the vote faced vile opposition, but their daughters gets to consider voting a natural right because of them.
well that struggle never ends, that's the truth, it's constantly on going. and it's against an enemy that has an issue with female sexuality, sexuality in general, and most likely their own sexuality. there is no room for compromise here, either women have the same freedoms as men, or you fight for what you don't have.
if men can show their , then women need to be able to as well. it might seem pretty to you, since there are worse things women go through in the world, and that's understandable. but think about why it is somehow illegal for women to show their . what kind of a person makes that opposite argument?
a person in power. a person that feels it is right and proper for the government to make rules over other people's bodies. most especially woman's bodies. such a person is most likely in favor of putting women and doctors in jail for abortions, while at the same time cares nothing for  education (the thing that actually reduces abortion rates). such a person might want to enact laws that favor women going back to the kitchen, becoming housewives again, and so on and so on.
it's a slippery , and it's never long from one step to the next. this is why you always push beyond what is strictly necessary, if something is allowed to stand against principle, no matter how small, it gives the other side a place to stand and start pushing back. and we don't want to meet them in the middle.","my heart is with the single mother who is struggling with poverty and child care, and the teen who cannot escape generational poverty, and the woman who faces violence by her partner. i can relate to such causes.

that might be the problem then.
for the most part, in a large portion of western countries, the major battles have been won if you look at things objectively.
-women outperform men in school.
-women under the age of 30 are typically paid more then men, showing that any earning gap that did exist is quickly closing.
-men are more likely to be victims of violent crime.
-men are equally as likely to be victims of domestic abuse.
-men are equally likely to be .
-women are likely to be issued reduced sentences compared to a man in the event they commit a crime.
-women are overwhelmingly favoured by the courts in custody battles.
-men are more likely to commit suicide.
-men are more likely to be homeless.
-women have far greater access to resources if they are homeless, victims of violence, etc.
-men are 90%+ of workplace fatalities/injuries.
so, when both sexes face fairly equal amounts of hardship, the feminist movement (in the west) has had to move on and focus on things that can arguably be considered ""grasping"" for a problem.
now, that being said, women in the west do still face hardships that men don't (abortion and birth control access being the main one). however, it can easily be argued that men face plenty of hardships that women don't (see my list above).
this is probably why fewer and fewer ""centrist"" people consider themselves feminists anymore in the west and are beginning to embrace the egalitarian and humanist movements/identities.","there seems to be a major misinterpretation of my comment/post, although i'm sorry if i did not elaborate further.
there are two major points to clarify:
firstly, i did not write the original post to say ""please, west, *interfere* in our causes"". i never implied or mentioned that anywhere. where did you get that from? i wrote this in a genuine effort for dialogue and promoting understanding about your perspective because of the disconnect between the south/north. i'm genuinely trying to understand how these causes are considered revolutionary, because they seem to have strong media presence. infact, when i said:
>it is just extremely difficult to comprehend how these issues are considered revolutionary when there are much more deeply rooted problems, particularly economic and political, that should be at the forefront?
i was trying to understand why and how these causes are powerful when compared to challenges such as female poverty, equal opportunity, domestic violence, , lack of political power and so on. from my understanding, despite the progress on these issues, they are still widespread and deeply-rooted in many western countries. the fight for these is what symbolizes the fight for women, in my opinion.
secondly, when i say foreign intervention, i mean when it is foreign governments and men trying to impose their own agenda on us, in the guise of ""advancing women's rights"". that has been our experience - it has not been good. i cherish and appreciate solidarity and compassion from fellow women across the globe, but foreign intervention/influence has been intertwined and tainted with political agendas.","> though, i do not support outsider influence.
ok, so you don't want outsiders being involved in your problems but you don't like when they become involved in their own? that seems.... contradictory.
now don't get me wrong, i personally think things like manspreading are ridiculous and are more someone looking for a problem as opposed to actually having one. however, its pretty strange to complain about the causes ""western"" woman champion meanwhile also saying you don't want them involved/influencing your causes.","thanks for your answer. though, i do not support outsider influence. change should be organic and internal, from within, not imposed or pushed by foreign sides.","it's not that we're unsympathetic; it's more that the west seems remarkably unable to influence the middle east in any way, not just women's issues."
"do you understand what ""outsider influence"" looks like? or are you counting the like of your opinions posted on a public message as some sort of outsider influence that is the key to revolutionizing countries steeped in thousands of years of tradition? you're completely offended that she doesn't think the same way as you. she never said that western problems are objectively insignificant. she said that, to herself, they seem that way, and then literally opened up asking people why it was important to them in an effort to understand. again, shame on her for thinking differently than you. i'm sure shutting her off and telling her that she's just complaining is going to convince her that your causes truly are significant enough to promote intellectual thought and discussions.","where the  did you get that from? i said nothing of barging or straightening anything. the only thing i took offense to was her saying that western problems are so insignificant as to not even be real issues. i didn't demean hers at all. you're way of course, and you claim i'm not following the conversation?","again, knee  response and ignorance about the real world. do you know anything of the history of western influence in the middle east, or do you honestly think that barging in and ""setting things straight"" is a viable solution?","her words ""i do not support outsider influence"" only take a second to understand.......",did you even read the comment where she said she doesn't want outside influence?,"no, she asked a question and got some legitimate answers, as well as a lot of petty responses by people who can't believe that their worldview isn't shared by perfectly reasonable people who would rather question and try to understand instead of shutting down any opposition as ""complaining."" your string of responses is definitely the latter.","yeah, but she's saying ""look at my problems! yours are petty. but i don't want your help, just shut up.""","it's not even that. they literally have no empathy beyond a fb like or some insignificant token. the lives of others around the world don't have a direct impact on their lives, so i doesn't matter to them really. they don't see the maimed bombing victims walking around, or the acid burned face or anything else, so it has no further impact than the tv/computer/phone screen. it's just not a part of their reality"
probably because you were shocked at being suddenly confronted with someone who literally admitted to being an honest-to- . i feel like a lot of people would freeze up too.,had a man at work say he loved loli's after two little girls (9)came through check-out(in dresses with bows in hair). i still to this day feel sick inside and don't know why i said nothing.,anime/manga has terribly misogynistic tropes. and it is especially bad that many young boys and men get acquainted with it and translate it to a fantasy version of girls and women.,"yup. and catering to their ""best waifu"" fantasies. i may get some flack for saying this, but honestly, some anime is to blame for the waifu stereotype.","i've made the mistake of searching why this weird fetish exist. it's all racist stereotypes around us being ""submissive"" .","my ex was like that, he was always obsessed and bragging about the fact he had an asian girlfriend. i left ofc.","add the weird fetishization to that pile. it's all so gross, really makes me wanna just lock myself inside","yup, it is horrendous. sexism and racism with the subtle dismissal of bigotry against asian americans combined with an insane amount of xenophobia against anything that *seems* chinese (because of both covid and anti-ccp) has made it a miserable time."
"what the  i had no idea about any of this, i feel like i just read an episode of black mirror.  this is a weird century.","there is a phenomenon that has been developing recently called being a vtuber. this is when a streamer on the internet uses an animated avatar that follows their movement and  expressions in real time. it allows streamers to perform without worrying about their personal attractiveness and keep other aspects of their personal life private. it also facilitates roleplaying as a character, which is a good fallback for making mild jokes and memes, and creates some interesting variety in streaming content. finally, it subconsciously encourages viewers to participate more directly with the community and the character - for example, drawing a short comic about an imagined situation involving 2 real-life webcam streamers would be really creepy, but drawing the same kind of comic with two vtubers as characters seems relatively normal, since you're only ""taking control"" of them as characters rather than as real people. because of this, vtuber communities tend to encourage a *lot* of interaction from their viewerships - for example, many of the bigger vtubers have enough fanart made of them that they can use freely-given, high quality art of their characters made by people in their communities for their youtube stream thumbnails every day.
there are many, *many* vtubers nowadays: the cost of getting a decent custom live2d avatar made for yourself has gone down in recent years, to the point that it's now in the same ballpark as a good streaming pc or other equipment, and the experience of being a vtuber is pretty much categorically better than being a real-life streamer in pretty much every regard. the audiences are much more positive and supportive, it's easier to be engaging as a performer when you can integrate little bits of character roleplay, and there's less pressure and entanglement with your real life. becoming a vtuber in 2021 is an aspiration similar to ""becoming a streamer"" in 2015. however, since it's a very competitive market, many vtubers find it difficult to achieve the level of success that they're looking for on their own, so most of them opt to join a *management agency*, who handles a wide range of behind-the-scenes stuff for them and allows them to simply focus on streaming and making content (for a cut of their profits).
hololive is the biggest agency known to western viewers, and the second biggest in japan (where all this originated). their viewership really exploded in 2020. they now have several individual streamers with over 1 million subscribers each, and the more popular ones regularly exceed 20,000-30,000 concurrent viewers during normal gaming streams. special events and debut streams can sometimes exceed 100,000 concurrent viewers. they achieved popularity through a few key factors:
1. although their streamers all have various individual character roleplays, as a company they all have a focus on *being an idol*. this is the japanese sense of the word ""idol"", which has some nuances to it that don't translate perfectly to an american audience, but if you think roughly britney spears but a bit more modest and with more of a focus on being friendly and ""pure"", you kind of get the idea. anyway, this focus on being idols gives the entire company a strong sense of drive and the impression of being ambitious underdogs, which makes people want to support them, watch them grow, and celebrate every new opportunity they achieve.
2. all of the streamers are on very good terms with each other, and ""collab"" (do streams with each other) very often. this is very effective cross-advertisement, which encourages their individual viewers to become fans of the entire company, and it also gives their streams a great sense of friendliness and variety. this may be especially appealing to viewers who are lonely and/or socially awkward, since it feels like getting to participate in a conversation between friends. some of the streamers like each other enough to wholeheartedly roleplay as being ""interested"" in each other, and a few have voluntarily become roommates in real life.
3. they happened to hire 2 streamers with particularly strong english skills, who helped build a bridge to english viewers, and eventually laid the groundwork for the company being able to launch a full english branch, which has been incredibly successful.
4. their communities are self-perpetuating because of the effort and involvement of viewers. as i explained before, the nature of these streamers really encourages viewers to invest their own creative skills into the community; the more this happens, and those high-quality creative works are recognized and signal boosted by the streamer, the more exciting and entertaining it becomes to be a viewer of that community, which in turn draws in more viewers, many of which are talented creators as well, and the cycle continues.
5. hololive in particular seems to have a knack for hiring very kind, genuine people. if you look up and down the hololive roster, you won't find a single person who's causing drama, being snarky or passive aggressive, acting jealously, etc. they try to create a supportive, harmonious environment for each other, and serve as role models for their viewers. this is a really attractive form of escapism for people fed up with the cynical, cut-throat society they experience in real life.
now, the bad side: because it's founded on japanese ""idol"" culture, hololive is pervaded with the inherent misogyny of that system. all of the main hololive streamers are women (there's a separate branch for men that is roughly 1/10 as popular), and their entire business model relies on the type of parasocial relationship that an attractive, charismatic woman can form with a horde of lonely male fans. a great deal of hololive's income comes from superchats - stream donations through youtube - that are given by lonely audience members who just want a bit of attention, or want to feel a bit appreciated by the streamer because of their money. of the top 12 highest superchatted youtube channels in the world, 11 are hololive streamers, and two of them have earned over $2 million in total donations, in less than 2 years.
and because of this, to play to their audiences, many of the streamers often rely on jokes and fanservice that you'd think of as intolerably exploitative if it was dialogue written by someone else rather than improv by the streamers themselves - lots of teasing about the size of , questions about the color of  they're wearing, that kind of thing. and to wrap all that up in a bow, a large confluence of factors - from the friendly, non-critical, non-confrontational vibe that the streamers try to effect in their streams, to the unrelenting competition of viewership and donation numbers, to the company's underlying ownership and control of the streamers' *very identities* - means that it's very likely that any points of discomfort or disagreement between the performers, their management, and the demands/expectations of their viewers will just be swept under the rug and never addressed publicly.
there have been some scandals too. one talent was stalked and sexually harassed by her manager - the company eventually took her side and helped her with legal fees and relocation, but only after it appeared like they were trying to bury the issue for a while. another talent was the victim of a horrible, targeted harassment campaign by japanese fans right after she debuted, because she was seen as a ""troublemaker"" or not ""pure"" enough to be an idol, to the point where she resigned in disgrace. what's more, although that person's life was nearly destroyed in the process, it's *strictly not allowed* for anyone in the hololive community - streamers or viewers - to talk about her or what she's been doing since she left the company (ostensibly, this rule is to protect her privacy, but it also serves to protect the company's interests of severely discouraging anyone from trying to maintain their internet popularity after abandoning their company character).
so, in the end, is it a good or bad thing? is it misogynistic or empowering? is it perpetuating the traditionally very exploitative idol culture in japan, or revolutionizing it? is it providing comfort to lonely people, or validating their problematic fetishization of japanese culture and parasocial female attention?
personally, i think it's positive overall. but i'm also solidly part of the lonely male demographic they're intentionally pandering to, so who knows.
edit: oh also, it doesn't really have anything to do with ""anime"" per se. there just happens to be a very high correlation in their fan bases because vtuber avatars use the same art style, and fans of anime tend to be fans of japanese vtubers for a number of reasons. but they're two different industries, really. like i said before, hololive has much more to do with japanese idol culture rather than japanese animation.","can you explain hololive to me? know literally nothing about it, or the culture surrounding it, except that it is in some way linked to anime.","yeah the dehumanization of women, and the lack of racial diversity is really bad. both big factors of why i stopped watching or talking about it into my 20s.
...and now there's hololive, which good lord might as well be called escapism simulator 2021",anime/manga has terribly misogynistic tropes. and it is especially bad that many young boys and men get acquainted with it and translate it to a fantasy version of girls and women.,"yup. and catering to their ""best waifu"" fantasies. i may get some flack for saying this, but honestly, some anime is to blame for the waifu stereotype.","i've made the mistake of searching why this weird fetish exist. it's all racist stereotypes around us being ""submissive"" .","my ex was like that, he was always obsessed and bragging about the fact he had an asian girlfriend. i left ofc."

now, the bad side: because it's founded on japanese ""idol"" culture, hololive is pervaded with the inherent misogyny of that system. all of the main hololive streamers are women (there's a separate branch for men that is roughly 1/10 as popular), and their entire business model relies on the type of parasocial relationship that an attractive, charismatic woman can form with a horde of lonely male fans. a great deal of hololive's income comes from superchats - stream donations through youtube - that are given by lonely audience members who just want a bit of attention, or want to feel a bit appreciated by the streamer because of their money. of the top 12 highest superchatted youtube channels in the world, 11 are hololive streamers, and two of them have earned over $2 million in total donations, in less than 2 years.
and because of this, to play to their audiences, many of the streamers often rely on jokes and fanservice that you'd think of as intolerably exploitative if it was dialogue written by someone else rather than improv by the streamers themselves - lots of teasing about the size of , questions about the color of  they're wearing, that kind of thing. and to wrap all that up in a bow, a large confluence of factors - from the friendly, non-critical, non-confrontational vibe that the streamers try to effect in their streams, to the unrelenting competition of viewership and donation numbers, to the company's underlying ownership and control of the streamers' *very identities* - means that it's very likely that any points of discomfort or disagreement between the performers, their management, and the demands/expectations of their viewers will just be swept under the rug and never addressed publicly.
there have been some scandals too. one talent was stalked and sexually harassed by her manager - the company eventually took her side and helped her with legal fees and relocation, but only after it appeared like they were trying to bury the issue for a while. another talent was the victim of a horrible, targeted harassment campaign by japanese fans right after she debuted, because she was seen as a ""troublemaker"" or not ""pure"" enough to be an idol, to the point where she resigned in disgrace. what's more, although that person's life was nearly destroyed in the process, it's *strictly not allowed* for anyone in the hololive community - streamers or viewers - to talk about her or what she's been doing since she left the company (ostensibly, this rule is to protect her privacy, but it also serves to protect the company's interests of severely discouraging anyone from trying to maintain their internet popularity after abandoning their company character).
so, in the end, is it a good or bad thing? is it misogynistic or empowering? is it perpetuating the traditionally very exploitative idol culture in japan, or revolutionizing it? is it providing comfort to lonely people, or validating their problematic fetishization of japanese culture and parasocial female attention?
personally, i think it's positive overall. but i'm also solidly part of the lonely male demographic they're intentionally pandering to, so who knows.
edit: oh also, it doesn't really have anything to do with ""anime"" per se. there just happens to be a very high correlation in their fan bases because vtuber avatars use the same art style, and fans of anime tend to be fans of japanese vtubers for a number of reasons. but they're two different industries, really. like i said before, hololive has much more to do with japanese idol culture rather than japanese animation.","can you explain hololive to me? know literally nothing about it, or the culture surrounding it, except that it is in some way linked to anime.","yeah the dehumanization of women, and the lack of racial diversity is really bad. both big factors of why i stopped watching or talking about it into my 20s.

wow. that was very insightful. thanks.,"there is a phenomenon that has been developing recently called being a vtuber. this is when a streamer on the internet uses an animated avatar that follows their movement and  expressions in real time. it allows streamers to perform without worrying about their personal attractiveness and keep other aspects of their personal life private. it also facilitates roleplaying as a character, which is a good fallback for making mild jokes and memes, and creates some interesting variety in streaming content. finally, it subconsciously encourages viewers to participate more directly with the community and the character - for example, drawing a short comic about an imagined situation involving 2 real-life webcam streamers would be really creepy, but drawing the same kind of comic with two vtubers as characters seems relatively normal, since you're only ""taking control"" of them as characters rather than as real people. because of this, vtuber communities tend to encourage a *lot* of interaction from their viewerships - for example, many of the bigger vtubers have enough fanart made of them that they can use freely-given, high quality art of their characters made by people in their communities for their youtube stream thumbnails every day.
there are many, *many* vtubers nowadays: the cost of getting a decent custom live2d avatar made for yourself has gone down in recent years, to the point that it's now in the same ballpark as a good streaming pc or other equipment, and the experience of being a vtuber is pretty much categorically better than being a real-life streamer in pretty much every regard. the audiences are much more positive and supportive, it's easier to be engaging as a performer when you can integrate little bits of character roleplay, and there's less pressure and entanglement with your real life. becoming a vtuber in 2021 is an aspiration similar to ""becoming a streamer"" in 2015. however, since it's a very competitive market, many vtubers find it difficult to achieve the level of success that they're looking for on their own, so most of them opt to join a *management agency*, who handles a wide range of behind-the-scenes stuff for them and allows them to simply focus on streaming and making content (for a cut of their profits).
hololive is the biggest agency known to western viewers, and the second biggest in japan (where all this originated). their viewership really exploded in 2020. they now have several individual streamers with over 1 million subscribers each, and the more popular ones regularly exceed 20,000-30,000 concurrent viewers during normal gaming streams. special events and debut streams can sometimes exceed 100,000 concurrent viewers. they achieved popularity through a few key factors:
1. although their streamers all have various individual character roleplays, as a company they all have a focus on *being an idol*. this is the japanese sense of the word ""idol"", which has some nuances to it that don't translate perfectly to an american audience, but if you think roughly britney spears but a bit more modest and with more of a focus on being friendly and ""pure"", you kind of get the idea. anyway, this focus on being idols gives the entire company a strong sense of drive and the impression of being ambitious underdogs, which makes people want to support them, watch them grow, and celebrate every new opportunity they achieve.
2. all of the streamers are on very good terms with each other, and ""collab"" (do streams with each other) very often. this is very effective cross-advertisement, which encourages their individual viewers to become fans of the entire company, and it also gives their streams a great sense of friendliness and variety. this may be especially appealing to viewers who are lonely and/or socially awkward, since it feels like getting to participate in a conversation between friends. some of the streamers like each other enough to wholeheartedly roleplay as being ""interested"" in each other, and a few have voluntarily become roommates in real life.
3. they happened to hire 2 streamers with particularly strong english skills, who helped build a bridge to english viewers, and eventually laid the groundwork for the company being able to launch a full english branch, which has been incredibly successful.
4. their communities are self-perpetuating because of the effort and involvement of viewers. as i explained before, the nature of these streamers really encourages viewers to invest their own creative skills into the community; the more this happens, and those high-quality creative works are recognized and signal boosted by the streamer, the more exciting and entertaining it becomes to be a viewer of that community, which in turn draws in more viewers, many of which are talented creators as well, and the cycle continues.
5. hololive in particular seems to have a knack for hiring very kind, genuine people. if you look up and down the hololive roster, you won't find a single person who's causing drama, being snarky or passive aggressive, acting jealously, etc. they try to create a supportive, harmonious environment for each other, and serve as role models for their viewers. this is a really attractive form of escapism for people fed up with the cynical, cut-throat society they experience in real life.

so, in the end, is it a good or bad thing? is it misogynistic or empowering? is it perpetuating the traditionally very exploitative idol culture in japan, or revolutionizing it? is it providing comfort to lonely people, or validating their problematic fetishization of japanese culture and parasocial female attention?

"i'm going to paint the slightly darker picture that hololive seems to be the idol industry, but different in that it further seperates the real human being performing the voice from their 'public persona'. idk it just seems icky to me.",it's a streaming community of anime characters. they use software to make themselves appear as an anime avatar that's custom made. they roleplay as a character and play games or other activities on stream. there are like 2 dozen of these streamers in japan and na and they each have their own communities and stories involving each other. there is always a stream to watch or catch up on. i think there's more content being made than hours in a day. there's always new memes being made so people clamor to stay caught up. i can easily see people getting completely lost in it. i don't watch it much myself but i can easily see the appeal.,"can you explain hololive to me? know literally nothing about it, or the culture surrounding it, except that it is in some way linked to anime.","yeah the dehumanization of women, and the lack of racial diversity is really bad. both big factors of why i stopped watching or talking about it into my 20s.

"kyoto animation is a studio that was originally founded by women doing the grunt work of animation, mainly outsourcing for other ""proper"" studios and slowly worked their way into being a proper studio animating their own stuff in-house. close to 80% of the workers are still women, and they have made some of the most well known, memorable works in anime. most of their stuff does a pretty good job of portraying girls and women well. violet evergarden is probably one of their best works.
i think there are a lot of studios out there that avoid some of the more problematic issues. it's just cheaper to crank out trash tier series, and there's a massive oversaturation of series these days in the hopes that one will hit gold.","some is fine imo. anime is just medium like book or movies. the isekai, fanservice harem stuffs are equivalent to  romance lits akin to 50 shades. they're made as fantasy escapism for certain type of demographics but you wouldn't hate all books just because 50 shades sold millions.
the problem with anime is part of their society. japan in general still have problems with sexism and that end up being reflected in their media.
another factor is that usually alot of the time, these type of problematic contents are being created by awkward, lonely nerds who rarely talks to women in the first place. their lack of experience with women end up writing badly written female characters that are more like fantasy objects to be won.","""some"" is very generous.","yup. and catering to their ""best waifu"" fantasies. i may get some flack for saying this, but honestly, some anime is to blame for the waifu stereotype.","i've made the mistake of searching why this weird fetish exist. it's all racist stereotypes around us being ""submissive"" .","my ex was like that, he was always obsessed and bragging about the fact he had an asian girlfriend. i left ofc.","add the weird fetishization to that pile. it's all so gross, really makes me wanna just lock myself inside","yup, it is horrendous. sexism and racism with the subtle dismissal of bigotry against asian americans combined with an insane amount of xenophobia against anything that *seems* chinese (because of both covid and anti-ccp) has made it a miserable time."

of all the isekais i've watched or read, grimgar: ashes and illusions sits at the top of my list. even then, there are fanservicey angles and scenes, but no harem or romantic subplots as i remember, for now anyway.

mushoku tensei is  lol i can't really say it's teaching any message when the author reward the actual  groomer protagonist with multiple wives who he groomed in the end. i recall reading somewhere the author just keep making the protag absolute trash of a human to see how far he can go. but it's get alot of backlash within anime fandom and definitely not popular with general public,"agree, mostly, there are some good isekai however.
ascendence of the bookworm is one (female mc obsessed with books), tanya of the evil (male > female mc), next life as a villainess (female mc).
apart from re zero, and mushoku tensei, isekai's are a dime a dozen, and really are not particularly popular. and the two aforementioned tend to be considered widely not mainstream (violence / degeneracy). arguably both of those non-mainstream series at least try to teach an important message (anti-social hikki otaku-extreme culture bad).","exactly this. isekai is the biggest contributor to these type of problematic contents these days. it's literally written as self insert escapism with the protagonist 99% of the time is some otaku loser who manage to restart his life in another world but now surrounded by hot women who fall for him left and right. but isekai is mostly popular with otaku demographic because these contents literally feed otaku's fantasy. i can't think of any isekai series that have the same massive public popularity, maybe sao, compare to darlings like demon slayer and jujutsu kaisen that are massive success rn. the female characters in those series are written strong even though the focus are still mostly on male characters. the shows with more problematic contents are usually consider ""degenerate"" by average japanese too.","just going to point out that the  stereotypes you are referring to consistently rank poorly, and are essentially quick cash grabs on a shoestring budget.

"i mean, re:zero? mushoku tensei? both airing right now, both legitimately popular and not too shabby when it comes to writing quality","exactly this. isekai is the biggest contributor to these type of problematic contents these days. it's literally written as self insert escapism with the protagonist 99% of the time is some otaku loser who manage to restart his life in another world but now surrounded by hot women who fall for him left and right. but isekai is mostly popular with otaku demographic because these contents literally feed otaku's fantasy. i can't think of any isekai series that have the same massive public popularity, maybe sao, compare to darlings like demon slayer and jujutsu kaisen that are massive success rn. the female characters in those series are written strong even though the focus are still mostly on male characters. the shows with more problematic contents are usually consider ""degenerate"" by average japanese too.","just going to point out that the  stereotypes you are referring to consistently rank poorly, and are essentially quick cash grabs on a shoestring budget.

it's a bit at odds with modern japan, with its in-line (1st world) birth rates, working male and female culture, older generations rooted in patriarchial views, with a modern progressive younger generation.
alot of japanophiles (weeaboos), seek out japan like some promised land, where there whiteness is viewed as above the feminine asian males (another harmful, and untrue negative stereotype). it is a cold hard reality when the   man can't get anything more than he would in his home country.","the real problem is that a lot of guys seek out really awful stuff and then they're like ""but it's their culture"" like the fact that it's from japan is a get out of misogyny free card.","just going to point out that the  stereotypes you are referring to consistently rank poorly, and are essentially quick cash grabs on a shoestring budget.

"just pointing out a response to the birth control failure argument for abortion. i went to a texan high school that heavily emphasized abstinence-only  ed and there was definitely implied -shaming.
my school also had an on-site daycare for the students, so.
(fwiw i am vehemently pro choice and very wary of leaving expensive as  ny for cheaper col red states at the potential expense of my bodily autonomy.)",i'm kinda new to this sub so i'm not really sure how to take this.... lol,> then you shouldn't have had  in the first place (you ),"i edited my comment to reflect what i meant, so to take out the obliterate comment.
you are correct about the cheap, easy and effective birth control. however, i challenge you to find one that is 100% effective (except for getting a hysterectomy).  happens, birth control fails, condoms fail.","how do you obliterate this argument? there are many cheap, easy and effective forms of birth control available and not getting pregnant is very easy to do. you literally have to do nothing.","oh this is where that fun argument of ""well maybe she should have realized that having  has consequences and if she wasn't ready for a child she shouldn't be having sex"". that's my favorite one to talk when debating this with certain people. (i rarely all out fight people about this, i hate conflict)
edit: i guess i shouldn't have said obliterate, to be honest. because i can think my points are valid all i want, but usually when i'm debating with someone on abortion, they are so dead set in their ways there is no reasoning with them.","in short, should the rights of a non-viable fetus hold more weight than that of the mother who would be forced ~~to carry it to viability~~ raise the child until approximately age 20 when they don't have the necessary resources (money)?","the issue is whose rights supersede the others - the woman or the fetus? it then delves into a philosophical and scientific question about whether a fetus is considered ""human"" or not. roe v wade determined, based on science, that it is not until it reaches the stage of viability. medical advancements have started to shift the goalposts on viability, though it's still in contention (ie more states are able to pass restrictions after 20 weeks - though the survival rate of a fetus is extremely low, not to mention many tests that determine abnormalities or severe defects aren't able to be performed until that time which is why you see a push to protect the rights and leave the decision up to the mother and doctor).
in short, should the rights of a non-viable fetus hold more weight than that of the mother who would be forced to carry it to viability?"
"don't feel bad at all. you are not an idiot. i didn't feel comfortable talking about it at first but recently i am trying to be open about it online.
i am figuring it out and i will be okay. there's a light at the end. best case, i'll be out by christmas. worst case, i'll be stuck here until summer. i will get out though and so that little bit of hope is keeping me sane. i do feel stuck and defeated but i also am really really hoping to make it out safe one day soon.
there are lots of normal shelters and it's my fault i won't go because of my dogs.
i have called some of the shelters near me. there isn't a way out for me until i get a bundle of cash together but i am working  it and i don't even feel traumatized by it anymore. just exhausted.
please don't feel bad. i was just hoping sharing would help someone else not get here. be safe out there, please. *sends hugs.*
thank you for your compassion though. it is very very much appreciated. more than you know. i can't talk about this to people in real life, so it means a lot to feel *seen* sometimes. thank you for that. seriously wish you the best.","i'm so sorry for what you are going through. i didn't mean to make you relive it with my question and now i feel like an idiot for having asked.
listening to your story...are there any services that assist women in domestic abuse/violence situations? i know you couldn't just go somewhere else, not with two dogs probably, but anyone with whom you could connect to help you to plan your escape? it just sounds like you are incredibly alone and there should be someone nearby (obviously not another man) who could check in with you, help you with sorting out the next steps...
i don't know if you have posted about this before, but there are women smarter and more informed than i who could also give you advice. i can feel how stuck, sad, and defeated you feel. i also hear a spark in your voice that is still fighting!
i wish there were some way for him to go to jail for awhile. just to give you enough time to get away.
i'm so incredibly sorry. you didn't deserve this. none of the victims of abuse do. you were honest and vulnerable because you wanted to believe in the good in people. i don't know why some people have a radar for good people, vulnerable people, or people who haven't figured out how to set boundaries-- and exploit them. i don't know how anyone could be so calculating. it's sick.","tl;dr: i think it was the way that he was always the injured party. like now i know he was the perpetrator of abuse for his relationships and also the other woman he had as a roommate. beware of dudes who seem too kind right off the bat. too helpful. sounds crazy, i know.
when i met him, i had just been assaulted. i talked to him about how i didn't have any family and how i was scared living in my apartment where the guy had stalked me. he knew i was isolated and that i didn't feel comfortable or okay after having to report my harassment, stalking, and assault. i was honest because i am an honest person and i wish i hadn't told him how alone and vulnerable i was.
he offered to help. he pretended to be kind. now, i don't trust myself or my judgement of people. i am not me anymore. i feel so so broken.
at one point, i realized how bad it was when i had to call the cops again a second time. i tried to leave and he tried to hurt me. i thought i could help him somehow. i can't.
if all his stories center around him being the one hurt by others and he seems really kind for no reason... it's probably too good to be true. real men admit their mistakes, flaws, and areas of growth.
oh wait. he also called himself ""an ."" i didn't see it and i feel so so so  for thinking, ""how can you be an  when you're helping me find a new place to live to escape a bad situation?"" jokes on me. he was/is an  and he knew i didn't have anyone to protect me.
he also asked me how much i made indirectly. found out how much at work and somehow all my bills at his place totaled that amount. i have no money leftover to leave. he even borrowed money from me just to keep me here i'm pretty sure.
it started with negging. out of nowhere, a subtle put down. i told him to stop. he did. picked up raising his voice around me... to yelling at me. turned into looming over me without touching me. flipping tables, throwing stuff, slamming stuff. ""accidentally"" knocking me over. being angry at me for existing, somehow. he didn't want to be that way. could i help him? would i go with him to therapy to explain what i saw? could i stay because he got fired from work to help with bills? could i pay for... x, y, z and he'd ""pay me back"" later? packing to leave, he lost it.  lost it. shook me like a rag doll and then later body slammed me to the ground.
some dude i thought would be safe to live with because he was so big and could *protect me* unlike living with another woman... became my biggest nightmare. i'm never happy anymore. i hate my life. i wish i had just continued being stalked and assaulted. living with it had systematically changed my whole identity and i hate who i am now. i don't wish this on any other woman. i have it all documented for the police for when i leave.
i'm terrified to leave until i have the money ready to get a place for myself/my dogs and my important stuff hidden away. i can't leave them with him. i never thought i would be in this position. i would have judged me for not leaving. i wouldn't have understood how much physical danger it actually is, not being safe at home. how much danger it is even *thinking* about leaving, much less slowly planning an emergency escape.
i'm not sure there are real warning signs until you start to hear things like ""you're overreacting,"" ""you're crazy,"" or ""it was a joke!"" sometimes someone can seem normal for years and flip. if i could go back, i would have started planning my escape sooner.",that's a really good point like a crab in water. what warning signs would you tell someone to look out for?,"i'm living with someone like this and i couldn't listen to it all either. i wanted to watch it all because i feel like it's important for us to support one another but it was too hard.
i hate that she hasn't been able to leave yet. i kept thinking about the boiling /frog analogy and i know exactly how she got there. no one ever thinks it could happen to them until it does. i just hope, hope, hope she gets the support she needs so she and her animals can leave.
there are so few domestic violence shelters that accept pets. i bet one of the reasons she hasn't left is because he keeps threatening her dogs. i hate abusive people. i wish there was something we could do for her.",ahh!! thanks for letting me know about this form of abuse. i definitely was exhausted just listening.,"i can't recall the specific terms but abusers apparently do this in order to intentionally cause mental exhaustion so that their victim is more malleable
it's hard to defend yourself or feel safe or able to leave when this is constant. and then i'm sure he will love bomb her too afterward so that the drastic shift from awful to perfect disarms her further.
my heart breaks that she has had to deal with even a moment of this guy"," this is waaaayyy too complicated. if someone is playing all of these mind games, it's time to leave.
he was annoying the  out of me with all the yelling, double-talk, circuitous talk, blaming...no one deserves to live like that. i just tuned him out after awhile...i can see why she would too. ""wahwahwahwah"" yeah go  yourself buddy."

tldr; you can enter  work consensually and still be exploited. money is a factor in making decisions, and the pay for  work might be the best choice for an individual, even if they hate it. we need to decrease the stigma surrounding  work so that people aren't trapped by the threat of being exposed. there are definitely hundreds of men out there who did contribute indirectly to my abuse, but i don't blame them. there's one out there who made an ethical, selfless decision, and my gratitude to him has endured for more than a decade. if  work hadn't been an option i would have been homeless at one point. i don't know what the right answer is and i'm sorry this got so long and disjointed. it's incredibly complex.","incidentally this is my problem with the  industry generally. there is no good way to spot who is in it because they ""want to be"" and who is there because of  like this. so basically there is no ethical way to consume someone's body in a capitalist context, and any men who frequent  services enough have probably knowingly or unknowingly contributed to somebody's abuse.","it reminds me of britney, but this almost feels worse because the britney thing was public knowledge. one of the biggest female entertainers on the planet has been abused and essentially prostituted for six years and nobody knew a thing. it's so maddening.",holy  this is horrifying.
"yes definitely. i don't know what the answer is either, but to me the glaring issue is also society's view on women. i don't think making  work legal and regulated is going to change that and instead will only endanger more women since the root issue isn't being addressed by doing that.
i hope we figure something out soon.","i think it all circles back to purity culture and objectifying women. certain jobs may be legal, but they still have a negative reputation and are largely stigmatized by the general population. ""you're a model? that's so cool! oh, you're an onlyfans model? ."" ""you're a dancer? wow, what kind, ballet? stripping?! so you sell your body to strangers."" ""you're an actress in minor films?! that's awesome, what kind of films? oh, ?""
i don't know what the answer is, but as usual, nothing will change until society's view on women does, because a guy who has a lot of  is a player, while a woman is a  or a .","but there is already a lot of  work that isn't illegal (like of, stripping, ) and it's still such a huge problem. i just don't see how further supporting this would change anything.","this! when  work is decriminalized & made less stigmatized, it opens up ways for sws to take legal action against clients who mistreat them. people are financially abused in many different jobs,  work just makes it a different kind of awful.","or, you know, the fact that it's criminalized in any capacity (legalization requires some aspects to be made illegal) makes it impossible to have labour standards set by workers?
decriminalization fights human trafficking.","how many times have we heard that of is more ethical because women can do it all themselves? if there's a way to exploit it, someone will find it - it's really naive to think everyone is doing it through choice.","incidentally this is my problem with the  industry generally. there is no good way to spot who is in it because they ""want to be"" and who is there because of  like this. so basically there is no ethical way to consume someone's body in a capitalist context, and any men who frequent  services enough have probably knowingly or unknowingly contributed to somebody's abuse.","it reminds me of britney, but this almost feels worse because the britney thing was public knowledge. one of the biggest female entertainers on the planet has been abused and essentially prostituted for six years and nobody knew a thing. it's so maddening."
"it's complicated. for instance [this study ]() found that legalizing  work increased human trafficking. the demand for  workers outpaced the ability to supply it through legal means. whether legalization actually decreases human trafficking (a claim made flippantly all the time) is far from a settled matter. it needs more research but what we have currently indicates the opposite.
i did an analysis comparing the impacts of legalization, decriminalization and criminalization of  work. all have their various pros and cons. and as others have already said even among the cohort who ""want to do it"" there's a lot of different reasons. examples: i want to do it because it's the only way i can afford to eat. i want to do it because my boyfriend really wants me too. i want to do it because it's the only way i can get my  at a discount.
like the reasons for ""wanting to"" aren't always free of coercion or positive which is why ""choice feminism"" can be lacking in its refusal to analyze what influences people's choices.","but there is already a lot of  work that isn't illegal (like of, stripping, ) and it's still such a huge problem. i just don't see how further supporting this would change anything.","this! when  work is decriminalized & made less stigmatized, it opens up ways for sws to take legal action against clients who mistreat them. people are financially abused in many different jobs,  work just makes it a different kind of awful.","or, you know, the fact that it's criminalized in any capacity (legalization requires some aspects to be made illegal) makes it impossible to have labour standards set by workers?

"it sounds like she is someone who is aggressive and seeks people who are compliant and willing to validate her on a superficial level. her husband is willing to put up with changing the goal posts and she sought out your husband for the same reasons. she doesn't like strong people and she doesn't like to be called out on her bad behavior (putting it mildly). she is terrible, and toxic, and if you can completely avoid her please do so.
i'm amazed by your strength and resilience. i think one of the toughest parts of going through a hard time like this is that you don't get validation, and support is erratic. people want to help, but it feels awkward and you find yourself trying to put others at ease instead of really getting help. i think you should try to seek out any means of support possible. ask people to help you with your specific needs. please don't be shy of this.","her husband already knows and seems to be as 'okay' with it as he possibly can be. i posted this below but i don't know that it's super visible:

if you can get ahold of ginger people products (sold on amazon and elsewhere), those are also fantastic. they have ginger juice and a bunch of different candies of varying intensity. also excellent for motion sickness, btw.
tomato soup (cheap- campbell's condensed) and iced tea with lemon wedges will also do the trick. that little bit of acidity will often cut the nausea a little.
i also find myself turning lately to pho with lime squeezed in as a good, soothing remedy, for the same reason as the above. get it delivered, or do up a  yourself (i use jet tila's quick recipe and mod it to make it easier, so i don't have to go to the grocery--let me know if you want my mods).
also, if it sounds good, try eating it. your body may decide ""i can make this one thing work,"" so give it a shot. make sure that you're getting *some* calories in (if all you can handle are milkshakes, well, sounds like you're drinking milkshakes) and are staying hydrated.

"as an aside - i went to a year-round school from 1st through 3rd grade and it was pretty dope. summer vacation was 6 weeks, not 10, and those extra weeks were dispersed to other holidays. i think we got 4 weeks for christmas, a week and a half for thanksgiving, and 3 weeks for spring break.

"is that for younger students?
for university, most countries have 15 weeks per semester, my country does 18 weeks. a professor of mine that taught in other countries before said he noticed that the 18 week semester is far too long for students to stay focussed.
he said he felt students in my country started losing focus around the 13/15 week mark, and so he started to structure the course around 15 weeks, so the first week he just did a through summary of the course, and didn't start in the topics until the second. had a week where we could come in to discuss stuff with him but there was no lecture, and we took exams a week early and the last week was a presentation.
he said he found that had a much better results than the 18 week one.","the long gap for summer break means that kids lose some of what they learned the year prior, since it isn't actively being reinforced. in turn, in order to get kids back into the next school year's curriculum, teachers have to take time at the beginning of the first semester to bring kids back up to speed. districts and systems that have switched to year-round policies have shown better results from students in retention and performance as a result of the switch.","curious, what is the argument for year-round school? i have no dog in this fight so i'm just wondering.",alternatively: the us is too traditionalist to change from its puritain-agrarian roots. we'll see provisional ballots just after we switch to a year-round school schedule and hold violence in media as more damaging to kids than .,because the government doesn't actually care about the will of the people.,it's so freaking weird that elections are (still) on tuesdays in the us. of course the turnout is going to be low... why not vote on sundays like most countries?,"20 minute line is enough to dissuade at least 40% of eligible voters from doing so in presidential elections. factor in having to wake up an hour early and it goes up to \~60% for midterm elections.

i can't replace my husband's $28 an hour job cashiering at walmart. so, yeah, this is going to have serious ramifications.
we'll get a definitive diagnosis at the advanced neurology center early this week.","what you're describing sounds very serious, and you might need to start calling in some help from friends and family. you mention in a response here that family lives far away, but this sounds like something that you may be unable to deal with on your own and you will need resources to help your husband, care for your new child, and come up with a long term plan for how to manage this. sometimes you have choices to involve family members, and you'd rather not if they are far away, and sometimes you don't because the issue is serious enough that they need to be there. this may be one of those times.
it sounds like your husband's physicians have an idea what's going on, but maybe haven't made a final determination or disclosed their suspicions to you while they wait on testing. it might be beneficial for you to sit down with a neurologist one-on-one and make them explicitly spell out exactly what they think is going on with your husband, as well as the long-term ramifications and progression of his diagnosis. make sure to ask them what the ramifications of a diagnosis might be on your husband's work and life long term. this sounds very serious, and you are going to need all of the information available to make good choices.
some of the responders here are attributing the problems you describe to ""lack of sleep"" or other more minor and temporary issues. however, the symptoms and history you describe also bring up the possibility that this may be a more serious chronic health diagnosis.
no one here can help you troubleshoot what is going on, as this will be something that needs to be done by your husband's specialist physician--likely the neurologist. this is far above reddit's paygrade.
i'm being repetitive, but i can't stress the importance right now of cornering your husband's medical team if you need to and making them tell you what's going on. bring a trusted friend or family member with you, record or take notes, and make them repeat things that don't make sense. if this turns out to be minor, great, but if it's not, you will want to know now so that you can plan instead of being blindsighted in the future.

about 6 years ago i moved to a northern city. the population of this ""city"" is a fraction of halifax, but because there are so many well paying jobs up here, it really draws people up. i haven't had any problem finding a doctor. sure, there are fewer people here in general. but i would argue there's a greater concentration of doctors here. especially young doctors recently out of school looking to pay off student loans. there's also a much shorter wait time of you go to the er despite there only being one hospital.
i don't think universal healthcare is the problem in atlantic canada... i think it's a combo of the aging population/ high student loans for young professionals/ lack of well paying jobs to pay off those student loans.","i'm in an urban area. halifax, the largest urban area in my region actually. so that's not an excuse either.",universal healthcare doesn't cause this problem. distribution of resources and where healthcare providers want to actually live does. i'm from a rural area originally. general practitioners are scarce there. i've seen both canadian and american systems from a provider perspective. everyone waits in non-urban areas.,"more than likely they aren't american and live in a country where there is universal healthcare, where such waiting lists do exist and sometimes have very long waiting periods.
edit: grammar","no disrespect *mattadd*, i respect your opinion & experiences, but find it hard to believe that you couldn't find a doctor for 2 years.

"another poster put it well, for atlantic canada you're going to have a difficult time finding young doctors wanting to move to the provinces unless they're from there.
halifax may be the largest urban area out there but it doesn't have the same draw as other urban areas to bring in new people. it's unfortunate.","i'm in an urban area. halifax, the largest urban area in my region actually. so that's not an excuse either.",universal healthcare doesn't cause this problem. distribution of resources and where healthcare providers want to actually live does. i'm from a rural area originally. general practitioners are scarce there. i've seen both canadian and american systems from a provider perspective. everyone waits in non-urban areas.,"more than likely they aren't american and live in a country where there is universal healthcare, where such waiting lists do exist and sometimes have very long waiting periods.

"oh ffs your misrepresenting the situation to the point you might as well be lying then.
halifax and the atlantic provinces in general has both an aging population and young professionals not staying. this means that the number of new gps in the province has not being going up, while the number of people who need access to gps to manage chronic conditions has been going up. as well as current gps retire, their patients need to find other primary care physicians.
what this means is that the waiting list is not agnostic. people with chronic conditions who really need access to a primary care physician are getting placed on the list before you.
that's got  all to do with universal healthcare and more to do with the fact less people want to work and live in atlantic canada in combination with the aging population out there.","i'm in an urban area. halifax, the largest urban area in my region actually. so that's not an excuse either.",universal healthcare doesn't cause this problem. distribution of resources and where healthcare providers want to actually live does. i'm from a rural area originally. general practitioners are scarce there. i've seen both canadian and american systems from a provider perspective. everyone waits in non-urban areas.,"more than likely they aren't american and live in a country where there is universal healthcare, where such waiting lists do exist and sometimes have very long waiting periods.

while laziness is definitely a factor (particularly when it comes to women) let's also not forget the horrific staffing and overwork issues in and around healthcare in general. combine that with the unending nightmare which is health insurance (or it's lack) and frankly it's a miracle that we have so few failures of care as it is. our health system is a bloody nightmare.,"ugh thank . i agree, and it makes me sick to think of how many people die or are seriously disabled because of lazy doctors/ medical staff.","exactly! that was her 3rd time in the e.r as well. she didn't have insurance so getting into a specialist was a whole other challenge but i think after like the 6th e.r visit she finally got a recommendation. unfortunately they also misdiagnosed and it took another few months to final figure it was cancer.
thankfully she's doing better now, after colon removal and a colostomy bag . it just makes me rage how complicated and sadistic this healthcare system is. i wonder if she could have had a easier time if they took her seriously earlier. i mean even after she was at the specialist she was downplayed and it took months for them to figure it was cancer.",when doctors tell you to be honest about drug use but then blame everything on it. smh. that's so sad. is she ok now? or was it too late?,"this is infuriating and i feel for op. my friend went to the er multiple times because she couldn't stop puking. she weighed 80lbs. the doctors told her

i agree and i think coming to terms with certain types of past actions are harder than others. we all want to see ourselves as the protagonists of our stories. it can be a massive identity shift to accept you have caused someone harm on that level in your past.,"i think you're right.
it can be frustrating to make an effort to change and then hear that you're part of the problem after making that effort to change. i don't know if you can ever totally get rid of the bad influences, maybe just learn to recognize it and try to act differently? either way, some people find it hard to come to terms with their past actions.
it can be hard to step back and realize that these conversations are not an attack on men. this subject is mostly talked about in a negative light, which can initially make it feel like it isn't constructive until we realize how important it is for women to be able to share these experiences and for others to read them and see that this is a real problem that exists in our world. women are just sharing what they've experienced and venting their frustrations. men do the same thing!
mostly, i think we all just need to drop our egos, listen, and learn from each other.","i honestly think this is why the very defensive ""not all men"" attitude is so prevalent. i think there are many men who suspect they may have crossed a line in their youth and feel a bit defensive.
idk i just know most times ppl get super defensive is because they recognize something in the critique they don't want to admit is true.","i bet you're right!
most if not all of the men i've known grew up with a culture that centers around objectifying women, myself included. i want to say it starts around puberty, but it's probably younger. we learn to channel our attraction and  urges in ways that are hurtful towards the women we desire and damaging to all of our relationships with women, even if they're platonic friendships.
some boys realize its unhealthy and wrong, usually in their mid-twenties, but some never do. i'm not sure if it's social change or maturity that shifts that mindset. #metoo started when i was around that age.
i could totally see how both dads could think about how they acted when they were younger, because it's so common! i cannot think of a man i've known who hasn't shown some of that behavior or acknowledged that they did in the past.
i'm convinced the only way to stop it is for men to purposely change their culture. how we view and talk about women shapes how the next generation will. we have to learn it from somewhere, because little boys certainly don't objectify women from birth. that behavior is learned. respect can be too. good on them for believing her and trying to teach that boy to be better.","tbh honest, i think my brother believed her bc he was that sort of boy when he was younger.","wow, sadly i am surprised that both dads believed her...","this even happens when they're sober! my little 14 year old niece was fooled by a 17 year old friend of hers (not  like ur poor cousin, but absolutely lied to and used), who acted sad bc the girl he really wanted to sleep with wouldn't have him. my brother found out and went to talk to the kid's dad and the boy gladly threw her under the bus. thankfully both dads knew the kid was a liar and they got the truth out of him. kids can be taught right, and protected by strong parents, and still do these things.",my cousin was  by a guy she was friends with since middle school. before it happened she told me he was devastating a mutual friend wouldn't date him and was dating someone else. that was a red flag for me and i told her to be careful around him. they got  and he  her.

"oh, for sure! education is a stepping stone in that path. i didn't mean for it to sound like i disagreed with adding education, just that i think it wouldn't solve the problem alone.
i would guess that a big part of what has helped me is listening to the conversations surrounding the me too movement. that was part of my on-going education and we never had these conversations in school. maybe if we had a critical thinking class discussing gender issues, i would have realized my mindset was unhealthy sooner? i hope so.","i agree with that. i still think some standard class to make the standards known makes sense. it doesn't solve the issue of course, it's more to fill gaps that fact that common decency doesn't mean universal decency. sometimes we have to come right out and explicitly tell kids what is right and wrong and why sometimes.","it's a cultural thing for men. there's not a class or a thing my parents could have said that would have made me act better when the hormones kicked in. i wanted  all the time and would go to extraordinary lengths or put up with almost anything to get it.
men in my life always objectified women, which led to me doing the same. family, teachers, strangers, other boys my age, media...they all influenced how i viewed and treated women, but it wasn't a conscious decision to do it. that's what was normal.
we would talk about ""that fine piece-of-ass"" and even came up with code phrases we could use to say these things to each other in public and not sound creepy to an outsider. none of us were violent, all of us knew about and respected consent, but we were still acting in damaging ways that were unhealthy.
it's a culture, not just an education thing. we knew it was wrong, so we hid it from women. maybe the education would have worked at a younger age, but once puberty set in, it was there until i made an effort to change myself and grow.
men need to take responsibility for changing how they view and talk about women or this will never change. how we act shapes future generations because kids pick up on it too. women can help by teaching men and influencing media, but at the end of the day, men need to step up and own changing our own culture or this won't stop.","heck make it more general then. it's not  ed it's respecting boundries class.
knowing that you can say no to someone touching you, knowing that's wrong to intimidate others, knowing it's wrong to take advantage of someone when they don't know what it going on.
all of these can be applied to non- instances too, and are also wrong then.","if the school steps in, parents complain. they either pull a religious argument or ""that's the parents' job!"" and it kills the whole discussion.","education on  in the us is a joke, and this is a symptom of that. if parents won't do it the school should step in, except it doesn't really.
imagine if sensitivity training or a class on  harassment was mandatory.",no this point of view is not the problem. you're right that victim blaming is not a good solution but the person was just expressing how helpless they would be to protect their daughter. education of men only works if everyone gets on board and as we know not every parent is going to agree they should educate their sons this way.,"this point of view is the problem. why is it on women to hide and protect themselves, and why as a potential parent do people think this is the answer? why not teach our sons to respect women and their bodies and generally not be assholes? people do have some influence here, and it's not about imprisoning your daughters but about teaching your sons basic decency."
"you hit the nail on the head. this is something every man i've known has gone through and has only escaped by making an effort to change, myself included.","exactly, if it's not your dad it's your coach or one of your friends, or the cool older kid in your class that you look up to, or your brother, or your brother's coach, or one of your brother's friends, the list can go on for a while. unless a guy is smart, defiant, lucky, avoidant, or some combination of those, you get an individual who by some male role model was taught that that empathy makes you weak, what you want is what's most important, and that  defines you. if you're a young man, eventually you're gonna be faced with someone who's going to try his hardest to teach you terribly unhealthy things about yourself, women, relationships, , and whatever else they're going to try and spew at you.

chanel miller has a wonderful ability to express the horrors of her case in a vivid, infuriating, moving way, while managing to throw in just enough humor and tangents to keep the book engaging and readable. whether that humor is for the reader's sake or her own is unclear (perhaps both).
she chooses not to dwell on physical specifics purely to dwell on them; details are revealed sparingly and with purpose. the book is more about her emotional trauma and healing over time, and how the assault and the court case consume her life and the lives of those close to her (until they no longer do). she writes about how she learns to cope with herself and how to share her experience with others. she also writes about how those processes are not and may never be complete.
so, tl;dr i can't promise you that you'll feel safe reading her book. but i do believe she wrote it with other survivors in mind.","he does like to read! i'll recommend it to him. do you think it's a ""safe read"" for me?","if your boyfriend likes to read, i'd recommend know my name by chanel miller.","i was  at 18 by a boy in my dorm. i was suicidal at the time and had enogh to deal with. i had no idea where the nearest  centre was. my boyfriend doesn't understand why i didn't press charges against him, and we always end up arguing if this comes up. he won't try to understand how hard it can be, and it's infuriating. thank you for saying this, i feel like my feelings are finally validated.","*if you feel like you can.

"you are not wrong for believing something you observed was  assault by your definition. witnessing assault is also traumatizing and i'd encourage you to seek out therapy or at least a close friend and talk through those feelings but those feelings, while 100% valid, do not center your friend and her agency which is vital to the recovery process.

seek out your own peace friend and give yourself grace. it sounds to me from your other comment that you witnessed something traumatic and you probably reacted out of that trauma. it was not helpful to your friend, but it was a very understandable and human reaction. seek support and talk through those feelings in your own spaces away from these friends. you deserve peace.",hey. i was in the presence of what i believe to be  assault. the next morning after the girl was told what happened (she was barely conscious) and she laughed it off. am i in the wrong for still believing this was  assault if she says it isn't after the fact?,"even in those situations i'd encourage the use of phrases likes ""that sounds like  to me"" or ""that absolutely fits my definition of assault"" or ""from my perspective, you were the victim here and he is gaslighting you"". i believe that whenever possible it is best to allow those who've experienced trauma room to process and define it for themselves. when you have just had your agency violated those who would seek to help you should center your agency in their response.",yep 100% unless someone is asking for help to figure out what happened to them or what they should do (happens often on this page with dv and sa situations) let them define it,"hey i know your probably saying this is good faith but as a survivor i thought i'd mention it's important for us to get to define our own experiences. she may absolutely consider this , but she might not and we shouldn't take away her agency further by correcting her when she hasn't used that term to define her experiences.",not taking no? you mean .,yea my story is similar. guy couldn't take no for an answer. who was i going to tell? he was the golden boy of the squadron and i was at the bottom....,"i hear you. tried as i could, i couldn't ever be ""equal"" and one of the guys. one of my colleagues wouldn't take no for an answer when we were drinking in my barracks room and he left right after he was done. i ended up being the  for getting  and letting him in my barracks room...we were both e5s."

you are speaking nonsense in terms of evolutionary/behavioral sciences.
these are biological functions, hardwired, that means our software updates (social evolution) can only have so much of an impact.
obviously i'm not advocating for debasing a person by equating them to their  value. i am saying that we are still cavemen when it comes to primitive mating instincts and no one should feel ashamed about sexually fantasizing about other humans.
also, i find it humorous you are implying that we, as a society, have normalized sexualizing ppl as opposed to that being the natural state.
you says it's insane to be sexualized just for existing....but  is what created you
 thoughts are not perverse","we aren't cavemen. reproduction for us now includes mental and emotional aspects as well as physical. the fact that even you consider sexualizing random people says a lot about how normalized it is, when it shouldn't be because, again, we are evolutionary evolved from cavemen who only rely on instinct to survive. i think it's more than reasonable to not wish to be sexualized for just existing.","i get where you are coming from...but it is literally insane to act like having  thoughts about strangers isn't 100% in the norm.

"no interest in a debate here, these topics have been discussed for thousands of years by peeps much smarter than me. however, there is truth in science. verifiable, testable truths. do we have all the answers? of course not. but there can be no truth in religious beliefs; it's just an opinion. was just providing my internet 2 cents to ops point.

i would definitely recommend trusting science when science has an answer; but there are so many more questions to which it doesn't yet, and i understand wanting to fill those gaps, especially with hopeful beliefs.","very well said! believe what is true, not things you wish were true.","it's not about proving that the soul doesn't exist, but explaining what we think of as a soul - the consciousness and the odd things it's been reported to do that we can't yet explain.
there is absolutely no need to prove ""god"" doesn't exist, as there is no concrete, objective evidence that it does. all the ""evidence"" comes from people who will happily see it as a confirmation of their existing bias, or those initially unbiased who, unable to explain a phenomenon, will turn to the closest faith to do so.
believing in something grander than oneself is a profoundly human thing, and i say that with deep respect. spirituality and faith can help a lot of people move forward and grow, and it can create absolutely wonderful communities.

"you know, i think you're the first person that i have seen who honestly and accurately describes both points of view without resorting to defamatory accusations.
it usually descends into arguments / accusations along the line of ""you just want to control women!"" and ""you're a baby murderer!""","if you want to get technical, pro-legal abortion and anti-legal abortion.
and the issue is not one of choice. the issue is that of a conflict of rights and a definition of personhood.
again, you are not pro choice. you are pro the legality of one very specific choice in one very specific context.
which i am too.
anti abortionists are trying to defend what they percieve to be one specific human life in one very specific context through being against the legality of one specific procedure.
it's not ""choice"" you are defending, it's one choice. you don't care and don't defend many other choices.
it's not ""life"" they are defending. it's one specific way of life in one specific context. and they don't give a  about many other lives.
the rest is propaganda. condemning their propaganda while considering yours ""the truth"" is the definition of hypocrisy.","pro-abortion is also a misleading and cringey term, if you ask me. it plays right into what forced-birthers want to believe. that there are people out there who just love abortions and want everybody to get them. the issue truly is one of choice. there are people asking to be allowed to make this decision themselves, and those who oppose giving women the ability to make that decision. it low-key sounds like an anti-choice stance and i'm almost certain that's what you're trying to do with it.","it's anti one choice in particular. the same way pro choice is for one choice in particular. abortion.

both are crappy, both hinder debate, both are cringy.",it really is an anti-choice stance. this debate is way more about controlling women and removing bodily autonomy than it is about abortion itself. i think it's incredibly apt.,i've seen it used. it's as cringy as anti-choice. they are second-generation euphemisms.,"the position of ""anti-life"" sounds like you're trying to genocide the human race","why do people indulge anti-abortionists by calling them ""pro-life"". this is a title made up by them to make themselves sound better. they can call themselves that if they want but i don't see why the rest of us should. they are anti-abortion - pure and simple."
"oh, far from it. often times they claim that the pregnancy should be ""re-implanted"" back into the . there is no proven process to do that.
which means that they don't care about nature. they don't care about gods will. it's all a sham. if  cared about babies the second fertilization happened then he wouldn't let so many of them be naturally miscarried. they know this. they only care about controlling and subjugating women. the anti-choice women out there generally agree with medically necessary abortions, because their intentions are generally more well-intended if not highly privileged and out of touch.",yes! and there is zero chance the men on that committee did not know they were leaving out ectopic pregnancy.,it's simply awful. i had a mmc for an ectopic pregnancy and under this law no one would have saved my life because it would be seen as . horrifying.,"it is. i had what i suspect now were several miscarriages when i was trying to have my first baby. i had a luteal phase defect, and once that was discovered i was able to sustain a pregnancy. i am horrified to think of the implications of this law in a situation like that.","it is, but most people don't even realize they were pregnant for the rest of them, just seems like an oddly timed and heavy period. those people would be safe i think as if they didn't even know they were pregnant no one else is going to. still, it's inhumane and heartbreaking we even have to have this conversation.",i think it is even higher!,"10 - 15% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage apparently... if i lived in georgia, i

"the book has definitely been on my list! i'm currently in the midst of reading the wheel of time series and i want to finish it before i read anything else.
i don't mind that the show is dark. i really love horror as a genre, although i stopped watching the saw series after the second or third one. those are definitely gore and torture .","if you want to give it a try and haven't already, i found the book much more positive than the show and liked it way more. i only watched a few episodes of the show because it felt too much like torture  (misogyny ?) to me, but the book shows a way more nuanced, at times hopeful, portrayal of the main character's inner life. reading the book was invigorating to me, whereas the show felt extremely draining.","honestly i think full gilead is the endgame for these guys. i love the show, but i had to take breaks while watching it because it hit so close to home. i honestly think a lot of religious men want this as a reality.","you are probably very much right. the thing that scares me the most is the idea that they *do* notice the issue and try to *fix* it somehow. because at that point, they'd go full gilead. not allowing women to leave the state, not allowing families to emigrate without some 'proper reason', disincentivising migration to an undue extent ('private individuals can't own property in georgia if they don't live there for at least 6 months a year' or similar rules), or similar.","i don't think they will notice. i was raised mormon and left, and my limited experience with my family is that religious people fall into two categories. those that have faith and can be opened minded, critical and logical without losing that faith, and those that wear rose colored glasses. the people who wear those glasses refuse to absorb any information that contradicts their faith and worldview. they will either deny it exists and refuse to look at it altogether, or come up with a bizarre explanation that makes it wrong. these people are very much the same people who will pound a square peg into a round hole, even if it breaks the peg and the board with the hole in it, and then will look at the broken, useless result and proudly proclaim that it's perfect.
just to be clear, i don't care what people believe as long as they do not try to convert me. since leaving mormonism i really enjoy speaking to other people about their religion and culture.
in short, i do not think these guys are capable of critically analyzing this situation, and if they are, they are manipulating the situation into one that will directly benefit them.","it does really make me wonder, to a certain extent. as a progressive catholic, i have a lot of experience with religious people, including conservative religious nutjobs. from my experience, there usually is an element of wanting to create a 'godly utopia' there- lots of misogyny, lots of delusions, but mixed in with an element of genuine desire to create this environment that matches their misguided, horrible, but still genuinely held religious beliefs. a world full of godly christian couples married to one another in hard-working prosperity, smiling kids running around everywhere. all white or extremely assimilated poc people, of course, and daddy definitely makes a good bit of money.
i do wonder: when they see in a few years that the people coming closest to that weird little image - educated young families- are the ones running for the hills the fastet, will they realise that something has gone wrong in their grand plan? or will they be too delusional to notice?","they're not thinking about it hard enough, or abstractly enough, to understand this. at this point i think they're either delusional or doing this just to keep their conservative voters.","i don't think republicans in many us states appreciate the huge amount of brain drain this will cause. educated, well-off women, both single women and entire families, will migrate to blue states or leave the us entirely. that includes women who very much want kids.
i'm a married, catholic woman with three wanted kids who never dated anyone but her husband. i *personally* would not abort a fetus unless it was medically necessary. i'm basically a republican's wet dream. yet i would *never* have gotten pregnant in a us red state. my family has a history of complicated, dangerous pregnancy issues. my mum had two (!) pregnancies implant in her fallopian tubes *within one year*. i was very aware when i started trying for kids that i might need abortion as healthcare at some point to save my life. i wouldn't have undergone pregnancy in a state where the failsafe of abortion wasn't available in case things go south, ergo, my husband and i would have moved. that would have meant the loss of two fully qualified lawyers for that state.
i'm not sure whether republicans understand that the very people red states need- because many red states are *already* struggling economically- will leave due to fears like the ones you have right now, and the ones i would have had in a similar situation."

it goes both ways. i'm not happy with the lefts' handling of the pandemic when it came to *some* of the mandates. we unrolled electronic vaccine passports where i am (canada, so liberal not left; ideals similar) which made for barriers to access certain things, even care , for people who were not tech savvy. this is particularly true for already marginalized groups -- unhoused, substance abuse disordered, poverty, elderly, etc.. that is just one example, though -- there were plenty that i feel caused a lot of harm and took away privileges that were bordering on taking away items from the hierarchy of basic human needs.
that isn't to say they weren't necessary; it's just that when public understanding and when science changed, we didn't update our approach. we let mothers birth alone. we let people die alone. we isolated our elderly and vulnerable in long term care centers to their rooms for months, not allowing social interaction beyond brief changes. ""rights"" might be subjective, but let's not pretend that the left is pure and innocent.
we are still denying people visitors in the hospitals if they don't have a vaccine passport, despite having ways to mitigate risk in the absence of the electronic passport.

good luck my friend. we're gonna need it.,"it's just that none of that has to happen that way.
for example, as i understand it, there is zero legal problem with stuffing the supreme court. it's been the general understanding that you don't do that, and to some degree for good reasons, but it's not illegal.
now imagine a world where the supreme court tries to enforce theocratic rules on a population that's, i dunno, 70% atheists, 25% super-liberal christians/muslims/whatever, and 5% extremists. do you really think that that society will simply wait for judges now on the sc to die, and to just accept (and implement) all the oppression dictated by them in the meantime? rather than do the obvious and find whatever loophole there is to stop what almost everyone among the population and representatives agrees is abuse? like, say, appointing another 10 sane judges to the supreme court so that the religious nutjobs can be ignored?
that's really my point: if there is a consensus in the population that theocracy is not acceptable, then formal rules won't be able to overrule that. it ultimately doesn't matter that some rule says that people need to be oppressed, when people generally disagree. a few religious nutjobs ultimately can not force a whole nation to obey their rules. you always can start declaring their nutjobbery as terrorism and then remove judges from the bench for being members of a terrorist organisation. or whatever. you generally want to be careful with those kinds of methods, but if there is a vast majority that supports it, that is what's going to happen, no need to burn it all down.","i know i'm part of the problem. but when you truly feel deep down inside that the problems can't be fixed then there's no point in trying. and i do think it's supported by reality. the trunp administration absolutely stacked rhe most important courts with young extremely radical judges with lifetime appointments. congress is useless, it's the courts where the real change is. the supreme court only hears a small handful of cases a year, the vast majority of established law goes through the lower appellate courts, where they are now overly stacked with young extremist activist judges. and there won't be progress there for 70 years until they all die out. by that time i will be dead, and so will many of the users here. yes i know i'm being doom and gloom but it's truly how i feel. the only way to fix things is to burn it all down and start over from scratch. but since that isn't going to happen i've given up. so have many of the people i know","i hope you realize that then you are part of the cause of that happening, right?
but also, i think that view isn't really supported by reality. consider that there is a quite significant imabalance between older and younger people when it comes to conservatism, and in particular when it comes to religion. while that means that it could be a slow-ish process, it seems pretty much inevitable that with old people dying, they won't be able to hold on to power, even with all the tricks that they are using.

it is so ridiculous. i always comment that if they don't trust the medical professionals they themselves were seeking help from that they needed to do everyone a favor and deliver the baby themselves at home. don't put others at risk because of your selfishness.","my mom is an rn at a hospital (postpartum care) and it's infuriating hearing some of the stories of people there. people who don't want to wear masks, people who are irate about the one visitor policy, people who think it's all made up. meanwhile, she's had four positive patients in the last six weeks and it takes her 30 minutes to get in full ppe to tend to the patient and the amount of heartbreak she sees these moms experience because they've never seen or held their newborn because of a positive  difficult for her. it amazes me how absolutely idiotic people are.","i will never understand the profound disrespect people have for people in the medical profession right now.
my mom is an rn, half her office is out either positive or awaiting test results, and patients are coming in with their noses out and trying to take their masks off during exams because ""it's all democrat  anyways"" while my mom and her office are putting themselves on the front line.
it's infuriating and i'm sorry. grief is natural to have and at some point, the wife will have a /r/leopardsatemyface moment and realize that she and her husband both contributed to his early loss.
rant when you need, i can't imagine working in the icu. when my mom had a cardiac arrest earlier this year, she spent a week in the icu and those nurses and doctors (minus the head doctor, who was a ) were some of the kindest and most intelligent people that i've ever met. what you do makes a difference."

my mind just like, broke for a second. i had been talking to myself out loud, but like, that's not that weird. definitely not as weird as what he's doing now. i deadpan stared and said, ""yeah i'm fine"", and he turned around and got back in his car.

"an important part of the new guidelines is the inclusion of hpv co-testing. you likely had your repeat pap in 1 year because they didn't test you for high risk hpv variants the previous time. if they had, then they would have seen the high risk hpv variant and had you do a 1 year follow up, anyway.","as someone who went from a clear pap one year to cin iii/suspected invasion by 13 months later at my next annual, i recommend everyone take these new guidelines with a huge grain of salt.

the reason many doctors ignore these guidelines and require these exams anyways to prescribe contraceptives is quite literally because of, ""the prevailing view in the profession that if women could get their pills without a prescription, they wouldn't come in for annual checkups."" this is a common symptom of the paternalistic view of women patients. (after all, men are never required to, say, have a colonoscopy as a condition of getting blood pressure medication, , or even a vasectomy, even though men are much worse about going to the doctor and getting checkups than women are.)
women don't need to have their birth control pills held hostage to get needed cancer screenings. that's not just my opinion. there's hard data to prove it. an interesting article on this topic: [many doctors are denying birth control to those who won't take cervical screenings -- even though it's not medically necessary]().
fyi to any american women who are reading: **pap smears are only recommended every 3-5 years**, depending on age and history. [this]() is an article from 2012 when they changed the guidelines, but it talks about how overtesting results in unnecessary treatment that can cause complications and problems for women down the road.

grizzlies are the  psychos of the bear world to begin with.,"in most of the us, the animals only want your food and have no interest in harming you. if you're at a formal campground, they often have bear boxes, which are metal boxes that you drop your food into and then lock with a padlock overnight. in the backcountry, you just carry some old climbing rope with you and create a bear hang that suspends your food 20+ feet in the air and not within reach of any tree limbs that will hold a bear. you can even store food in your car in most places.

"for sure this^, if she didn't try to chase away the raccoons then they probably wouldn't have bothered her, not blaming op, just trying to educate people about wildlife. the only reason a raccoon would be aggressive towards humans is starvation, babies, or rabies. but campgrounds are rampant with semi-tame wildlife, i've had mountain goats, deer, and bears come into my campsites because people leave food out regularly, but they weren't aggressive. generally wildlife has a policy of ""don't start , won't be shit"" ...except grizzlies and wild cats, i wouldn't stick around for them.","in most of the us, the animals only want your food and have no interest in harming you. if you're at a formal campground, they often have bear boxes, which are metal boxes that you drop your food into and then lock with a padlock overnight. in the backcountry, you just carry some old climbing rope with you and create a bear hang that suspends your food 20+ feet in the air and not within reach of any tree limbs that will hold a bear. you can even store food in your car in most places.

this is why we don't feed wild animals! especially not from a car. i've seen too many animals hanging around on the road in national parks because they're used to being fed there. they eventually get run over. feeding them isn't helping them. it's ensuring they will be killed by humans.,"it's really not dangerous. raccoons will only actually fight when cornered, they will not fight you for food. good chance those ones have been fed by other campers and were more begging than being aggressive. her emotional distress may have set them off though. bears generally stay away from campsites except in spring when they are really  hungry. wolves stay far the  away from people.
her  situation cause by an abusive  definitely made things much, much worse. being alone in the woods you are infinitely more likely to die from exposure, cold or hunger or thirst than you are to be killed by an encounter with an aggressive animal.","i used to think it would be mad fun backpacking across the us parks.. but i'm australian. sure, everything is trying to  you down under - but fk bears! nfw am i camping where bears and wolves and ? feral raccoons? are tryna eat your face?!","dude he tried to  you, no one leaves someone alone in the woods like that and thinks ""nah it's cool she'll be fine.""",you really think i should?,"oh, definitely call the probation officer. that guy deserves to be put in his place, hard.",if he  around with me or shows up at my house i will. or call his  probation officer. he shouldn't even have been drinking to begin with,"you're handling this perfectly. the  sounds dangerous though, so my advice would be to never be alone with him again for any reason. possibly even get a restraining order."

planned parenthood, as well as other companies like the pill club and nurx, can prescribe and ship birth control to your door. usually a pack of pills costs about $20 through these services.

the [texas equal access fund]() provides support and resources for those seeking an abortion.
costco sells plan b for under $10.
the law also has a whole thing about how if someone is even *suspected* of helping someone get an abortion, they can get sued for up to $10k. the law allows non-texans to get sued for this as well. if you need to seek an abortion after september and need help, be as careful as you can to prevent yourself or others from getting implicated."

"> but putin's choice to aggressively enter the ukraine was not just a result of his authoritarian regime. it was a result of a long disputed trade issue that ended up with russia being backed into a corner in 2014. putin's support of trump is based on all of this.
the number one reason russia was being backed into a corner was its neighbors and most of the western world have no love or trust for authoritarian russian governments. putin doesn't need to expand militarily into the rest of europe if he can just switch off their gas to get concessions. for the same reason, any other moves he makes to increase russia's own power or weaken the states around him ultimately have the effect of projecting that power farther into europe and the rest of the world. it's not like the economic dispute takes place in a vacuum.
there's one other possibility you're ruling out. trump has been soft on nato in public. if vacationing russian soldiers turned up in one or more of the baltic states, and they call for help, and trump doesn't fight back, that's it, nato's broken. russia becomes the dominant military force in the region. again, it doesn't mean there will be russian tanks in berlin the next day, but that's because he doesn't need to invade everyone to dominate them.
putin wants to be stronger than everyone around him so that when he *does* want something, they give it to him or are unable to stop him from taking it. most of the countries around him want something better than ussr 2.0 so they keep trying to block him.
i'll only add that i admire a lot about russia and hoped they were on course to slowly come together peacefully with europe despite their internal setbacks, until they turned back to armed force to advance their goals. and now they've bumped trump into the white house. it's a sad state of affairs.","the us backing down in syria would allow russia to have a navel base located within the mediterranean which allows it to flex it's military strength a lot more. this is concerning.
but putin's choice to aggressively enter the ukraine was not just a result of his authoritarian regime. it was a result of a long disputed trade issue that ended up with russia being backed into a corner in 2014. putin's support of trump is based on all of this.
the result of the recent election will potentially mean that the us will back down in syria and saudi backed pipelines will no longer attempt to supply europe via syria. russia will have no need to push into bordering eu countries if they secure this deal with trump.","> europe's dependence on russian gas is vital to russia's economy.
that also gives russia significant political leverage on top of its military strength, leverage it's never been afraid to use over weaker states. understandably, eu nations, particularly in eastern europe, would prefer a us-eu energy supply over a russian one.
there are no saints in international politics, but putin's responsible for bringing armed conflict back into europe after a long period of peace. his domestic rule is firmly authoritarian in the same direction trump's campaign rhetoric pointed. he's not the kind of leader whose freer neighbors would feel comfortable trusting him with their own futures.",becuase the eu and the us have been throttling russian gas trade. europe's dependence on russian gas is vital to russia's economy. disputes between ukraine gas pricing (backed by the eu) prompted this push into the ukraine. this is also part of the reason that clinton and putin are so involved in syria. the plan was to completely remove europe's dependency on russian gas by building pipelines through syria.,mmm i wonder why russia is so friendly with trump. maybe because trump will allow putin to further press their way into eastern europe.,"not really - once the trump supporters get a taste of actual trumpland, they'll be clamoring for impeachment. they voted for him because he promised them the moon and the sun and the stars, and they thought he could actually deliver.",it would be career suicide for republicans to try to impeach trump.,"also increases the chances of trump being impeached (by republicans in congress who hate him), and regarding the prospect of pence becoming president, i mean, he's the shadow president anyway, so it doesn't make any difference."

if we are to start real inter-gender discussion then we need to accept suffering that both genders experience. not to deny though that women experience it at higher rates, especially outside western europe","agreed. if it's not a man i personally care about, his feelings can take a back seat to what we deal with day in and day out. being a woman is an emotionally abusive experience and the fact there are so many male voices on this sub, in an of itself, proves that. tack on the actual physical abuse that occurs to so many of us. but oooooh don't mention that because some man is gonna roll in with his anecdote on the time a woman abused him.","right?? who gives a  if they want validation and ? they do this to themselves. they stalk women in non-social venues. pin all kinds of unreasonable expectations on a woman who is barely civil in class or at work. lash out when they aren't noticed and appreciated for existing. continually put women down for every fashion and career and hobby choice women make.
the men who relate to women as people are doing just fine and are loved and appreciated. i have nothing left for men who regard women as a means to an end, as bangmaids. a good, solid man is a terrific companion. entitled, conservative men are worth about three cats, max.","no no no. you're missing the point. there isn't anything more tragic than the ""older"" woman who isn't married-- they need to be saved from a life of cat friends /s
i don't care what they think. i don't care if they are lonely for legit reasons or not to be honest. i'm hoping younger women can deprogram their brains quicker than i did.","because you don't see men as a means to an end. you see them as whole people, independent and self-sufficient with hobbies and interests and infinite paths to choose. no limits.
men don't see women the same way. they assume women are waiting to be picked, waiting for motherhood and baking and cleaning. need evidence? visit any pick up or men's sub and watch how men chastise women who reject or ignore them. read how men demand attention and compliments. watch them claim childfree women will spend their middle aged and elderly years lonely and miserable because their destiny and purpose is motherhood.
watch them blame women for failing to validate them, blame women for sa and catcalling. make fun of women for fashion choices and going to the gym.
in short, who gives a  what they think? they limit women to subservient, subordinate roles to men. let those men wallow and suffer alone. they can choose to treat women as human beings with the same natural rights to happiness and autonomy. those who don't?

"they do get information on what the total charges were and how much you are disputing as well. so yes, they can figure it out if they keep good enough records and are willing to spend the time to go through their records.
it really depends on how much information you gave the vendor. it also kind of depends on how many of these credit care disputes they get.","thank you for responding!
can the company not cross-reference the disputed amount with the charges in their customer database?
based on their responses to the google reviews, i wouldn't be surprised if they retaliated out of petty spite.","my parents owned a small business, and as a result i got a chance to read over and respond to the disputes. the merchants don't get information like your name, address, phone number or anything. of your credit card number, the middle 8 digits are x'ed out. they get to see the reasons why you are disputing the charge and some basic instructions on how the merchant can respond with their side of the story. if they don't respond, you win by default (provided the dispute resolution agent can fit your complaints into a valid category).
there is a risk of retaliation, but it somewhat depends on what information you gave them already. if you didn't leave your name or address, then there's almost no chance of it happening.
of the credit card disputes i've been involved in (which admittedly isn't much), there hasn't been any retaliation.
further, from a merchant's perspective, it kind of doesn't make sense to retaliate. the money's gone. retaliation won't bring back the disputed charges, can result in more bad reviews, and can land them in trouble with the law. it isn't worth it for a business owner. and the employees certainly aren't going to care enough to retaliate.",my only concern is that once my cc does the chargeback they'll know my identity and may attempt to retaliate against me.,i've gone this route myself and then helped friends and family resolve disputes as well a handful of times. the credit card dispute resolution is very consumer friendly.,thank you for your advice. i'm more seriously considering this route now.,"they won't i promise. they just mention you were scammed and they'll guide you through the steps to get it refunded. i wouldn't trust this company if they make people sign ndas and hire  makeup artists.
like teen girls can do makeup and hair better than whatever laughable people they have there? i saw the reviews with some edited pictures - wow are so so bad. the skin smoothing is soo obvious and kinda fake looking. i wonder if all their business is through prizes
edit: looking at the website, that artist definitely needs more training. everyone has the exact same makeup look, lip shape, brows. no wings, no creativity. simple makeup from a beginner",i can't even imagine trying to approach my cc company about this...i feel like they'll just laugh me off the phone lol
:( but also thank you for having a conscience!,"haha, i would hope to able to name every tactic, i paid thousands of dollars to be taught that ""system"". i just never had the heart to actually implement it, which is when i realized i will never be really wealthy.","holy , you identified every single thing they did! no joke, that is insane and incredibly evil. i'm actually shocked right now that you were able to name every single tactic and strategy they used from beginning to end. i'm very impressed.","if they post their prices, it allows you to price-shop. there is literally more than one training package (i paid to do one) where they teach this. it's called ips (in person selling, super creative /s) and relies on holding your images hostage, together with every single dodgy sales technique to pressure you into buying a package.
i'll wager they used reciprocality ( i gave you a shoot, you owe me one), the sunk cost fallacy (well you've already spent the time/effort, and you wouldn't want to lose that, right?). not to mention going through each and every image, taking over an hour, and wearing you down until you would give them your money simply to get out of there.
it's a ""sales system"", and it's evil.","it definitely felt like the owner (who is male) set this up to purposefully be disingenuous. also, why don't they post the prices on their website? how is that so hard to do?","i genuinely feel bad for you. photographers like this ruin the industry, for both the customer and other photographers. and yes, the fake claim of ""female empowerment"" is particularly grating as this was a male photographer exploiting a power dynamic to rip you off.","i think if only one or two aspects had been bad, i would've been able to look beyond that and still enjoy myself and the end results. but to have so many things leave a terrible taste in my mouth, end up with photos i absolutely dislike, and to come out of it feeling so bad about myself because they didn't listen to me at all, is literally the opposite of what they were claiming their photoshoots were all about (which was women's empowerment). yes, way to empower me by not listening to me at all.","me and my wife tried running a boudoir studio for a while, but quit because we couldn't stay afloat without these predatory business practices, such as the ""free "" shoot that is anything but.
sorry to hear about your bad experiences, but from the business side at least, this is par for the course.
the mua/pinterest complaints are very valid though. if they want to charge premium prices ( which they do) then they have to provide a premium experience.
we still do it for fun, and if you were in new zealand i'd offer to do a shoot for you, but you may have success going on to photography groups and looking for people who do it for the love of the game, instead of just as a paycheck. that opens up a slew of other issues (like pervs posing as photographers) so i do feel compassion for women who simply want good shots at a decent price."

here's the *entire* rest of the point that everyone seems to miss:
>when it comes to actual messaging, women shift their expectations only just slightly ahead of the curve, which is a healthier pattern than guys' pursuing the all-but-unattainable.
women message men at a rate that's on a pretty realistic bell curve, even though they're not ""rating"" them as highly. it's men who only reach out to the ""hottest"" women.
and just another big obvious point: look at the ""average"" women's pics in the post. they're posed. well lit. the women are wearing nice clothes. an effort was made. the photos are showing these women at their best, they're flattering.
look at the example men's pics in the post. one has red eye ffs. they're not posed or well-lit. only one out of four comes close, in my opinion, to showing how attractive that dude probably is irl.
what this actually shows is that women do not think men's *profile pictures* are very flattering.
and i'd ask anyone who's ever glanced at a dating site, do you honestly think they are? do you think men usually put effort into their pics?

"maybe it's just me, but my general impression is that men generally don't do pictures like women. watching the timeline of posts from acquaintances (not ""influencers"", celebrities, or advertisers), women largely outnumber men in sharing pictures of people.","i doubt it's an intentional effort 'not to show you care that much'. more like they use that as an excuse not to put in the work.
i get it, it's difficult to put yourself out there. maybe you're shy or lack confidence, maybe you have a hard time with all this. but again, that's when you ask friends for help. or family. if you don't have anyone in your life that supports you, you may be a lovely person but you need to work on developing your interpersonal skills before you get yourself into a relationship.
but most guys are just being lazy. maybe it's 30% fear, 70% laziness. and it can turn into this angry 'take me as i am' kind of attitude. one that extends to the rest of their life. chances are they don't exactly take much time to clean their house. or themselves. and honestly, even when i was younger and stupider, i didn't have time for that .","i was kind of wondering if there was an intentional effort to try to appear not to ""care too much"", but the last time i commented about this on reddit i was unironically yelled at about how unreasonable it is to expect a man to get a nice pic, outdoors, in decent clothes.

"love how you can speak for all men and putting down ""women like me"" for having reasonable standards and trying to fear monger me for the time i get older. what are you projecting onto me?
there's a multitude of reasons for men or women being single or not. ever thought that more older women are single by choice because they prefer it that way because the relationship before wasn't working anymore and men stay in the relationship because it benefits them more emotionally?
there are multiple variables playing into this. women also tend to live longer than men, among the single women over 65 are most likely also quite a lot of widows. how does the percentage of single people say anything about their desirability anyway? there are people who are desirable, but who are still single. some people just get into relationships out of fear of being alone or for stability.
i don't even actively date at my current age, so if i were a guy, my life would pretty much be the same because i don't date either way. or at least i'm not actively looking.
i've seen so many socalled average joes having girlfriends and being generally quite successful with dating. and no, they're not the top 10% of men, they're your everyday guy from next door that don't really stand out from the mass, but they found someone that matches them.
it's usually the ones being insecure or having poor social skills who might have a depressing experience with dating, men or women. or they just had bad luck.
all i said was that you shouldn't depend your happiness on a relationship and this applies to every  and you're coming with statistics to proove that women become less desirable among the broad mass, even though no one was talking about this.
my point still stands regardless.
it's far more complicated than ""young women are too picky because they're still pretty and have more options until they get older"". numbers are not telling the whole story.","what exactly implies that i think too high of myself? because i said that i enjoy my own company and don't let myself pressure into a relationship? please.
also since when is online dating reflective of the real world? tinder works much differently than meeting someone in the real world and most people only use tinder for hookups anyway.
it could be that women's desirability on online dating declines more after a certain age compared to men's desirability, but why would i care? i don't use online dating anyway and when i'm older, i don't want anything to do with men in their midlife crisis who look for women the same age as their daughter or niece.
like if less men are into me when i'm older, it doesn't matter because it only takes one person to click with for a relationship. quality over quantity.","girl even in online dating it's show women have much much steeper decline in desirability compared to men their age .that women when they are in their 40s men start becoming more desirable than them in dating(if you want to me to link the studies i can do it.they are reliable they have 200k big  sample size)
this literally online dating the platform that women 90% the power in dating.
i actually think older women are extremely attractive i don't believe this incel rehotic that women age badly .
but ask in guy in their 30s and tell them how dating was in their early 20s and they probably will have ptsd from how young women pickinees.
. i agree with all your statements and i don't side you friend but you seem to think too high of your self because you think you're independent women who enjoy her time alone. but let's be serious try being average joe in his 20s and let's see how you respond to loneliness and singleness.
tldr: i agree with you in everything in this post but i still think you're pretentious young beautiful woman who say that she enjoy being single and say ""singleness isn't bad"" because she has power in dating over men because she is attractive young women.
that why i'm telling you get old and let's see how you respond to singleness when men start being picky.","don't even try the old ""hitting the wall in your 30s"" line like women turn into  hags the day they turn 35, that's bs.
men have their right to be picky as much as i do and if they don't want me, they don't want me. if i don't want them, i don't want them, simple as that. there will always be people willing to date, no matter at what age and if an older guy only wants to date younger women, so be it. you say yourself they're apparently , so why would i want to be with them then? if a man in his mid 30s has unrealistic expectations, that's not a man, that's a manchild.
i like cats btw.",">is he physically attractive?
eh, he looks alright, average, i'd say, but not my type at all.
>is he trying to be your ""nice guy""?
i hope not, and i don't have a bf.
>how's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' pov? where is him empathy?
he is able to understand others' pov, but when it comes to this topic, he has tunnel vision, unfortunately. usually, he is kind, takes care of his friends, is considerate towards everyone. it's not as black and white and it seems like once the topic of being alone is mentioned, his inner demons come out. i understand your sentiment though and appreciate your empathy with me! i'll set much stronger boundaries with him for sure.","how's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' pov? where is him empathy? is he physically attractive? he literally treats half of the population as subhuman. is he trying to be your ""nice guy""? do you have a bf? once you have a bf, he probably will be mad at you, disappear and talk smack behind you.","oof you read him like an open book
he is pretty much looking for someone doing the emotional labor. during the conversation, i felt like he was dumping all his sorrow onto me and i could just try to shield it off of me, without any consideration of how it makes me feel when i try to encourage him and he just keeps wallowing in self pity.
i mean i don't think he's deliberately trying to manipulate, but more or less subconsciously. but i think you're right, i had a similar talk with him this summer and what triggered it was that while we were talking about the topic of dating and whether love at first sight is a thing or not, i said that attraction at first sight is definitely a thing and that i do pay attention to the way a guy looks and the way he carries himself.
meaning i want to be physically attracted. i didn't mean i want my man to look like some sort of model, just someone who i find cute in his own imperfect way. of course personality is important, but i do need that attraction, the chemistry. not that much of a revolutionary concept, isn't it? lol to him it apparently is.
it could very well be that this completely normal statement made him mad because it showed him that women care about more than the bare minimum and are not as desperate as him. just like with my best friend ""emily"" from the post, just hearing that a woman is also able to be happy without a man made him bitter enough to react like that.
coming to think of it, he is talking a lot about financial topics and his plans in that regard and is always talking endlessly about the details of a certain topic that could have been compressed into one or two sentences (to a point where no one is even really listening anymore because no one cares that much) and to lowkey try to impress people with his intelligence.
the thing is, apart from that he's a good guy, but he has a  ton of issues he needs to unpack, but he doesn't realize that. otherwise he's fun to be around but whenever that topic comes up, it's exhausting. i feel kinda torn because i don't want to ditch him as a person completely, but if he keeps getting on my nerves like that, i have to ask myself if i want to keep hanging out with a guy like that or have an honest talk with him. because dating wise, i'd never entertain a guy like him either.","he sounds like a typical low emotional intelligence guy to me. instead of working and self reflecting he just continues the denial and it snowballs into inceldom.
men like this are desperate because they're relying on their partner to fulfill a lot of their needs. self acceptance, stability.. sometimes even entertainment. so not having a partner is just him bouncing to one side of the room to the other because he can't work on his own self acceptance or entertain himself properly. he desperately doesn't want to be ""alone"" because he dumps basic human needs on women. it's like walking around with a huge basket of dirty clothes and crying that you need it washed asap (only by a woman) because you never bothered to learn how to do it yourself.
these guys also love to strategize relationships because they don't see the other gender as an equal. it's always a red flag when someone is ok with potentially ""manipulating"" their way into having and maintaining a relationship. like pick up artist culture.
of course he is not going to like women having their own standards and wanting to be with attractive men.. that means he can't control or manipulate them into dating him. they use money/income, social status, ""intelligence"" as date baits and it's pathetic.
i don't think it's worth the time and effort to deal with these guys anymore, seriously. they're tricky and insecure enough to try to bring you down with them."

"they had 59/60 in 2008. 50 for the past 2 years. way more than the 50/51 they won't have in january. there needs to be more progressive, active, aggressive democrats. unfortunately there are very few of those, and we are going to keep losing ground no matter how hard we pull the blue lever. progressives need to step up and accomplish much more.","but in both examples you cite regarding supreme court justices the democrats were powerless, mitch mcconnell was senate majority leader and making the arbitrary rules. the hypocrisy was obvious but voters didn't hold him accountable for it and he was reelected.
there are plenty of things that i believe democrats would do if given enough representation in congress while holding the presidency. codifying roe into law for starters, then longer term gains could start to be made on climate change. they could attempt to rebalance the landscape by putting term limits on justices, granting the option of statehood to puerto rico and dc, and electoral college reforms. i think these are the types of things you refer to as what the right does that you say the left isn't willing to do. i think we are at the point that it would get done if the votes were there but we absolutely need more democrats in congress to test that theory. if they have the numbers but still don't deliver then i'll agree with you, but so far i don't really think they've had the chance.","trump sets the mood, the agenda.

do i have some ideas as to what should be done? sure, but they probably aren't very good. here's the thing. it's not my job, i'm an engineer, not a politician. my complaint is that the people we elect, the people whose job it is to do these things, they aren't good at their jobs. they're making almost no progress. even bernie, who i think is the bare minimum of progressive that we need, just hasn't shifted things much.
if i were as effective in my job as the democrats are, the people who employ me would sit me down and say something like ""hey, you're not really making things that work here, what needs to be done to fix that?"". it's a conversation that needs to be had with politicians. we make too many excuses for why things aren't progressing rather than trying to actually make progress.","i don't necessarily think from a legislative standpoint trump had that much of an impact. obviously he was and is terrible for the country and the hateful rhetoric is very damaging, but it's not as though he had that much of a legal impact. the supreme court appointees are largely what got us into the mess that started this discussion but 50+ senators approved each one as well so there's more accountability than just trump.
you still don't give any actual steps though that democrats should be taking to create the progress we're looking for.","it cuts both ways. you can't say presidential power is limited and then say trump is  everything up (he is, because it isn't nearly as limited as it should be).
look at all the damage that the recent 3 or 4 republicans did and compare to the good that the recent 3/4 democrats did. it's completely unbalanced. pitifully so. sure we get a sliver of progress every so often ( marriage... and.. umm....) but for every one of those, you get a tidal wave of regression.
the worst of it is that progressive ideals and policies would truly help 90% or more of the country, but democrats pursue these things so poorly that a substantial number of people fight it tooth and nail, and a large chunk of people who would be for it are so unenthusiastic about it that they don't give it a second thought.","presidential power is fairly limited in the grand scheme of things.
i'd be interested in hearing how you recommend ""they"" accomplish anything since you allege they are doing things the hard way.","oh horseshit. if there was ever any president who was as far left as reagan, bush and trump were as far right, things would be a lot better around here. what obama was supposed to be during his first term (not what he actually wound up being)
the right keeps getting their way playing the game their way and what passes for their opposition is so busy trying to do things the hard way that they never accomplish anything progressive.",there really hasn't ever been an opportunity to codify roe. the political system being how it is the votes have never been there. unfortunately it often takes rights coming under direct attack to accomplish anything and democrats are the only chance at making positive change.

anyway i feel your frustration with the democrats. it always feels like they're doing nothing but it's more like the opposition they have is fierce and the 24 hour news cycle buries any failed activity. i would totally vote more left if we had a better system of voting but i personally cannot gamble with a vote that might help the gop even if i don't agree with the democrats.","*thank you!* much appreciated. it appears that i was wrong, and i'm glad you brought that to my attention! cheers

here's one about the virginia state government. i can't find the actual news itself, just a politifact article talking about it as a footnote against an abortion ban that democrats blocked.
it may not have been literally every year but they have tried repeatedly to pass these laws and they always get blocked. sometimes a democrat votes to block these but afaict it's never made a difference.
finding anything older is difficult as search results regarding abortion are completely poisoned right now by seo for more recent news as well as corporate censorship wrt limiting knowledge on how to safely get abortions.

overall, democrats believe in more government assistance to the general public and republicans believe in less. that's the main fundamental difference between the two. from that fundamental difference, i am a republican, because i believe in that fundamental belief. how they feel in a given year about a particular issue is a different matter and people are given the choice each year if they want to stand with their party or not based on those issues.","i hate to break this to you, but the republican party is entirely flawed. i left it for a reason. banning abortion nationwide is a goal of today's gop. if you're in the gop, you're okay with that goal.

>i always have a pretty good hard separation of people i can see having friendships with and people i'd have a  relationship with
i can understand that. to me though, the possibility is always there. i don't really picture a romantic relationship as a  relationship though, the  part of it is more of an ""add-on"" but i also view  relationships a bit different than normal, like i'm perfectly fine with my romantic partner having other  partners so long as they're only  partners, meaning no going on dates, etc. that's definitely not the norm though.
i guess you can say that i compartmentalize the different aspects of a relationship and am capable of viewing them more individually rather than entirely holistic though they are obviously all connected in a relationship as well.

>whether you like it or not, from the very second you meet someone your brain is already trying to figure out where to place them in your hierarchy of relationships.
not necessarily. i tend to go into all relationships as friendships. but that's a me thing, as i'm not really interested in romantic relationships. i always have a pretty good hard separation of people i can see having friendships with and people i'd have a  relationship with (and of course there's overlap there, fwbs etc.). but i guess i'm an outlier in this; i know my disinterest in romance isn't the norm, i accept that (also i'm a widower. i just have no interest in ever being in a romantic relationship with another person)",">so, as one guy to another, i gotta say..your mindset might seem innocent but it genuinely seems like you're getting into friend groups in the hopes of romantic encounters developing, with people who aren't aware of this (but who might suspect it) and that isn't really fair to the people who just want their friends to be friends. honesty goes a long way my dude.
but this is kind of an ""unwritten rule"" dictated by human nature. you don't start off loving someone, you *fall* in love with them over time so naturally you're most likely to develop feelings for people you spend the most time with, ie; people within your friend group.
>the issue with your stance of ""building friends groups of potential partners""
i thought i clarified this pretty well, i don't build friend groups of potential partners and i certainly don't add people to a friend group solely because i view them as a potential partner, i add them to my friend group because we inherently connect as friends, meaning we have commonalities in our likes and dislikes and our personalities seem to mend pretty well. most people wouldn't be friends with someone they have nothing in common with and can't stand their personality.
a recipe for a good friendship has tons of similarities to a recipe for a good romantic partner which is exactly why people tend to develop romantic feelings for someone within the friend group.
i might've worded things bad in my last comment, but i don't go ""i haven't tried a relationship with mary, let's give her a shot because we work together well as friends"", it's more of being cognizant of the feelings that are organically devolping (or not).
whether you like it or not, from the very second you meet someone your brain is already trying to figure out where to place them in your hierarchy of relationships. this is constantly being evaluated and adjusted on a per person basis typically based on shared events with said person. now who do you have the most interactions with, thus the most likelihood of their position being adjusted in your hierarchy? that's right, your friends.
because of this, there's always an inherent potential of developing feelings for someone within your friend group. which is why it's pretty ridiculous to verbally aknowledge the disclaimer of ""hey, i don't have feelings for you right now and i may never, but there's always the possibility that someday i might"". like that is literally the case 100% of the time.","the validity of your point is directly proportional to how honest you are with your intentions. the issue with your stance of ""building friends groups of potential partners"" is are the potential partners willing and consenting participants to your goal of basically trying to find a partner within a friend group ?
like, people get into relationships with their friends.  my friend group's relationship rate is a bit redonk, but we're all nearly 40 and have known each other since high school for the most part, and while some have dated others (repeatedly over the years lol), but there's an honesty there. but when you get into a new friendship - anyone, man or woman - there is usually an undercurrent of wondering on intentions (especially on the women's part) and it's important to be clear in that regard. so many women feel blindsided and manipulated by who they thought were friends, real friends! who it turns out they wanted more. they never lead them on, gave them any indicator, but because they were friends, they were emotionally open and loving..and a lot of men take this as romantic interest.
so, as one guy to another, i gotta say..your mindset might seem innocent but it genuinely seems like you're getting into friend groups in the hopes of romantic encounters developing, with people who aren't aware of this (but who might suspect it) and that isn't really fair to the people who just want their friends to be friends. honesty goes a long way my dude.",">they enter into these friendships because they are hoping to pivot it to a romance.
i want to address this a bit. i don't really have an interest in going on random dates with people i don't know, what i prefer is to be friends first before i dedicate time into building a romantic relationship. the reason being is that the likelihood of a romantic relationship working with someone you already know you click with is far more likely (but obviously not impossible) than with a stranger you met or tinder.
so what tends to happen is that i look to friend groups for potential romantic partners. now this doesn't mean i'm only friends with someone because i may potentially want to date them, i'm genuinely friends with people because at the time, that's all i was interested in. as the friendships build i may or may not want something more.","the issue is too many lads (am guy btw) enter into these relationships facetiously. they enter into these friendships because they are hoping to pivot it to a romance. it's so horrible. i don't know a single woman who doesn't have an example of a guy who she thought was a friend trying to turn it into something else. media has a big hand in this with all the romance  and ""she'll love you eventually"" type  (i'm gonna stop here coz i can rant on this subject for a while lol).
and yeah the adult way, people think it's the end of the world. too many guys are putting too many eggs in their emotional baskets, and building these fantasies in their heads, only to be absolutely crushed about something that never was! and yeah there's issues about a lack of - emotional i forget the term, when men are lacking in it - but that's not on women either. women shouldn't need to be on guard all the time worrying if a guy friend is gonna ""fall"" for them because they shown a bit of emotional affection.
anecdotal as  and i'm aware of it but i blame young kids not playing more with opposite genders. all lads i know with emotional maturity had girl friends growing up, and have women as actual friends in the friend group.
(also jesus christ live with women friends for a while. that'll shut that fantasy  right down. you wanna get a sense of how normal people are live with em for a while lol)","i agree if she doesn't want a relationship and you do and it's clear that's not going to happen best to just  the relationship all together. or at least put it on hold for a good long while.
i don't understand why it's that difficult to grasp.
""sorry, i can't help but have feelings that move beyond platonic for you so i think it's best we not pursue any relationship for the time being. maybe in the future things will be different but for now this is best.
super clear, respectful and tells them point blank that their further attempts to engage with you are just going to cause more pain. easy nuff."
"i get what you're saying, and i can only speak for myself.
i trust my wife completely. she's back in school studying in a male dominated field and she's hung out with some of the guys that she's friends without outside of class on several occasions.
i also know some guys, like my former friend, won't hesitate to burn someone they've been friends with for *years* to get something they want, so i would be lying if i said i haven't internally had concerns when she's mentioned it. that said i trust her judgement and didn't say or do anything even though i hadn't met them. when i did finally meet them, i did of course realize i was right to trust her.","thats really . they are absolutely both to blame equally but i kind of know what you mean.
i think what bothers me most is theres an implied lack of trust in me. i hope that makes sense? (looong day)","my last ex-gf (over 10 years ago now) cheated on me with as someone i thought was a good friend of mine.
they're both to blame imho, but i understand why men distrust other men.","i think it's insecurity and its learned through a culture of misogyny. they are so so painfully insecure about other men's intentions. i've def dated a dud or two, but even the few who are generally reasonable and mature people have this weird complex about this. i dont think they themselves believe women are just for /romancing, but they believe that all other men think like this.","that really says more about those guys she's dating than her. i'm not sure i'd trust a guy who thinks that men only are interested in women for , because that's probably how he feels too.","its a fair assumption. your situation is unique, because as ""ex's"" - you and your bff probably already had  - so no more mystery to it.
most guys will assume if it happened before, could probably happen again.","came here to say this. it hurts to open up to a person only to find out that they're waiting for something from you.
i have one close (straight) male friend for this exact reason. weirdly he is an ex, but i think that is exactly why it works well - we mutually agreed that it wasnt working but that we genuinely cared about each other. over 15yrs later and zero regrets... it's a bit tricky with relationships though. his wife is cool cos we all grew up together, but i dont think i've ever had a partner that trusted the situation.... because they all seem to think the only reason a man hangs around a women is to get their  wet","i've started explaining to people who use this term that it really sucks to be ""girlfriend zoned"" or even ""fuck zoned""."
"you really clearly don't though - i'm saying that there's a small subset of makeup that is attached to ""partiarchal bs"" and there's other styles that absolutely go against it due to it being viewed as ""excessive"".
that's what i'm talking about - not makeup as a whole, but the styles that inherently clash with the patriarchal desires, workplace standards, and what is considered ""attractive"" by the general male population.
also, on a note about hijab - it's empowering in western nations where it would be easier for women to forsake wearing it because wearing it inherently brings judgement upon them from those that dislike muslims/islam. it places their religion and culture unashamedly in the front of people's minds - it's about their choice and not conforming to what is considered the ""norm"" while embracing their religion.
everything needs to be taken in context of the situation where the person is, their intentions, and what exactly the ""style"" of what they're doing is - nothing is in a bubble. wearing makeup in a style that contrasts the ""accepted"" norm results in women being mocked and attempts to enforce them wearing the ""accepted"" styles, as does wearing hijab in areas where that's not considered the norm and there's potentially islamophobia present.
 judging people for femininity, and  judging people for not ""conforming"" to femininity. that's basically my feelings - i don't feel like anyone should be judged or criticised on either side because it just devolves into women tearing down other women because they're ""too feminine"" or ""not feminine enough"". the judgement goes in both ways, it's not just from feminity spaces.","i do understand you. makeup can be a means for harmless fun or self expression. its not inherently evil. its just the patriarchal bs attached to it and enforcing it, mocking women who dont care for it. online femininity spaces are full of this stuff. even women treating you poorly just because you dont do performative femininity.","you're not understanding me - there's a range of makeup that is applied, and when you go too far with your use of it (i.e. full glam, alternative makeup, etc.) then it's no longer acceptable.
it's sure as  a choice to wear alternative or full glam makeup, because you know that there will be plenty of people judging you (both men and women) because it's seen outside the societal norm.","make up is like hijab, pretty much. it appears as a ""choice"" for some women, but how much of it is actually a choice if your natural face is seen as 'unprofessional', 'ugly' or 'too tired'. or your workplace enforces it on you but not on men.","technically if a woman was to show up in full glam makeup at certain workplaces, she may also be fired.
all of this  depends on the workplace or the male observer - too much makeup is seen as bad, just as no makeup is seen as bad. they're both choices that women can use to express themselves, and aren't necessarily ""conforming"" to the patriarchy.","then how is makeup feminist and empowering, if its just another tool to oppress women?? women are treated as aesthetic objects, men are allowed to be themselves.",employers can legally require women to wear makeup as part of an established dress code; they can impose such restrictions on female employees while not burdening male employees at a similar level.,"ok? so if a woman working in the service and hospitality industry chooses not to wear makeup or high heels, can she get fired?? would a man get fired for not wearing makeup??"

i'm more concerned with messages she's receiving about beauty standards, and about how beauty is still pretty central to the lives of young girls, and what society expects from girls.

but if covid showed up anything, it's that women are still doing the ""second shift"" when they get home, and still hitting the glass ceiling at work.
we'll agree to disagree here.","i think it does, because it means a lot more kids and young people are questioning the gender binary, which means they are open to questioning what it even means to be male or female which has largely been a social construct, which is kind of wonderful. i didn't even know what gender non binary was until a friend (previously female identifying) came out as they/them to me a few years ago. i think it does help cis women, because it directly challenges what the patriarchy is holding up about gender norms, and basically is an f you to this system. it's brave for people to come out as non binary, and it's the first time gender as a social construct has entered the mainstream, and it does help us.
yes, there is still sexism, but besides gender fluidity there are things that are changing. there's more women who are college educated, more households where the woman is the breadwinner (), more kids with openly  parents which, more people coming out as trans and non binary (which you may or may not know about a kid for years), more people seeking treatment for their mental health, more women living their lives on their own and on their own terms. there are more movies and shows directed by women, and this has been awesome because we consume media. yes, there are still bad things. my point, is it's also good to acknowledge the positive changes, because the more we celebrate these changes the more positive impact we have on the world. if we only focus on what is worse, then what does this tell young women? it takes away their power in the world. it's awful roe was overturned, but there are still more of us that support roe it than not. if we want to push back and keep moving forward, we have to acknowledge the progress and continue to push progress. otherwise, we are giving up, and yes, we could lose more rights. but, it's not inevitable if we focus on how we want to shape the world and realize there are many like minded people, who are perhaps, the majority.","okay, i'll give you that. but i don't really think that the fluidity of transgendered or binary youth really has much impact on cis-girls. cis-girls and women don't suffer any less sexism than they did before. for them, things are very much the same, and sometimes, a bit worse.","i would say, for one thing, that are understanding of gender is changing, and this is the big, relevant change of what it even means to be a girl or boy in society. they/them is very common and accepted with young people and even kids, and kids are pretty willing to challenge gender norms in ways that didn't exist before. there's much more fluidity around gender than there used to be.
i would also say there's more acceptance and awareness of mental health and diverging from being neurotypical. so a lot of young people i have worked with are very good at talking about their struggles. this doesn't mean they'd not have struggles, but it's not stuffed down like it was a a generation or so ago. this has been my experience working with gen z. i also have a teenage stepson. the most popular kid in my stepson's middle school was a girl that came out as gender non binary went by they/them and had cool style. it had nothing to do with looks. this is a big change, and would have been unheard of in the 90s or early 2000s. gender non binary did not exist.
i'm not saying it's all better. we don't live in a utopia or equal society. that being said, i am saying our understanding and attitudes towards gender are changing, especially among young people who, frankly, are leading the way on this, and that absolutely has an impact on how kids are expressing themselves. with parents who are supportive, usually, it's good and positive.","how are things truly different for girls?
sure, body and  shaming is less prevalent, but it still happens. i wasn't pressured to send  pictures to boys when i was growing up though, and i didn't have to contend with boys watching  the way they do now in lieu of a  education. rampant sexism was going on when i was growing up, but music gave women a lot of power, and the freedom to be exactly what they wanted to be. remember the lilith faire? there was a certain message about the 90's that i don't really see much today: *it's wonderful to be a woman. celebrate your womanhood.*
i honestly can't really see how things are better today than they were then. i will say that teachers and parents are less tolerant of that  than they were when i was growing up, but that's because it's *we* who have changed, not really kids.
i guess it all depends on what constitutes a good role model.....but i didn't say there weren't any, i just said there were few. and i really do believe that.","i don't disagree there are problems for girls. i'm pointing out that there's been changes, and things are different. that doesn't negate any issues. i just think it's worth considering what progress there has been, and that kids are a bit different than when we grew up (assuming you are a millennial). i definitely don't think all issues have been solved for girls. that would be nuts.
i disagree there aren't role models though."

the problem isn't about just the travel, is it?","in other ways.. everyday things are pretty nice. he makes sure we get to have our date nights, he's more emotionally present and physically present when he isn't working and home. he spends more time with me, he tries to meet my physical needs. i acknowledge all the little things he's done for me.
it's just.. it's bare minimum.. so i'm left feeling like the things i ask for more--aren't being met.
i'm sure he's probably feeling discredited and misunderstood. i'm sure he has complaints about me too; but i just feel like i'm so giving and out there and i wish he'd meet me halfway."

i doubted myself for a bit too. i enjoyed the conversation too so not futile. have a good'un.,"i'm really sorry! i watched this video previously, and despite going back and seeing this warning, i somehow completely missed it that it was youtube's doing. i thought that you were referring to trigger warnings that this creator uses, without actually understanding you.
this argument has been futile and my fault! :(","i was reading it as the video had been slapped with these warnings by youtube, who were basically saying that the content may be false and may mislead the viewer in some way that would have a negative impact on society.
it may be that these content warnings were in fact general trigger warnings that were added by the creator with positive intent.
if it is the latter i retract my previous criticisms, but looking at it again it does seem to be something youtube has added to ward people away as if the video is going to e.g. incite hatred or violence.
you then get into the query of is this similar to censorship or is it more similar to a general age rating as you might see for all movies.","i think you're wrong about content warning being about information, but i'm not 100% sure what it is. here are two options:
1. content warnings means that the medium features content that may be triggering, such as abuse, , substance use. trigger warning is about the discussion of such, without necessarily featuring content. for example, i could have triggered a classmate while talking about abortion, without actually featuring pictures, videos, recordings, written experience of abortion. i should put a trigger warning. if i do have any of these, i should've used a content warning for abortion.
2. content warning is about a medium featuring content that elicits strong negative emotions, such as abuse, , substance use. trigger warning is about a medium featuring content that might elicit a traumatic response in someone. if my discussion includes depiction of excessively harsh criticism, and a classmate has traumatic responses from experiencing excessively harsh criticism, i should have a trigger warning, but not a content warning. i should have a content warning if i depict or mention something that will make most people very uncomfortable. think gordon ramsey calling a cook  and him freezing/crying because of childhood trauma
so when a video contains hate-speech, a content warning would mean ""this video will contain depiction of hatespeech and not just mention it"" or ""i think that most if not all of my audience find the hate speech that i will depict as disturbing, instead of eliciting a traumatic response in only a small part of the audience""","yeh. so this video seemed to have one that basically said ""be careful with the information in this video, it may be false"". that is absolutely ridiculous for this specific video.
the ones that say ""this video touches on topics that may trigger xyz"" are a good thing.",aah. i think i got you now,"regarding content warnings: more or less i have no idea, but different ones. the ones calling out hatred (like this one) really shouldn't have content warnings, and there are far too many genuinely hateful ones that don't have warnings but should.
trigger warnings are a different thing, and are absolutely fine and more videos should have them.","are you saying ""more videos should have tw"" or not?"
that is gold,"gettin' jiggly with it, nah nah nah nah nanah nah nah...","it is now. thank you for the contribution.
commence the jiggly.",i didn't realise my typo until you quoted me just now and that makes it sound even more horrifyingly hilarious hahah. like it's the name of some -wiggle dance.,">do you jiggly your  on her  violently in the same manner that a -stim toy does?
this image is both hilarious and horrifying","hahah, this is so insane! you're not wrong in that he's got the mindset of a teenager. the fact that he's insecure about the size of a toy designed for external stimulation is just so ridiculous to me. in what way would they compare, adam?! do you jiggly your  on her  violently in the same manner that a -stim toy does?
op, you have every right to be mad and your response thus far is completely normal and justified. he's the one being a little  about everything. the fact that he views you as a living fleshlight during  is so horrendously disrespectful.",i just bought the wand a couple of weeks ago and tried it on a couple of times when i was alone. i used it for the first time when the two of us were together a few days ago. i think he noticed that the wand is way bigger than his  and so he got nervous.,">he then angrily asked me if my climaxing was just as important as his, and i replied by saying yes,
this question alone shows that he doesn't consider you  equals. he clearly doesn't consider you climaxing to be as important as him climaxing.
>he was initially fine with me using the bullet in bed earlier. a few days ago, i began using the wand and he just stopped and looked at me with a confused stare. i
did something happen a few days ago or have you never used the wand in bed before? i don't understand why he would suddenly go from accepting your need to have clitoral stimulation to not accepting it."
"what's even weirder was i wasn't calling anyone that. i recommend something that had helped me a lot. it's called ""a n_rcissist's love"" letter by john howell",that's so weird. i thought word came up a lot on that sub.,relationship advice,what? which sub?,"it's narcissistic/ triangulation. they need the op to be involved.

", guess i need to follow some local food trucks. i need this in my life. woefully out of the loop always.","oh yes. we have a hawaiian shaved ice truck that we'd never be able to find if it wasn't for them sharing their location. we've also found many local events because of them. like they'd post ""we'll be over at this event today"" and we're like, there's an event today? well let's check it out.","also for all people like to  about social media in general, its fabulous for local businesses. i love being gently reminded about my favorite local restaurants' weekly specials. or sales, or street fairs or open studio days.","this is how i use twitter, very curated. very narrowly focused on artists and cosplayers.","honestly, i love tiktok. i keep it very curated and i get videos of people weaving interesting baskets, neat cooking tricks, this one woman who repairs loved stuffed animals, permaculture and botany stuff, an interesting guy who rants about pedestrian infrastructure failures, drag queen makeup videos. all of these sites can be horrible. curate it for what you actually want and block what you don't.","eh, i'm 19 and most of my friends - even those older than me - love that app. i can't stand it...one video turns into ten then a hundred and soon enough, your whole day is gone to mindless short clips by people who don't know what they're talking about
edit: word change","tbh i never understood the appeal of tiktok at all, but i'm probably just too old for it","i deleted twitter and tiktok. they've been cesspools for ignorance, hate, and misinformation."
"that's why twitter calls it ""deactivation"", not ""deletion"". deactivating your account will not be subject to the 14 days gdpr law because it's not technically ""deleting"" your account.
in order for twitter to actually remove all of your data from its databases you have to (a) be a citizen requesting from an eu country and (b) actually ask their customer support to delete everything.
source: i help manage global user data for a cloud company and have to do things differently for eu customers.","the law applies both internationally and to private companies. if twitter doesn't pledge to be deleting all user data when an account is requested to be deleted within i believe it's 14 days then it is not legal for them to operate in any eu territory and they can face a fine worth i think it's like 10% of their yearly earnings plus whatever other damages the eu court decides.
twitter can still be accessed from europe so i'm fairly confident they are following this law.","not everyone, including twitter itself, is in the eu. also, now that it's a private company, they might just decide to keep all that data for themselves whether you delete it or not.",if you delete a tweet it's still backed up for 14 days so that changes nothing. just deactivate the account. eu law mandates that all personal data is deleted within a certain amount of time after account deletion.,"this is not true. you have to delete all your tweets otherwise your data is still there. there are 3rd party bots that do it for you because the only way to delete tweets is individually. basically, you have to give the bot your login and password and it goes and runs the script. i learned this after i deleted my 15 year old account when musk announced his intention to buy. gotta nuke it completely otherwise he still gets your data whether you use the site or not.",deactivating is deleting,"hijacking top comment to ask: how do i delete my account?
i never use twitter but i made an account a long time ago and definitely want to delete it. someone please give specific directions (for mobile users) because it's not obvious how to do it. when i went to ""help- account support"" it gave me the run around. eventually it mentioned ""deactivating"" the account, but i'm not sure if that's the same as deleting it.","nah i did this same thing a few days ago aswell. had a friend make a tweet that literally just said ""pedophilia is bad"" and she got ratioed 5 times despite the original tweet having 100 likes from people trying to justify . if musk doesn't actually do something that site is dead."
neat. other people said it but your comment is the one with 800 upvotes and awards. your comment is the the main one op or anyone will see.,that's why others pointed out to wait,"yes but you didn't say that. you said ""he'll never know it was you"", you don't know that.","she should wait couple weeks, as others have pointed out.",you don't know this and that's extremely irresponsible to say to op. you have no idea that he texts other customers or that he's done it recently to someone other than op. it's safe to assume he'd know from context that op is the one who reported him. i'd be worried too that he'd come to my house about it.,you are most likely not the only one. he will never know who reported him.,i'm scared to report him because i don't want something to happen and for him to attack me if he loses his job,"call domino's, or have your parents call, and file a complaint with his manager for harassing a minor. better yet, call corporate or see if you can fill out a survey/complaint online.

 nice,i'm the same. i had an iv removed and they had a cotton ball on and a bandaid over it. i walked out of the hospital and everyone was looking at me. i looked back and there was a trail of blood behind me.,did they not put a cotton ball on it? not that that can catch a whole load of blood most likely,"i'm a really hard stick, and then i bleed everywhere when the needle comes out. when i had surgery recently and they removed my cannula in recovery, i looked down a few minutes later and the whole back of my hand was just red.
i was still a bit out of it so i just stuck my hand in the air and called to the nurse 'sorry to bother you but is this supposed to happen?'",it means you're gonna be easy to put an iv in. there are few things (i think) a nurse hates more than having a super hard stick. i work as an aide with nurses and it's super frustrating when all the nurses on the floor has tried to put an iv into a patient and need to call house because nobody got one in.,"date a nurse, they  love that . at least all the nurses i've met have. there's something about nurses and veins. (yes, the male nurses too)","i'm not a fan of my veins, makes me look sickly. but don't hate it to a point of doing surgery. this guy just made me feel worse about my insecurities.","... i love the look of my veins, they started being more prominent the more fit i got, so i view visible veins as a sign of strength. be veiny and proud!!!!"
"not heated at all, and the psychiatrist i gathered earlier. good luck and be well","i appreciate it as well! while self esteem *can* be indicative of how successful someone will be in life it's actually one of the more shaky ways to determine their success. personality theorists see incongruence between who one is and who one wants to be as a more solid indicator for distress and other similar issues in life. this is where i really think gender roles can hurt people, like you said with your point on nature vs nurture and how they could be passed down by parents. a child who's raised to be a girl that doesn't want to be a ""girl"" (in the context of feminine stereotypes) would probably show a greater incongruence between who she is/pressured by her family to be rather than who she wants to be and that's where you'd see more insecurities or, on the other side, more acting out. (acting out is seen more with authoritarian or negligent parents)
it's also definately frustrating to see it take it's toll on others you know.
though self esteem can be built back up, you're right that it's incredibly difficult to climb out of those types of thinking. with therapy and psychiatry, many times it's not an option that many people can afford or just would be too embarrassed about attending due to how stigmatized it is. there's an incredibly large multitude of factors at play with situations like this and it really depends on the specific situations that lead to seeking out abusive partners, knowingly or otherwise.
if any of this comes off as heated i assure you i don't mean for it to, i just got out of classes so i'm a little fried, also if you want me to clarify anything please ask, i'm studying to be a psychiatrist and love talking about personality theory and child development/psychology","""loser magnets"" are the ladies who say ""why do i always go out with losers"" as you saw it wasn't an insult. i also agree that a woman who's never been in that type of relationship ends up with that personality trait. it's either a family member talking down to (or at) her or radiating off a parent who's witnessed it in their parent, i don't know exactly. i will say it's way to common and until there's some way to teach self-esteem it won't get better, unfortunately. but how, i think that comes from your own successes, win at sports get more confidence playing, same with exams at school, but i hated to see it in some of my daughters friends. i appreciate the dialogue","i'd say you're right that self esteem plays into it, i see it as the result of a self fulfilling prophecy wherein the women who you so hilariously put as 'loser magnets' are that way because they believe they can't do any better. what interests me is what causes women who're neurotypical and haven't gone through trauma/psychological programming by an abuser, to develop that sense of themselves and when it takes form. gender norms seem very pervasive with younger girls, which reminds me of this really great video essay i watched about the book titled 'the care and keeping of you' and how that book used to perpetuate ideas about dressing modestly and that it's not okay to discuss puberty and going through it (for girls of course.)
all this to say that i think you hit the nail on the head and that i believe part of that insecurity for women who hadn't already had it programmed into them is caused by how heavily parents or caregivers adhere to gender roles.
i think the idea of the ought self and the actual self also definately go hand in hand with this but i digress- i'd be happy to try (to the best of my half completed psych degree) to explain those a little more, it's really interesting stuff!","thank you, your thoughts if you don't mind.","this is an interesting comment, i'm just commenting as a bookmark to see how the discussion goes when more people reply!","interesting you say that and here's a theory of mine. i've always said the most attractive trait any woman can have is self-esteem or self-confidence. most real men are not afraid of a successful, intelligent woman but they are attracted to them where insecure ""men"" or i'll say abusive guys avoid them. a woman with little to no self-esteem in fact are loser magnets (is that too harsh?). in that situation the guy sees a woman who won't question him, when asked ""where do you want to go eat?"" will say wherever you want is fine, what movie ""whatever you want to see"" etc. which for that guy is great until it's not. at some point that does get old and that's when he changes and isn't nice any longer, now it's ""can't you make a choice?"" ""why am i always deciding, can't you make an f'in decision?"" etc. and it gets worse from there, i believe that's why so often it's ""he was so nice when we started dating then he changed...."". so a confident woman attract confident men. any replies either agree or disagree?",it really is. what you'll find though is men do exist who value strong women. and the reality is those guys still were formed within and live in a culture that is misogynistic af so they won't always get it right - but when you call them on their  they'll listen and learn.
"i can't, it would ruin the last vote theory :(","you too, just wish you'd vote for the party that's trying to protect our rights.","i appreciate that you're willing to accept it's not all bad (i don't watch fox either i could say cnbc or the view)

ps: friday he said he campaigned for obamacare in all 54 states. true","i strongly disagree with the concept that ""both sides"" are equally bad in these regards. one political party generally tries to promote the protection of marginalized people, one does not. one is significantly better about not spreading misinformation. fox news isn't the republican party, but continues to host tucker carlson, who's rhetoric is alarmist and damaging to public trust, not to mention racist and misogynistic. republican candidates continue to spread rumors about voter fraud in attempts to delegitamize any candidates they don't agree with, while conservative state legislatures try to make voting more difficult. but this is just finger pointing, right? so look at the legislation, look at what politicians from both sides propose and what they vote for. let the actual policies speak for themselves.

">so no, it's not whataboutism by any definition to talk about violence against women and girls (which btw is not the same thing as violence against afab people - violence against afab people includes trans men, and vawg includes trans women, which you seem to be conveniently forgetting in your haste to turn this into two groups competing with each other...).
you were specifically talking about violence against **afab** people
>to women (and enbies) who are **afab**
i said that it isn't because someone is afab vs amab
>i think it's less of an amab vs afab thing
you were the one pitting afab vs amab (a line of distinction that i, as a non-binary person myself, hate). you were the one who in response to a trans* person turned around and said that afab people have it worse. it's no different than those men who turn around and bring up how bad male suicide statistics are, but only in response to people commiserating about misogyny. which is especially egregious when statistics show that ""women who are afab"" don't actually experience violence ""more so"" than trans people (once again, including non-binary people such as op) of **either** agab.
look, i'm going to stop replying here. all you're doing is flipping an uno reverse card and going ""no u"" on the bits that i'm calling out.
edit: and i've been blocked","um, the post also says that op *now understands what women experience* in terms of harassment and violence. so no, it's not whataboutism by any definition to talk about violence against women and girls (which btw is not the same thing as violence against afab people - violence against afab people includes trans men, and vawg includes trans women, which you seem to be *conveniently* forgetting in your haste to turn this into two groups competing with each other...).
this is a lot more complicated than you think it is, and actually unpicking the nuances and challenging some of the assumptions here is a necessary and important thing to do. shutting down discussion and trying to make people compete with each other in the way you are attempting to push for is incredibly unhealthy. literally nothing in my comments is anything but supportive of the op, and it's possible to be supportive *alongside* engaging in a wider discourse. you do not have an absolute right to set the terms of discussion here.
eta: tbh if anyone is dismissive, it's you.","both things are bad, **but** you were the one who said that people are more aggressive to afab people on a post about a non-binary person who was amab, in a reply to a comment talking about how people are particularly awful to amab people who don't conform to such an assumption.
further you posted a link talking about violence against women, and yes, compared to men women are much more likely to be a victim of violence. however, op is not a man, nor were the groups addressed in the comment you replied to (with the exception of femboys, but them being men is secondary to the point being made). i brought up statistics of violence against trans people because non-binary people are definitionally also transgender (with some very rare exceptions where a person may be intersex **and** also raised as such).
honestly your comments come off as a whataboutism and utterly dismissive to the harrassment trans and non-binary people face.","why are you trying to create a comparison between trans people as a group and women as a group? it's not a competition. trans people do face utterly undeserved violence and harassment, that's true. but my comments are specifically about the pandemic of violence against women and girls:
i don't see any need for invidious comparison. **both things are bad.**","honestly, i think it's less of an amab vs afab thing and more of a being a visible minority thing.

"i'm not saying that it's the individual's responsibility to change. i'm well aware of late stage capitalism and the hellscape that it creates. what i'm saying is that it's unfair to expect women to bring home half of the income *and* do the vast majority of the emotional and domestic labor. which is exactly what i said.
yes, i do think if men did the majority of the domestic and emotional labor, then it would very much be viewed differently. what a silly question. of course it would. everything that gets pushed off on women is devalued and given less importance in the heterosexual relationship ""exchange.""","if i'm understanding correctly, in your opinion it's essentially less about the degree or salary itself and more about the assumed contributions to the relationship based on past experience and statistical averages? so if for example a potential partner made less money than you but did the majority of the household work and wasn't an emotional burden, that would be a ""fair trade"" (assuming of course that less income = less hours at work, which isn't a guarantee in the current economy)?
>also expected to have a full-time job and provide half the income
this is probably the only thing you listed that isn't directly the responsibility of individuals to change. time was, a single minimum wage job could support two adults and multiple children. thanks late-stage capitalism and wage stagnation!","because women already do vastly disproportionally more of the emotional and domestic labor in heterosexual relationships and then, on top of that, are also expected to have a full-time job and provide half the income. so, coupling down can be seen as really doing a great disservice to a woman's worth. why even bother saddling yourself with the burden of a ""partner"" when you're the one bringing literally everything to the table?","you're right, college graduates in the us are 60/40 female/male, with the ratio trending female more and more every year. the gender divide has gotten bad enough that some colleges are looking into affirmative action plans that can be taken to increase male attendance/graduation rates.
>women have the choice of dating someone ""lesser""
i asked the person you replied to this, but i'll ask you as well: why is ""dating down"" seen as a bad thing for women?","> women often feel the need to date someone less successful than them or get lost in the dating pool.
that's just a statistics though.
if we limit to something easily measurable like educational achievement then women are the majority of students in tertiary education in (i'm fairly certain) practically every western country.
in my country the disparity is 2 to 1, in the us it's what, 3 to 2? something like that.
assuming the minority sexualities is somewhat evenly spread the women have the choice of dating someone ""lesser"", sharing a man, or being single.","this is totally valid and something i experience in my 30s as well. unfortunately in my opinion, there are not enough black (and potentially latino) men who can keep up to the success of black/latina women. women often feel the need to date someone less successful than them or get lost in the dating pool.","except when it doesn't. i have many black and latina friends who are talented, educated, and attractive who are in their 40s and early 50s who still have this issue.","you are not alone! once you get to a better city, establish a professional life, it will get better. i've honestly had so much better luck dating european guys but that's another convo."

lol. yup! the pool wasn't especially huge where i live.,"if you swiped yes on pretty much everyone, were you actually attracted/interested to pretty much everyone?",i did hear that tinder tends to suppress people who swipe yes on every match so that others don't see them crop up. which possibly  me over a little when i tried using tinder since the women on there mostly all seemed pretty great and it was rare for there to be any overt red flags like open racism in their bio.,"back in the day, when i was used okc the website, you'd be able to see when the user was last active. for the swiping era of online dating, i don't know what they do if you delete the app without deleting your profile - if you even can delete your profile. i know on at least one app i had to make a new profile after deleting the app and later reinstalling it. i also know that on the apps where they don't limit how many folks you can ""like"" per day, there are people who like absoutely everyone without exception, just in case. i'm sure many of my matches fall into that category. i don't know about needing to be a member to message on the mainstream/popular apps but they are always hawking the paid version. the point is, (it feels like) plenty of peope have success despite all these things so it gets really depressing.","this is very much the case. they need to appear to be active and have lots of people who are in the action. so they use tons of bots and fake profiles.
and always push for that golden subscription.","i am not sure the current situation in dating apps so maybe this has changed. but 10 years ago when i was doing this as a male on the big dating site of the time it turned out that a lot of women on the site were not members and thus could not respond. then when i quit the service myself, they kept my profile up even though i cancelled. the only thing i was able to do to keep them from putting my profile up when i was not part of the service was to physically delete the pictures, text etc. why did they do this? well i would get e mails from them saying someone replied to my profile. i could look at the response and profile but if i wished to respond i had to become a paying member. but back then, i know from my personal profile, they are putting profiles up that are not part of the service. they did it repeatedly with mine.
sooo it would not surprise me if some of the profiles people are looking at, responding to may not be real, or be able to respond (as i said, haven't done online dating lately maybe it has changed). so i was sending out all these e mails getting no responses back, taking a hit to the ego in the process. yet i have no idea how many of those folks were actually still on the service and could have replied if they wanted. but the ego took a hit none the less. something to consider if getting no response if they still play these games.","thank you for this. i feel so seen because emphatic disinterest is the most apt description of online dating i've ever heard. for context, i am a woman and i live in a medium-big city, on the east coast.
i get matches on any app/site i use, but i get very few messages and no one ever responds if i intiate. i have friends who will only use bumble, the app where only women can initiate, due to perceptions of safety, but i've never ever had someone i reached out to on bumble respond so i deleted it.
it doesn't matter if i say something low effort like ""hey, how are you?"" or actually put in effort to say something witty/interesting/flirty. people don't respond me. that's not to say that i've never had a reply when i initiated but of all the dates/relationships i've had from dating sites, it's probably 90 percent they reached out and 10 percent i reached out. and people don't initiate very often either. i don't know why there is so little interest in me but it definitely is depressing. sorry, this is not directly related to op but your wording rang so true to me.","i can sort of relate? i'm a guy so the dynamics at play are quite different. but when you do the online dating thing and get met with emphatic disinterest in you, its hard not to internalize that sometimes and make you feel like there's something wrong with you. people sometimes try and give you advice and tell you to revise that profile or that your picture sucks (which can hit hard when its a normal every day picture of you that is really an honest representation of what you look like) , but after putting all that effort in and still zero interest it can hit you even worse.
then sometimes someone will hit you back and normally you would realize this person is absolutely not for you and are actually kind of awful. but then you put up with them making some pretty insulting jokes at your expense and you find yourself trying not to confront them about things they say that you object to because they were willing to at least give you some attention and you don't want to rock the boat."
"i am a black woman. why would i lie about being a black woman? i think you're a troll, why else respond the way you did? not sure what exactly i said that offended you.

black men are fetishizing white women. why would white women choose to play into that?
you don't sound like an ally to black women. how can women stick together when we refuse to support each other?","""you are taking black men away from us""
 am i reading?","knowing most black men date white women then dating black men. yes, you are playing into it. you are taking black men away from us. if all white women stood up for black women then this wouldn't be a problem. black men will never learn if white women keep dating them.","if a guy said to me ""i don't date black women because they are black women"", i wouldn't date him. but if he never brings it up, and otherwise acts normal, and never makes any racist comments, how am i supposed to know? that doesn't mean i'm ""playing into it"".","i agree. i'm black, through research i've discovered only 30% of black women get married. it's because of the racism. most black men don't want black women, they want white or anyone besides black women. white men only want white or any other race than black women. all other races go for the same. the midwest sucks for dating. i'm filtered out of dating apps because the men only want white women. white women play into it because they date these racist men.
religion is also a problem. racism is a lot higher amongst white christians than the non religious.

"i think you really need to study some chinese history to see what the state did in response to religion to make those claims. the ccp were brutal in excising religion from the culture. it wasn't perfect but it was ruthless and extreme.
to suggest that the patriarchy of china is solely about religion while ignoring the atheist, communist ideals of what men and women should do seems illogical and unreasonable.
finally, confucianism being based on confucius as a religion is true. but confucius himself was raised in a patriarchal society. religions don't create the patriarchy, they're just sometimes tools to help enforce it. so are non-religious ideas. thinking the removal of religion would fix anything is foolish, look at china or nk or the soviets.","> and yet they threw it away and maintain patriarchal positions.
they didn't completely ""throw it away"". you can't just erase thousands of years of cultural conditioning overnight, no matter how much the ccp tries.
non-patriarchal religions like wicca were never in power in most places (especially so post-colonialism, when patriarchal societies steamrolled everyone globally) so they're irrelevant for this argument","and yet they threw it away and maintain patriarchal positions. the point again being that religion is not needed to enforce the patriarchy.
there are plenty of non-patriarchal religions too, like wicca.","> nobody would put china ahead of the uk for being less patriarchal, would they?
china also has thousands of years of confucianism (and it's included misogyny) influencing their culture, and cultures across east asia. confucianism was a state religion for thousands of years, and just because it's no longer an official religion doesn't mean there isn't that patriarchal baggage left over.
point is the vast majority of the time if there is a patriarchy, you can usually identify religion as a root cause enforcing it.","that doesn't really bear out in reality. atheist nations are sometimes much worse than religious ones, because the patriarchy has different tools to maintain itself. nobody would put china ahead of the uk for being less patriarchal, would they?",yet even more so when pushed by religions. let's not pretend that's not true.,"incels are found in all cultures, not just religious ones. the patriarchy sits quite happily with the non-religious too.","> people should prob stop raising their kids to believe this.
we're trying. the biggest problem is that too many men are raised in religious households that indoctrinate them in patriarchy. they're told that ""men have to take care of the women,"" thus creating the ""nice guy"" who feels entitled to women just because he'll be a ""protector"" and ""provider."""

i have said before that my grandmother told me when i was a young teenager that women like her, married in the 50s, stay at home moms of veterans, several children, left completely alone to manage children, the household, and war veterans with ptsd and alcoholism, were miserable. she told me to never be that for a man... that she had dreams and wanted a job and she never had that opportunity. she told me that they took a lot of dangerous barbiturates and amphetamines (!!!!!!!) just to get through  back in the day. these women were miserable living that life. they told us first hand. why in the  would i ever want to go back to hand holding grown men while they deplete my life force entirely for no reciprocal benefits. often times it's just abuse and soulless emptiness and massive loneliness and hopelessness. that's what happens to women when you make us focus entirely on taking care of everyone except ourselves. we managed to scrape together improvements and happiness from the bleakness.
don't tell me men can't do the same right now for themselves.
also, a side note...on facebook you can't say anything remotely negative about men without coding the word or using emojis or you risk a temporary ban. i got one for implying that i myself was a lowly idiot to make a point and i got facebook jail...for implying that i was a  idiot. i say this because on reddit where i can speak freely, i keep having to stop myself from erasing thoughts or coding them to avoid bans. facebook is  affecting so much .","it's not dense--for most of them it's very intentional. self-reflection hurts and deflecting blame is easier than holding themselves accountable.

i had a man message me and ask if i could look at a picture and honestly judge if his man  were too big. he threw in a whole back story about a girl laughing at him. i have no clue if this was real... it was very long and included multiple messages where he responded to my questions and he didn't send any photos when i told him to cease speaking to me. so it kinda felt like a real person. but like.... random dude..... i'm not your therapist!"

"yes, and what do you think is going to happen in therapy besides ""men, just stop?"" i've already offered other solutions and i can give you many more besides what you're saying which is, ""men, just go to therapy""","therapy is not a cure all for anything.
its not a cure all for drug addiction. its not a cure all for mental health. its not going to be a cure all for men that hate women for whatever motive they may have.
but it is the best we've got. therapy is also for a lot more than literal mental illness. ""men, just stop"" is never going to work. we have to make them.","it's coddling that we suggest them going to therapy is all they need when people have no idea the slightest amount of what actually happens in therapy. if you go in and say ""i'm lonely,"" well the therapist is going to just suggest you meetups and activities to go to, where the man can then harass women there with professional approval. the therapist will not figure this out until a couple years into it, because it takes time to dig through the surface at the inner issues. we could have been raising men differently this entire time instead of wasting time and resources on people who have no intent on becoming better and hardly see women as people.
for example, mass murders are an incel related problem. this is not cured by therapy. it's also multi faceted. men who feel entitled to womens bodies do not have a mental illness or any kind of emotional distress. they are simply frustrated that they can't demand  and have women fall at their feet.
suggesting therapy is also problematic because it suggests these men have a mental health issue. this is far from it. they are usually very privileged and live comfortable lives. they are fully capable of changing their mindset on their own, to stop watching misogynistic men on youtube, to stop laughing at  jokes, to stop blaming women for all of their problems. they choose not to.
inb4 ""therapy is for everyone"", no it's really not. if you go in there with no actual pressing issues, you will just stare at each other for 45 minutes. learned this the hard way.","not trying to makes leaps, i just really don't understand what you want. i don't think you actually want less men in therapy, that's just what it sounds like. ""men need to fix it"" is not an actionable solution so i can only base what i think you think the solution is on the fact you are claiming therapy to be a solution by women and therefore a bad option.
destigmatizing therapy is the societal solution.
therapy is not coddling, as you mention it is hard work and requires active effort to change yourself.","you're making a lot of leaps about what i'm saying. individual people going to therapy is great. but suggesting every man in current society enrolling in therapy will fix the problem is insane. it's clearly not a personal issue. and when you treat a societal issue like that, you make the societal solution women, again, in a different setting. i've been going to therapy for years. i know the kind of work they do. if you do not actually want to change, you won't change. it's hard work. its exhausting. i highly doubt these types of people are willing to put in the effort. stop coddling them.","so, your argument is therapy wont work?
therapy actually is ""them working it out themselves"". people go to therapy to work on themselves. going to a therapist isnt nonconsensual, male or female they can turn down any patient they want.
youre also making it out like these are convicted felons. these are guys who think they are lonely and want to figure out why. the therapist will tell them their want for a partner is a deflection from why they are actually unhappy. therapy ensues.","not what i was saying at all. but putting dangerous men in a close setting with women is a bad idea, and also just reinforces their belief that women are there as tools for them to use to feel better. the long term solution is that men stop feeling so  entitled to womens bodies and time. they need to get used to it. this stuff is not only caused by , the media, their fathers, but also encouraged and shared by men among each other. nothing women say will change their perception of women. they need to work it out themselves.","thats the short term solution but doesnt tackle the cause. we also need long term solutions.
your solution is like having soup kitchens but no effort to create affordable housing. sure, you're saving lives now, but youre really just surviving while maintaining the status quo.
and in no instance does anyone that knows anything about mental healthcare think the actions of a patient are the fault of the therapist."

"the early romans believed that a good woman was a woman who did nothing noteworthy, except to honor her male relatives and her family's lineage.
lucretia is held up as an example of a virtuous woman because she ""allowed"" a man to  her when he said he was going to  her and a male  in he bed as if he caught her in the act of adultery. she would rather be  than shame her husband by being accused of being adulterous. after the , she called her husband and father to her, ""confessed"" to being  (it was seen as the woman's fault, no matter what) and then killed herself to preserve her family's lineage and honor.
roman women didn't even have real names. each daughter was given the feminized version of her father's name. if there were more than one daughter, they would be named julia major (older daughter of julius) and julia minor (younger daughter of julia).",thanks for the rec! the aeneid thus far has treated the women characters as mere convenient plot devices. some truly  moments.,"after you finish the aeneid, you should read lavinia by ursula k. le guin. it takes a basically wordless woman in the aeneid who plays a key role as aeneas's wife and gives her a voice and agency and really beautifully fleshes out who lavinia was to the story.","i read song of achilles before circe, and it was, as you said, very helpful. and so good too! i'm reading the aeneid right now so i'm getting bits of the whole trojan war saga from all these different works. may i recommend stephen fry's great mythology series, beginning with mythos? listen to the audiobooks, if possible. fry has such a lovely enthusiastic way of telling the story.
i haven't read eleanor oliphant, but will look for it! i liked piranesi, but not sure i really ""got"" it.","if you havent read song of achilles yet, please do so. same author and style, and reading circe first gives you some between the lines character building of achilles' mother, which touches on the themes in this thread. so  good. (random shout outs to piranesi and eleanor oliphant is completely fine, just cause we're dumping good books we read this year).",circe was so good. and esme weatherwax knows what needs doing.,"your comment just flashed me back to one of the best books i read this year (and is in my favorites now), circe. anyone looking for a good book with this exact theme, look no further. other honorable mentions: wicked, anything with the witches by terry pratchett, and the woman warrior.
p.s. ill take recs too. :d be gentle tho, just read the bluest eye and it broke me a little.","spot on.
this is why the evil character in fairy tales are always older, more experienced women, i.e. women who can't fall into the cycle you mentioned because they now are aware of that ""virgin"" trap."
">i knew a woman who adored babies, but lost interest once they could speak.
that might be a woman who simply can't stand toddlers, i know they can be very difficult, but it also reeks of narcissistic mother to me - likes infants she can dress up like dolls and use as extensions of herself, but no longer likes the child once they're able to form and express preferences that might differ from hers.","thanks for doing that! there's so many cool subreddits out there; hopefully someone knows of some data.
i do love a good tangent. i could see communal childcare reducing the need to opt out of getting pregnant/having a child. if there's a community of women who love kids at different developmental stages, you could stay involved in a way that suits your temperament. (e.g. i knew a woman who adored babies, but lost interest once they could speak. not a great situation if you live in a nuclear family setup, but much less harmful to the kids if she had been living in a more traditional community).",i thought this was such a great question i asked it in r/askhistorians because google scholar and jstor didn't have good options despite using several different keyword combinations. i know a smidge about infertile women in bamanianga society but because having children was part of how you became an ancestor i can't conceive of a woman admitting openly to not wanting children. second wives were a not uncommon strategy if the couple was infertile but a lot of childcare was communal and the wives lived together away from the husband so i'd imagine there was high involvement even on the side of the infertile first wife. obviously super tangential to your question!,"i wanted to add that i find it interesting that there's not a lot of discussion about first nations women who didn't want to have children. there's discussion about infertile couples fostering or adopting children from kin, or the idea of children being raised by the whole community, but not about how a woman who didn't want kids was treated. it's possible they fell under the umbrella of what is sometimes called ""two-spirit"", but that's a really complex idea that i don't know enough about to even hazard a supposition.
anybody here know of any resources talking about women who were childless by choice?","is this related to how several religions have norms that basically say ""if you were a good person, you wouldn't be barren""? i know this is a cultural thing that probably predates the formalization of religion but christianity definitely has this line of thought, as do several west african traditional religions.","in myths,""childless"" is a symbolic shorthand for being warped and unnatural. to be a woman and not have (or want) children is a  against nature. medea's final act, the one that shows how inhuman she truly is isn't her killing her husband's new bride - it's murdering her children. in the story, that's what separates her from merely being a jealous woman and being a witch.","and almost always childless older women:
the wicked stepmother, the older childless queen, etc.","spot on.
this is why the evil character in fairy tales are always older, more experienced women, i.e. women who can't fall into the cycle you mentioned because they now are aware of that ""virgin"" trap."
"thank you
oh, tell me about it. somehow *we're* the problem","hugs if you want them.
women just can't win. have no children? you're damaged. have one child? you're damaging your kid (i got that one a lot). have more than one kid? geez, haven't you heard of birth control?","i'm one of those women that've never ever wanted children. i literally used to beg my parents not to have anymore kids after me (i'm the youngest of my siblings). it's disgustingly common for those of us who don't want kids to be told we'll change our minds, all women want children, no - you can't get sterilised because what if you meet the right person.
why is it that if a 16 year old girl accidentally gets knocked up and goes through with the pregnancy, no one bats an eye but a woman in her early 30s whose never wanted kids ""might change her mind""?
people outside of /r/childfree tend to think it's a toxic sub because sure, some people don't like kids but honestly there's a lot of support and we can all commiserate with each other about our frustrations of what it's like to be a person who genuinely does not want children. there's also advice for talking to your doctor about getting sterilised if that's something someone wants to do and a list of doctors who will do it without all the misogynistic ...
apologies for the rambling. this is clearly a very touchy subject for me","i wanted to add that i find it interesting that there's not a lot of discussion about first nations women who didn't want to have children. there's discussion about infertile couples fostering or adopting children from kin, or the idea of children being raised by the whole community, but not about how a woman who didn't want kids was treated. it's possible they fell under the umbrella of what is sometimes called ""two-spirit"", but that's a really complex idea that i don't know enough about to even hazard a supposition.
anybody here know of any resources talking about women who were childless by choice?","is this related to how several religions have norms that basically say ""if you were a good person, you wouldn't be barren""? i know this is a cultural thing that probably predates the formalization of religion but christianity definitely has this line of thought, as do several west african traditional religions.","in myths,""childless"" is a symbolic shorthand for being warped and unnatural. to be a woman and not have (or want) children is a  against nature. medea's final act, the one that shows how inhuman she truly is isn't her killing her husband's new bride - it's murdering her children. in the story, that's what separates her from merely being a jealous woman and being a witch.","and almost always childless older women:

agree to disagree for sure","you can set your own standards, that's fine. but in my experience, setting higher standards gets you a better, more considerate partner. so i will always advise women to leave if they aren't being considered. feel free to not follow that advice.","if i was in a relationship and someone got me a christmas present i didn't ask for or even allude to wanting and i showed appreciation, but didn't get them anything and then got broken up with immediately without discussion, i'd think that person was nuts.
i'd never do this, but if i *said* i'd get something for them and then didn't, i'd be more understanding if they wanted to end things immediately, but i'd still think an immediate break up without discussion would be a drastic move.
there are plenty of fish in the sea, and women have historically been taken for granted when it comes to hetero relationships, but what i see now is a lot of people over-correcting and just sifting through men until they find the perfect man that does the perfect things.. and i just think that's so silly because no one is perfect and if you expect your man to know all the ""rules"" of common courtesy and won't sacrifice a second of your time to discuss your expectations, you better be  perfect, too",no. i don't think you should ever have to ask for common courtesy. i refuse to ask people for basic consideration. there are better fish in the sea.,"yes, but there was a key thing you said there: ""keep asking for common courtesy"".. i personally am just waiting for op to say explicitly that she has had a conversation with her so.
she says this has been happening for two years and she said he said he doesn't celebrate valentine's day (but i wasn't under the impression that the topic of the gift giving empty promises is what led to him saying that.. i took it as them speaking generally about that particular holiday.. i could be wrong though of course) and then she said she's just not going to get him a gift anymore..
she never said she that in two years she's ever actually had a conversation with him about this thing that clearly bothers her.. maybe she did, but i don't like filling in contextual details in order to form an opinion.. i'm very curious to know what he's said when she really brings it up.. if she has..
people are going to walk all over you if you let them.. and if it turns out that op just kept expecting her so to spontaneously change without having a real conversation, i have no issue putting some of the blame on her for not standing up for herself.. hints and passive aggressive huffs and puffs doesn't translate (which i know is a huge assumption there - i'm just giving a generally example).. but yeah, if you're in a relationship for two years and don't feel comfortable being straight up and having a conversation or just otherwise letting something like this go on for two years without explicitly discussing what your expectations are, that's not completely on the so..
all that said, if it turns out op has in fact been continuously ""asking for common courtesy"", i'm 100% with you and the majority of the people in these comments..
and actually, i'm not even an advocate for second chances honestly.. setting a boundary one time should be enough.. if they care, they only need to hear it once and there are plenty of potential partners out there who ""only need to hear it once"".. i feel like a lot of people are taking what i say as ""be patient and lenient on men because they don't know better"" which is not my sentiment at all, but people are responding to me like that's what i'm saying.. i am literally just saying: ""step 1. say something""
am i assuming she hasn't said anything yet? more like, she didn't say she said anything so i am taking that as she didn't say anything.","i think the opposite - people take yellow flags and don't have the proper caution, and that's how they end up in relationships like the one op describes, where their partner fails to show up time and time again. i've dated too many people like that to even give them a chance - and then i ended up with a great guy who *doesn't* drop the ball. it's better to be selective than having to keep asking for common courtesy, imo.","i mean, i guess we're all just different, but if i were in this situation, it would clearly be an issue (if he wasn't giving presents, but i was), but it's no where near deal breaker territory for me.. especially if i haven't even had a conversation about it first.
i posted another long winded reply elsewhere, but i just think the yellow flags in a relationship are worth a conversation before jumping ship, because people just think differently and prioritize differently.. my sister once blew up at me for something i didn't see coming one bit.. it was just a blind spot for me.. off the record: i still don't quite understand why it was a big deal or how she even cared to put so much energy into being bothered about it, but guess what? i didn't say any of that stuff to her, because whatever her reasons, it clearly bothered her and i care about her and that was enough for me to care about this thing that bothered her and be more attentive to it.. i think the ""you can't change people"" is taken too literally and rigidly..
additionally.. the other side to this is determining.. hey, is this a yellow flag? or is it an incompatibility? if it were me, i'd be on the other side of this.. i *hate* giving/receiving gifts.. the only difference between me and this guy is that i would never say i'm gonna give someone a gift in the first place.. if he got me a gift, i'd say ""ohh you didn't have to do that! aw, thank you! i feel terrible i didn't get you anything"" and that'd be the end of it.. if that happened several more times, honestly, i'd be as uncomfortable as he felt slighted, like.. he'd think ""why isn't she getting the hint that she should be getting me gifts"" and i'd think ""why isn't he getting the hint that i don't do gifts"".. that'd be an indication of incompatibility.. then if we have to have a conversation, depending on how compatible we are in the other areas, if he really expressed that he'd appreciate more gifts, i'd absolutely give in without question.. but if he says ""oh, i was just doing it because i thought you were supposed to but if you really don't care about gifts, giving or receiving, then we don't have to do that"", that'd be even better
honestly, i only like giving gifts if i know the person is going to like it.. like if there is something i know he's been eyeing for a while and a special occasion is coming up, i'd definitely get it.. if a special occasion wasn't coming up, i'd just get it as soon as i could if it was something i could afford readily.. gifts for the sake of gifts straight up makes me nauseous and gives me anxiety, giving and receiving.. to have it deemed as ""who would want to be with a person who doesn't give gifts on special occasions"" - i take that personally.. and i just really don't think that's a hard rule the way a lot of people here are making it out to be","does she really want to date someone who doesn't take the time to think ""hey maybe i should find my gf a gift like i told her i would for this major holiday that many many people give gifts for and my gf gave me one two years in a row"". even if he's not malicious, he's dense and the opposite of thoughtful - how far does this extend into their relationship? deal breaker."

nothing in the health app is accessible through icloud, even though it's in the encrypted backup.","umm, by definition it is. it's ""icloud content"". for example, ios device backups would be mostly useless if they were only stored on the iphone and not in the cloud.",this data is never stored in the cloud. there is nothing to hand over.,"ehhh, sort of.

most of the time i never run into people again so i never know how things turned out. but at least two of those women did find me after and say it might have saved their lives. how is that not something worth doing, especially when all it costs are a few minutes on the phone?

no matter how loudly i screamed for help while trying to run away from him or talked about it with people practically begging for help, no one ever did. we even had roommates who knew and saw what was happening and would go in their room and lock the door rather than help or call the cops. only once out of 3 years did the cops ever get called and i found out the next day they went to the wrong place and didn't even follow up or try to find the true source.

you helped. not everyone does."
"i'm so sorry to hear another story like that, i have been so incredibly lucky to have such amazing support. as you said, it's so vital. my abuser was wealthy, which didn't help- he thought he could just buy an expensive lawyer. worked for awhile, against combined testimony and so much support it did eventually fail.

this is so important for an abuse victim but often gets overlooked. i knew a woman who escaped her abuser only to have some family member tell him where she was. he dragged her back. she thought he had the ability to find her wherever she went. (this was in the 80's so no apple tracking devices. )i tried to tell her that her  addicted husband doesn't have an inside with the government to track her down but she believed him because she couldn't accept that someone in her family betrayed her.
someone very close to me had their father-who they adored- tell them to go back with the abusive  because she had a child.","right. what happens is, the longer she's pretty much forced to stay with him, the less hope and mental ability she has to leave. despite what it looks like it is a form of brain washing.
when i was in a safe house a therapist or someone ( don't remember who she was, not a lot was registering at that point, i was just terrified ) gave a group talk. onus was how not to go back to an abuser.
asked her later "" how many go back?

"this still has nothing to do with what i said. stalking and obsessive exes are a major, massive issue, but one that is very difficult to deal with as laws aren't really designed to stop people who haven't broken significant laws. stalkers are an issue around the world because people who follow you and call your work, try to get you fired haven't broken any laws by doing so yet.
but again, that has nothing to do with anything i spoke about. leaving someone, leaving the house you live with your partner in and are in a relationship with is what i'm talking about. how you deal with an ex who won't leave you alone is a completely different situation. for one thing you have to leave said relationship and stop living them to be in the situation you're talking about.

eta: despite your dirty deleted you're still ignoring what i've said about laws that exist that aren't enforced. police and judiciary are the problem; they're protecting their rights to violence as they amplify perpetrator rights. silencing us won't make us go away. even when they  us there are always more survivors being denied.","> you clearly have no idea how abuse works. these women aren't staying by choice. abusers gaslight and brainwash their victims into thinking they have no other options.

my mom stopped slapping us and started throwing us against walls. neighbors made comments about how strict our household was.
she used to berate or pinch or slap. she started grabbing your hair and slamming heads against objects.
finally, she knocked my father down the basement steps and then went down and grabbed his head to smash it against the concrete floor. neighbors continued to laugh at my father. blaming him for the horrible abuse he constantly took. they would rather make jokes about his masculinity. they would rather watch this for decades.
i overheard gossip as they stood outside staring toward our house.
hoping one of the adults would know what to do. but all they ever did was ignore or mock our suffering.
calling the police on my own mother was so emotionally difficult. because the abuse teaches you to freeze or fawn to keep things peaceful. survival is protecting and coddling your abuser. if you can just be good enough, keep them happy and calm...well, if they get angry it's your fault. not theirs
living in abuse is a  up survival mentality
calling the police on her would be counter to survival. your whole body breaks down even considering such a betrayal. even if it's in defense of your siblings and father, the thing is their survival is also tied up in the abuser. your every instinct goes against protecting yourself.
i had to learn to discard wanting to survive. the hope for anything improving had to die entirely. and i was finally able to do something so traitorous as calling the police for help.
it was something i was only able to learn once i lost all trust in the community.
they knew. they did nothing.

"right. i have a friend who was dating a girl a while back, and i suspected that she was abusing him. i knew him several years before he dated her, and we worked at the same place.
she told me that he was crazy, and abusive, and that he once put a cigarette out on her arm. normally if anyone were to hear that you'd be alarmed for the woman. but this one was different. she told me this almost.... gleefully? and he was sitting there right next to her, not saying anything. as time passed, my friend was becoming increasingly sullen at work. she called him almost daily, accusing him of cheating on her. he would complain about her spending all of the money he had put in their joint account.
one day we all went out to eat somewhere and i think she said something i disagreed with, and logically explained why, which probably made her feel . after that day, my friend started making excuses as to why he couldn't hang out after work anymore. on top of that, there were some other mutual friends they had that saw him as an abuser so they stopped hanging out with him. she was isolating him.
one day she texted me saying to stop giving advice to him. she claimed it was because his dad wanted them to only follow the advice of the couple's counselor they were supposedly both seeing.
i ended up messaging his dad on facebook, and he was aware that she wasn't all that she was cracked up to be, and asked me to support his son, which i was going to do anyway.
eventually they broke up, but was still wanting her to take him back. he was eventually served a restraining order. i went to the courtroom with him, but he accepted ended up not fighting it, and accepted the restraining order, which was the best thing he could have done. because now he legally had to stay away from her (and vice versa).","i know what they wrote, but apparently people can't read what i wrote.
we do not know the motivations for those who do not interfere. maybe they are weak. or, maybe they were in the same situation as the victim just yesterday and are so triggered they freeze. perhaps they are scared. perhaps their own abuse has made them numb. perhaps they are assholes. who knows. but, to just lump them all together as ""weak"" is wrong - it is implying that someone needs to be perfect in these situations (and, i compared it to society's view of the perfect victim, too - one who leaves on the first offence and who behaves exactly as society expects - both are skewed views).
we need to focus our scorn on the *abusers*. not the victims. not the witnesses. they (the abusers) are the ones who are wrong here. when witnesses are called weak, we are blaming them for what happened, when it is the abuser who abused.","theyre saying its weak not to call the cops or at least think twice about helping, not weak to stay with your abuser",">weak.
i have called the cops many times. and, it did no good - the victim still stayed. this doesn't stop me from calling, even though i have always been afraid the abuser would figure out who called and come at me. that fear is legit.
i have also been in an abusive situation where i wouldn't have left (at the time) even if someone called the cops. i finally left on my own, but it took a lot for me to get there. would you call me weak because i didn't leave? because i was scared? i wouldn't call it weakness.
while i can understand why victims don't leave, i can also see why others don't get involved. it is just sad all around when everyone is blamed but the actual abuser.","yep. i've been in this situation many times and not one person (neighbor, family member, housemate) ever called the cops. only one or two ever even mentioned it to me privately.

"you can have a discussion around the ethical response to witnessing abuse while also holding abusers responsible.

you called people who didn't interfere weak. yet, you have no idea why they aren't interfering. they may have been like me and were triggered and couldn't call. they may have been in a position to not be able to call.
there are many reasons why someone doesn't step in. sometimes, it is because they are weak. sometimes, it is because they have other issues we do not know about. but, to paint them all with the same brush is wrong.

"you are so right. trying to help again and again only for the victim to choose to stay with the abuser is so demoralizing.
i have come to accept that intervention can only really work when the victim is ready to accept help and do the work required to fix the messed up psychological situation they find themselves in.","really? you admitted it yourself, you stayed right? so you were abused and stayed, how do your relationships change with everyone around you when they call the cops on you? yes i've experienced it myself but we've literally all seen it. you're admitting to having been in the same situation yourself, rather than walking away you stayed.
when 9 out of 10 times the person being abused choses to stay in teh relationship and get mad at the person who called the cops can you honestly not understand why people don't bother?","what a  cop out.
it sounds like you're upset about whatever situation you've been in before.","because ultimately, you stayed. people know how this goes. if people got abused and immediately left and that was normal then people would call the cops. you've said this happened many times so someone was abusing you and you stayed. so the likely outcome is someone close to you calls the cops, they come, and then you get angry at the person for interferring because after each of these incidents you stayed with this person.

"from what i remember reading, the police were most likely called but simply ignored the 911 calls until it was too late to save her. police ignoring reports is a problem that continues to this day. many people have called the police for burglaries and assaults, yet the police never show up then claim they were never called.
there was even a recent case of a serial killer being captured after one of his victims escaped. multiple people reported telling the police that women were going missing, yet the police never investigated because they claimed that there were no missing person reports made. turns out, the police had been refusing to take missing person reports this entire time.","okay. two claimed to have called police during the attack. but the police had 0 record of those.
one person called out ""let that girl alone"".
only one person actually went to her...
and i'm guessing the ones who thought it was a domestic, probably didn't see it... only heard... because she was white and he was black, and it was 1964. even for nyc, i think that would have been an odd coupling for that time... i don't think interracial couples were that common...","tldr lots of people did not try to help.
only 2 called police... after she was basically dead... after a 70yo woman was the first to find her.
about a dozen saw or heard some sort of physical altercation.","the kitty genovese case. which was recently debunked - lots of people in fact tried to help.

i just think of the infamous bystander case mentioned in psych... where a woman was beaten (iirc to death?) in an alleyway, and not a single neighbor called the police... though several heard and/or saw it happening... one did shout out from their window. which briefly scared the guy off.
any neighbor could have likely gone outside, or grabbed something to use as a weapon, and simply scared the guy off with their presence. but no one did.","... or trying. we can't individually make them stop, but yes, everyone must try to support others who need help. otherwise what is the point of us?","this. in my experience, most people don't call. don't interfere. most people are not good people. a good person would interfere if able, or at least call and ensure the police found the right place and were able to intervene.

"honestly, there's lots of articles out there with different information in each.
i highly doubt the podcast is likely to be the one sole source of information that's correct.... and even then, i doubt it would change my mind on the bystanders not doing enough.
as long as a few people knew there was a physical attack occurring, and none of them made any meaningful attempt to help... even check to make sure she got back inside safely. or keep calling the police until they got there.
then they didn't really do enough.","i would recommend listening to the you're wrong about podcast on kitty, as there are some wrong facts even in your current comment.","thanks for the link... i read up on it a bit more just now.
some people still saw her get stabbed, then stagger away out of view. none went outside to see if she was okay.
the people that saw the 2nd attack, after he returned to  and stab her more...
no one saw the full series of events. but about about a dozen people saw part of it.
two men were aware she was stabbed, one guy in the 1st attack. one guy was aware of the stabbing from the 2nd attack. but many more saw a woman getting beaten, some dismissed it as a ""lovers quarrel"". they didn't think a woman was being murdered, just another victim of domestic violence.
two of the 12 called police. only one person went outside, a 70yr old woman who held kitty as she died. after she was stabbed and .
i'm sorry but 2 people saw her get stabbed. one only called the police after she was basically dead, and the old lady found her and started shouting:
""intoxicated that night, ross heard noises and after deliberation, cracked open his door to investigate. he saw genovese laying on the ground, still alive and attempting to speak, and moseley stabbing her. he shut the door and called a friend to ask what to do. the friend said not to get involved.
ross eventually climbed out of his window and went to a neighbors apartment. he called the police after hearing sophie farrar call for someone to do so. ross' explanation--""i didn't want to get involved""--became the famous rejoinder of the bystander effect.""

"that's an interesting topic... thanks for the book recommendation, i might have to read it. there's definitely lots of bullying types in my workplace.
seems like it might the workplace version of a pdf i got on reddit : ""why does he do that"" by lundy bancroft. which focuses on abusive relationships iirc.
idk. a long time ago, in middle school... i found out another girl was being  by her father. i didn't tell a guidance counselor because i didn't want to make her situation worse. i've checked up on her facebook, and she seems to be well adjusted and living a happy life. but what if things turned poorly? she was always cutting her wrists (self harm, not suicidal)... what if she died? i probably would have regretted not speaking up. i'm glad she turned out okay. but i don't like to live with regrets, wondering if things would have turned out differently if i had just done something or said something.
i might regret it if i get seriously and permanently hurt trying to help someone. but i definitely will regret it if i provide 0 help. if that makes sense.","of course.
there's an interesting book, *nasty people and how to avoid being hurt by them.* (i think. it's been a while) it's more about manipulative workplace bully types, not physical abuse. but the lesson is the same - why do people say/do nasty things? one main reason is because they don't feel good about themselves, and they boost their own self-esteem by putting others down. for the physically abusive, this means inflicting hurt so they can feel that they are superior, because deep down they know or suspect they are less than others and can ""prove"" this is not so by being the physically dominant.","if they're gonna hurt a victim for someone trying to save them, they were going to hurt the victim anyways.
interfering doesn't change anything when you have someone violent who is looking for an excuse to abuse.
ie. the abuser will say ""i'm only doing this because you tried to escape"". but if they didn't try to escape? then the abuser will say ""i'm only doing this because you didn't wash the dishes"".
it's like how a cheater will always cheat... an abuser will always abuse. they just make up excuses and find anything wrong so they can try to explain their behavior. when deep down it's just that they're  up.","very good points.
except - nowadays, a bully knows the power of a phone and will see any move to call, record, or whatever as a provocative move. and, they are unpredictable. stand well back, be ready to run.
i'm an average height, slightly(?) overweight guy - but i haven't been in a serious fight since grade school. i seriously doubt i could take on some guy who has a habit of physical violence and a berserker attitude where they could be aggressive without regard to themselves getting hurt. i don't want to find out the hard way, because if i lose the victim- if they don't want to leave - is no better off than when i started. most likely worse, now the guy is angrier. ""see what trouble you brough onto me!!??""","calling 911 takes less than a minute, assuming you know where you are. (and you should always know where you are tbh, pay attention to street names and businesses nearby... or look for a nearby house #).
then hit record on your phone. to get video of the person and what they look like. what they're doing.
telling them you called the police and are recording them will often get some to stop without a physical altercation.
it can be a bit more obvious if they're on drugs or ... in that case just keep your distance.
it shouldn't be too hard to outrun a  if you're in even half decent shape.
i'm a petite woman who weighs just over 100lbs. doesn't mean i would just run and hope the police or someone else did something. if i get hurt. then i get hurt. but at least i wasn't a coward who stood by and didn't even try to help someone being actively hurt.
granted, physically interfering depends case by case. if you see a stranger attacking someone for no reason (ie a random street attack or something), then take into account, can you and the victim handle the stranger? are there any makeshift weapons you can use nearby?
domestics are a bit different. because the victim has to be the one to want to leave. and if they aren't ready to leave their abuser, they'll likely attack you or get mad at you for interfering. and let's be real, there are very few cases where a woman is being locked in a house and 100% unable to physically leave. they usually stay out of a misguided sense of love. and repeatedly willingly go back home to their abuser.","the problem is... what are you going to do? the aggressor is likely , and obviously acting irrationally. unless you're the type who can definitely win a no-hold-barred bar fight, the moment you get involved you put yourself at risk.
calling the police is obviously the best idea. however, you are dealing with an irrational violent person. if you even open your door or knock on theirs to tell him off, and then the police show up, he may simply blame the person who told him off. just call the police and let them handle it.","this. in my experience, most people don't call. don't interfere. most people are not good people. a good person would interfere if able, or at least call and ensure the police found the right place and were able to intervene.

men don't have to deal with the frequency, ubiquity, or severity of  assault so most chose to pretend it doesn't happen. lots of women like to prescribe traits to victims in an attempt to distance themselves from bad things.
this is one of those things that many people, men and women, will try to invalidate your feelings on. they will try to make it seem less severe because they want it to be. but it doesn't change reality and you need to listen to yourself better and not let others' convince you it isn't a serious issue.

a woman is an adult. a girl is a child. it's pretty straightforward. there are actually adjectives to differentiate age if that's relevant (it often isn't). if you're skittish about calling a 22-year-old a woman, i think that's a you problem.",of course you can. though they do denote an age also. the better terms to use when appropriate would still be male and female.,so men and women aren't words you can use?,"i'm honestly not sure and i've been shocked to hear it. i use male and female, i deal with adults. you really shouldn't be using boys and girls outside of casual company, both have been used to demean and insult. male and female are the proper terms and should be used where appropriate."

yes, nexplanon is a type of hormonal birth control. it contains the active drug etonogestrel, which belongs to a drug class called progestins. progestins are synthetic hormones that act as progesterone (a type of hormone found in your body). this hormone helps prevent pregnancy.",luckily i have to get it removed soon. like next week. i'm thinking of switching to the arm implant because i'm horribly allergic to bc pills,"dude if you have an iud, that's what was causing ongoing bv/utis for me, and mine was implanted into my . seriously find one stat if you've been having iud problems. those things are the devil. i had the copper one and it was truly horrendous. as soon as the doc yanked it out i had zero problems with bv/uti since, and it's been years.

"thank you for this. it's very easy to say ""no sane person would do something like that"", but these guys don't behave like someone who's (medically) delusional. they're angry, filled with hate, lacking respect and remorse, and convinced that their reasons are justifiable, but they know it's  and do not care.","yep. logically, extreme violence is an indicator that the perpetrator **is not** mentally ill, so they should be handled with a level of wariness that **exceeds** that used around people who are genuinely mentally ill.
the violent perpetrator has the greater capacity to assess, plan, mislead, and enact violence - a true and ongoing threat to anyone who gets close enough.
people are unsettled by the perception of unpredictability in a mentally ill person, but perceived threat does not translate to actual threat. the average person wants to think that a sane person (as they think they themselves are) is not capable of such brutality. spolier: some humans just .
thinking mental illness = threat is a bias i wish everyone would examine within themselves. the world could be a kinder place if we did.","thank you!

"i remember watching a true crime doc about a teenage girl who lured a 12yo girl into her car and took her out to this place in the woods and brutally tortured her before killing her. and unsurprisingly it turned out her parents had done some truly horrifying things to her throughout her short life. it made me so sad that the teenage girl, though she was the one who actually did the horrible acts to the other girl, was to be punished for the rest of her life because of what her parents had done to her. it disturbed me that her parents wouldn't even get punished for what they did either. our society is all about pointing the finger and calling it justice and then we're shocked that horrible things keep happening. i think people have a hard time understanding that trying to help, to rehabilitate, to prevent, to teach, etc. is not the same as excusing horrible actions.
i'm very sorry about your uncle.","people are so supportive of trauma victims--until they admit to committing some heinous crime during a trauma response, that is. once victim becomes victimizer we call them depraved monsters. my dad used to say your empathy isn't worth much if you can only empathize with people you understand, and i think that applies here. i really don't think anyone *set outs* to become a sociopath.
i'll never forget my mom telling me about my kind and mind-mannered uncle coming back from vietnam asa very young man and maniacally running down a dog in the road. he later said he couldn't clearly recall the incident, and was really disturbed by it happening. he also experienced what everyone called ""extreme fits of jealousy"" when he later married the love of his life, a widow to a young man who died in vietnam, whose photos he would violently smash while hyperventilating. it seemed clear to me that there was a  of a lot more to it than just ""jealousy"".
i've been in relationships with people who were badly abused as children and have seen a couple different versions of trauma responses. when that  hits, i really don't think people have control. they become strangers to me, but also to themselves. these were people whose abuse ended by elementary school yet it clearly affected them deeply. even with a therapist, with family support and a very motivated individual, it is really, really hard to undo that damage. and most people aren't getting any of that.
i'm fairly sure there are statistics on this and the fact is that a significant portion of violent offenders in prison have experienced significant trauma. you can absolutely  basic human development, like self-regulation and empathy, with the right combo of trauma and lack of support.
eta: and i honestly don't know why people act like suggesting there could be some reason humans seem more capable of heinous violence in some geographic regions vs others is ""letting people off"", but i suspect it had something to do with the ""justice=punishment"" mindset that puts dangerous people in concrete boxes with each other so they can become even more poorly-suited due release into society.","i don't want to argue with you because i've got the whole gamut of mental illness myself, but it is very very common for abusers to have been abused themselves. they are often mentally ill. well-adjusted people do not abuse others. and pointing out the mental damage that using violence as punishment for children causes can help teach folks to stop doing stuff like that. in general i don't think acknowledging the mental health of violent and abusive people is meant to demonize everyone with mental illness as violent, it's more so acknowledging that being violent is not normal and it often occurs because of abuse by caregivers.","thank you!

"they do get information on what the total charges were and how much you are disputing as well. so yes, they can figure it out if they keep good enough records and are willing to spend the time to go through their records.
it really depends on how much information you gave the vendor. it also kind of depends on how many of these credit care disputes they get.","thank you for responding!
can the company not cross-reference the disputed amount with the charges in their customer database?
based on their responses to the google reviews, i wouldn't be surprised if they retaliated out of petty spite.","my parents owned a small business, and as a result i got a chance to read over and respond to the disputes. the merchants don't get information like your name, address, phone number or anything. of your credit card number, the middle 8 digits are x'ed out. they get to see the reasons why you are disputing the charge and some basic instructions on how the merchant can respond with their side of the story. if they don't respond, you win by default (provided the dispute resolution agent can fit your complaints into a valid category).
there is a risk of retaliation, but it somewhat depends on what information you gave them already. if you didn't leave your name or address, then there's almost no chance of it happening.
of the credit card disputes i've been involved in (which admittedly isn't much), there hasn't been any retaliation.
further, from a merchant's perspective, it kind of doesn't make sense to retaliate. the money's gone. retaliation won't bring back the disputed charges, can result in more bad reviews, and can land them in trouble with the law. it isn't worth it for a business owner. and the employees certainly aren't going to care enough to retaliate.",my only concern is that once my cc does the chargeback they'll know my identity and may attempt to retaliate against me.,i've gone this route myself and then helped friends and family resolve disputes as well a handful of times. the credit card dispute resolution is very consumer friendly.,thank you for your advice. i'm more seriously considering this route now.,"they won't i promise. they just mention you were scammed and they'll guide you through the steps to get it refunded. i wouldn't trust this company if they make people sign ndas and hire  makeup artists.
like teen girls can do makeup and hair better than whatever laughable people they have there? i saw the reviews with some edited pictures - wow are so so bad. the skin smoothing is soo obvious and kinda fake looking. i wonder if all their business is through prizes

:( but also thank you for having a conscience!,"haha, i would hope to able to name every tactic, i paid thousands of dollars to be taught that ""system"". i just never had the heart to actually implement it, which is when i realized i will never be really wealthy.","holy , you identified every single thing they did! no joke, that is insane and incredibly evil. i'm actually shocked right now that you were able to name every single tactic and strategy they used from beginning to end. i'm very impressed.","if they post their prices, it allows you to price-shop. there is literally more than one training package (i paid to do one) where they teach this. it's called ips (in person selling, super creative /s) and relies on holding your images hostage, together with every single dodgy sales technique to pressure you into buying a package.
i'll wager they used reciprocality ( i gave you a shoot, you owe me one), the sunk cost fallacy (well you've already spent the time/effort, and you wouldn't want to lose that, right?). not to mention going through each and every image, taking over an hour, and wearing you down until you would give them your money simply to get out of there.
it's a ""sales system"", and it's evil.","it definitely felt like the owner (who is male) set this up to purposefully be disingenuous. also, why don't they post the prices on their website? how is that so hard to do?","i genuinely feel bad for you. photographers like this ruin the industry, for both the customer and other photographers. and yes, the fake claim of ""female empowerment"" is particularly grating as this was a male photographer exploiting a power dynamic to rip you off.","i think if only one or two aspects had been bad, i would've been able to look beyond that and still enjoy myself and the end results. but to have so many things leave a terrible taste in my mouth, end up with photos i absolutely dislike, and to come out of it feeling so bad about myself because they didn't listen to me at all, is literally the opposite of what they were claiming their photoshoots were all about (which was women's empowerment). yes, way to empower me by not listening to me at all.","me and my wife tried running a boudoir studio for a while, but quit because we couldn't stay afloat without these predatory business practices, such as the ""free "" shoot that is anything but.
sorry to hear about your bad experiences, but from the business side at least, this is par for the course.
the mua/pinterest complaints are very valid though. if they want to charge premium prices ( which they do) then they have to provide a premium experience.
we still do it for fun, and if you were in new zealand i'd offer to do a shoot for you, but you may have success going on to photography groups and looking for people who do it for the love of the game, instead of just as a paycheck. that opens up a slew of other issues (like pervs posing as photographers) so i do feel compassion for women who simply want good shots at a decent price."

women message men at a rate that's on a pretty realistic bell curve, even though they're not ""rating"" them as highly. it's men who only reach out to the ""hottest"" women.

but most guys are just being lazy. maybe it's 30% fear, 70% laziness. and it can turn into this angry 'take me as i am' kind of attitude. one that extends to the rest of their life. chances are they don't exactly take much time to clean their house. or themselves. and honestly, even when i was younger and stupider, i didn't have time for that .","i was kind of wondering if there was an intentional effort to try to appear not to ""care too much"", but the last time i commented about this on reddit i was unironically yelled at about how unreasonable it is to expect a man to get a nice pic, outdoors, in decent clothes.

i'm just not sure the best way to approach this."
"our purpose in life is to raise our bar and others bars higher, to set the standard for the next generation.","but real life spaces are attributing toxic masculinity to men as a whole group???
aswell, there has been modelling for the last few years suggesting this trend will continue. and less men and women will pair off (society collapsing event).
in 20 years when there arent enough people, nor money to look after the elderly, you will see how humanities morality changes.","that's if you accept that it exists in reality.
i concede that the data pertains to dating apps and there, the pareto split would obviously exist purely dint of the male to female population being so overwhelming male.
but the split is being incorrectly applied to real life spaces and toxic masculinity is ascribing toxic feminity traits to women as a whole group.","so if toxic masculinity influences male dating strategies, and toxic fenininity influences female dating strategies.
then we might have a sociological reason for that 80/20 pareto split in the dating world.","off the top of my head, toxic feminity is expecting men to have no feelings. to never shed a tear or be sad.
expecting men to perform sexually at the drop of a hat. shaming men for  inadequacy.
expecting men to pay for them and give them money.
causing arguments and expecting men to defend them.
manipulation and playing mind games. abuse.
pretty much anything you'd find in female dating strategies.","you have to remember. for most of history, the reason we partnered off is that it was incredibly difficult. before the first industrial revolution, it was both mum and dad raising the kids and looking after the farm, the kids were working from the time they could be productive.
we live in the most privledged time in history. the advent of birth control has given women freedoms they could never have imagined a generation before. women often didn't want the right to vote as it came with a responsibility to enlist.
the issue with modern society is we want freedom without responsibility.
there is a large focus on toxic masculinity in the public discourse. could i ask, what do you think is toxic femininity? and how does it play into our culture?","i get your point but those roles weren't taken away, they became superfluous.
when women were able to vote, work, own property and generally have rights, they no longer had to rely on men just to survive in society.
over the last 70 years, the classic role of man providing for and protecting his family has become outdated but we're still preparing men for this role.
thus there is a huge dichotomy between what men are told they should be versus what women require of them.
it's this dichotomy, coupled with toxic masculinity and a general insecurity which causes men to question their place in society. and why they want women to roll back the clock to an earlier time when the roles men were groomed for are relevant.","it's not about data though, it's about a large subset of men who are trying to find meaning. the roles and jobs which gave their forfathers meaning have been taken away, and the family unit, the thing men would stoicly endure suffering for, is a dying phenomenon.
we need to move away from us vs them (groups), towards the original us vs them, family."
"aswell, we are discussing a natural phenomenon called hypergamie. where women typically want men who are higher in wealth and age. and men typically want women who earn less than them and are younger.
the advent of online dating had increased the perceived potential candidates for women. instead of perhaps 100 guys in the local area, they can go on social media and find the attention of millions, and head to dating apps being selective (3% yes) and still matching with 20 guys a day. men and women are two parts of the whole. like ying and yang, they arent equal in outcome, they're equal in that they each have the necessary attributes to complete the whole.","that's if you accept that it exists in reality.
i concede that the data pertains to dating apps and there, the pareto split would obviously exist purely dint of the male to female population being so overwhelming male.
but the split is being incorrectly applied to real life spaces and toxic masculinity is ascribing toxic feminity traits to women as a whole group.","so if toxic masculinity influences male dating strategies, and toxic fenininity influences female dating strategies.
then we might have a sociological reason for that 80/20 pareto split in the dating world.","off the top of my head, toxic feminity is expecting men to have no feelings. to never shed a tear or be sad.
expecting men to perform sexually at the drop of a hat. shaming men for  inadequacy.
expecting men to pay for them and give them money.
causing arguments and expecting men to defend them.
manipulation and playing mind games. abuse.
pretty much anything you'd find in female dating strategies.","you have to remember. for most of history, the reason we partnered off is that it was incredibly difficult. before the first industrial revolution, it was both mum and dad raising the kids and looking after the farm, the kids were working from the time they could be productive.
we live in the most privledged time in history. the advent of birth control has given women freedoms they could never have imagined a generation before. women often didn't want the right to vote as it came with a responsibility to enlist.
the issue with modern society is we want freedom without responsibility.
there is a large focus on toxic masculinity in the public discourse. could i ask, what do you think is toxic femininity? and how does it play into our culture?","i get your point but those roles weren't taken away, they became superfluous.
when women were able to vote, work, own property and generally have rights, they no longer had to rely on men just to survive in society.
over the last 70 years, the classic role of man providing for and protecting his family has become outdated but we're still preparing men for this role.
thus there is a huge dichotomy between what men are told they should be versus what women require of them.
it's this dichotomy, coupled with toxic masculinity and a general insecurity which causes men to question their place in society. and why they want women to roll back the clock to an earlier time when the roles men were groomed for are relevant.","it's not about data though, it's about a large subset of men who are trying to find meaning. the roles and jobs which gave their forfathers meaning have been taken away, and the family unit, the thing men would stoicly endure suffering for, is a dying phenomenon.
we need to move away from us vs them (groups), towards the original us vs them, family.","that this data is clearly not true: there are many men and women in relationships, thus for it to be true, you have to ignore the fact that people are obviously dating.
that they need to go out into the world and actually go into spaces where women and men co-exist to see it for yourself.
that women are not a hivemind and you have to treat them as the individuals they are.
i could go on but most of it boils down to ""get off the dating apps, go outside and actually talk to real people."""

you're describing his politics in relation to your own, but your politics do not equal political reality. the vast majority of americans hold views that are to the right of bernie, therefore he's on the radical left of the american political spectrum. i'm a radical leftist as well. we shouldn't be scared of that label.","not leftists. your label was accurate. but we've let right wing extremism hijack political language. what is realistically politically center is called extreme left by theocratic fascists, and now everyone is just going with it. sanders is not a leftist. he's not even truly ""liberal."" he wants capitalism, but just with some social safety nets. he wants common sense social policies, which are pretty politically neutral. we have to stop letting fascists dictate our language. although i do think just as it pertains to dating apps, yeah it's better just not to put your political affiliation, because the terms you use won't accurately describe what you believe. and if you use accurate terms, they'll be interpreted using the now shifted fascist language."
"*sigh* i was born in england and keep up with politics there, but have lived in the us for many years.
pretty  to bring up somebody's nationality to try to discredit their politics, though. hope you're happy with yourself for that.","um sir you're from england and telling me what is and isn't radical left in my home country??? sanders is not radical left, even by american standards. trust me, i've worked with true american leftists. as far as mainstream politics, he's more left, but it's still disingenuous to call him leftist because *again* we shouldn't be ascribing to fascist definitions of what is and isn't the left in the us.
also apologies for misreading your statement about him being on the left of the american political spectrum. but it's still not the whole truth to call him a radical leftist, and entirely disingenuous. like lol","ummm... that commenter was me...
and i explicitly mentioned that i was talking about the us multiple times.
 read. ffs.","you didn't say the far left of american politics, nor were we talking within the american range of left/right. as the commenter before you mentioned, the overton window has shifted so far to the right in the us and leftists have been assassinated in droves so a proper leftist force does not exist in american politics. sanders is, at most, a liberal. he's center-left, not far left. he's a capitalist for god's sake.
as u/latvia mentioned, stop letting right wing political extremism highjack political language.","how? out of 100 senators he's probably what? the 99th or 100th furthest left?

"love how you can speak for all men and putting down ""women like me"" for having reasonable standards and trying to fear monger me for the time i get older. what are you projecting onto me?
there's a multitude of reasons for men or women being single or not. ever thought that more older women are single by choice because they prefer it that way because the relationship before wasn't working anymore and men stay in the relationship because it benefits them more emotionally?
there are multiple variables playing into this. women also tend to live longer than men, among the single women over 65 are most likely also quite a lot of widows. how does the percentage of single people say anything about their desirability anyway? there are people who are desirable, but who are still single. some people just get into relationships out of fear of being alone or for stability.
i don't even actively date at my current age, so if i were a guy, my life would pretty much be the same because i don't date either way. or at least i'm not actively looking.
i've seen so many socalled average joes having girlfriends and being generally quite successful with dating. and no, they're not the top 10% of men, they're your everyday guy from next door that don't really stand out from the mass, but they found someone that matches them.
it's usually the ones being insecure or having poor social skills who might have a depressing experience with dating, men or women. or they just had bad luck.
all i said was that you shouldn't depend your happiness on a relationship and this applies to every  and you're coming with statistics to proove that women become less desirable among the broad mass, even though no one was talking about this.
my point still stands regardless.
it's far more complicated than ""young women are too picky because they're still pretty and have more options until they get older"". numbers are not telling the whole story.","what exactly implies that i think too high of myself? because i said that i enjoy my own company and don't let myself pressure into a relationship? please.
also since when is online dating reflective of the real world? tinder works much differently than meeting someone in the real world and most people only use tinder for hookups anyway.
it could be that women's desirability on online dating declines more after a certain age compared to men's desirability, but why would i care? i don't use online dating anyway and when i'm older, i don't want anything to do with men in their midlife crisis who look for women the same age as their daughter or niece.
like if less men are into me when i'm older, it doesn't matter because it only takes one person to click with for a relationship. quality over quantity.","girl even in online dating it's show women have much much steeper decline in desirability compared to men their age .that women when they are in their 40s men start becoming more desirable than them in dating(if you want to me to link the studies i can do it.they are reliable they have 200k big  sample size)
this literally online dating the platform that women 90% the power in dating.
i actually think older women are extremely attractive i don't believe this incel rehotic that women age badly .
but ask in guy in their 30s and tell them how dating was in their early 20s and they probably will have ptsd from how young women pickinees.
. i agree with all your statements and i don't side you friend but you seem to think too high of your self because you think you're independent women who enjoy her time alone. but let's be serious try being average joe in his 20s and let's see how you respond to loneliness and singleness.
tldr: i agree with you in everything in this post but i still think you're pretentious young beautiful woman who say that she enjoy being single and say ""singleness isn't bad"" because she has power in dating over men because she is attractive young women.
that why i'm telling you get old and let's see how you respond to singleness when men start being picky.","don't even try the old ""hitting the wall in your 30s"" line like women turn into  hags the day they turn 35, that's bs.
men have their right to be picky as much as i do and if they don't want me, they don't want me. if i don't want them, i don't want them, simple as that. there will always be people willing to date, no matter at what age and if an older guy only wants to date younger women, so be it. you say yourself they're apparently , so why would i want to be with them then? if a man in his mid 30s has unrealistic expectations, that's not a man, that's a manchild.
i like cats btw.",">is he physically attractive?
eh, he looks alright, average, i'd say, but not my type at all.
>is he trying to be your ""nice guy""?
i hope not, and i don't have a bf.
>how's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' pov? where is him empathy?
he is able to understand others' pov, but when it comes to this topic, he has tunnel vision, unfortunately. usually, he is kind, takes care of his friends, is considerate towards everyone. it's not as black and white and it seems like once the topic of being alone is mentioned, his inner demons come out. i understand your sentiment though and appreciate your empathy with me! i'll set much stronger boundaries with him for sure.","how's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' pov? where is him empathy? is he physically attractive? he literally treats half of the population as subhuman. is he trying to be your ""nice guy""? do you have a bf? once you have a bf, he probably will be mad at you, disappear and talk smack behind you.","oof you read him like an open book
he is pretty much looking for someone doing the emotional labor. during the conversation, i felt like he was dumping all his sorrow onto me and i could just try to shield it off of me, without any consideration of how it makes me feel when i try to encourage him and he just keeps wallowing in self pity.
i mean i don't think he's deliberately trying to manipulate, but more or less subconsciously. but i think you're right, i had a similar talk with him this summer and what triggered it was that while we were talking about the topic of dating and whether love at first sight is a thing or not, i said that attraction at first sight is definitely a thing and that i do pay attention to the way a guy looks and the way he carries himself.
meaning i want to be physically attracted. i didn't mean i want my man to look like some sort of model, just someone who i find cute in his own imperfect way. of course personality is important, but i do need that attraction, the chemistry. not that much of a revolutionary concept, isn't it? lol to him it apparently is.
it could very well be that this completely normal statement made him mad because it showed him that women care about more than the bare minimum and are not as desperate as him. just like with my best friend ""emily"" from the post, just hearing that a woman is also able to be happy without a man made him bitter enough to react like that.
coming to think of it, he is talking a lot about financial topics and his plans in that regard and is always talking endlessly about the details of a certain topic that could have been compressed into one or two sentences (to a point where no one is even really listening anymore because no one cares that much) and to lowkey try to impress people with his intelligence.
the thing is, apart from that he's a good guy, but he has a  ton of issues he needs to unpack, but he doesn't realize that. otherwise he's fun to be around but whenever that topic comes up, it's exhausting. i feel kinda torn because i don't want to ditch him as a person completely, but if he keeps getting on my nerves like that, i have to ask myself if i want to keep hanging out with a guy like that or have an honest talk with him. because dating wise, i'd never entertain a guy like him either.","he sounds like a typical low emotional intelligence guy to me. instead of working and self reflecting he just continues the denial and it snowballs into inceldom.
men like this are desperate because they're relying on their partner to fulfill a lot of their needs. self acceptance, stability.. sometimes even entertainment. so not having a partner is just him bouncing to one side of the room to the other because he can't work on his own self acceptance or entertain himself properly. he desperately doesn't want to be ""alone"" because he dumps basic human needs on women. it's like walking around with a huge basket of dirty clothes and crying that you need it washed asap (only by a woman) because you never bothered to learn how to do it yourself.
these guys also love to strategize relationships because they don't see the other gender as an equal. it's always a red flag when someone is ok with potentially ""manipulating"" their way into having and maintaining a relationship. like pick up artist culture.
of course he is not going to like women having their own standards and wanting to be with attractive men.. that means he can't control or manipulate them into dating him. they use money/income, social status, ""intelligence"" as date baits and it's pathetic.
i don't think it's worth the time and effort to deal with these guys anymore, seriously. they're tricky and insecure enough to try to bring you down with them."
