0,Thank you.  :),I will aspire to keep my pink hair and acquire more pink things in her honor!,"Awee, thanks so much!  She passed a long time ago.  We did everything together.  I recently purchased some pink bathroom tissue and thought of her.  :)","She sounds amazing, my apologies for her loss. I would love to have pink everything!","Oh my!  My grandmother was the same way with bright red lipstick 💄!  She colored her hair red and wore a lipstick color named ""Stop Red.""  She would never be seen or photographed without either.   I miss my grandmother so much.   She liked the color pink too.  She had pink everything, even facial tissue and bathroom tissue!","My grandma doesn't care about much makeup, but she keeps her bright red lipstick by the bed. She puts it on first thing, before she even leaves the bedroom.

I'm pretty sure she doesn't use a mirror because it's just a smear, no shaping or anything. She says she can't start her day without her war paint 😂","Same! I never loved having to wear makeup but once the pandemic forced us all to work from home and anytime I'd go out I had to wear a mask, I stopped putting it on and just never started back up again. Also shifted to more of an interest in skin care which has been great!

I grew up with a mother who wouldn't let me out of the house as a teenager if I wasn't wearing makeup. I had bad acne that I wanted to cover up and my mom grew up in the southern USA where being ""presentable"" was absolutely crucial to your social status. So I have always had a weird relationship with makeup. Even now in my late 20s, if I mention to my parents that I have an important zoom meeting or event they'll ask if I'm going to put makeup on for it. Like, no? This is my face, it doesn't matter how important the event is it's not going to change the face I present to people. 

It's been so freeing to reach this place with my self confidence!","For me, it was Covid. I have to wear a mask constantly at work (hospital) and have had to do so for the past 2.5 years, so wearing makeup didn't make any sense. It only ended  up on the inside of my mask, and it was too expensive for that. Eventually all my makeup expired and I found that I didn't really want to buy new. I am very interested in skincare, though, so my hobby just shifted a bit. 

Like you, I'm enjoying my newfound freedom of just walking out the door with a bare face if I feel like it.

(And no, I'm not one of those people with naturally beautiful skin. I have a mustache that I have to shave every morning, I have oily skin, and dark circles under my eyes. But it doesn't bother me anymore, and I've never gotten a bad comment, even from people who knew me ""before"")"
1,"That's what I'm trying to say, about Mexico. People trying to congratulate Mexico for having a ""left"" wing party, when 95% of that ruling party is made of people that were part of the oppressive party that ruled Mexico for 75 years.

And all that just because they legalized abortion, wich it was going to be legalized anyways whichever party was in power, as protests and strikes kinda work in Mexico.

Again, the goverment of Mexico didn't legalize abortion. The activists, and the hundreds of thousands of protesters did.","Doesn't sound like he's very far left. Sometimes people are shitty at identifying politics, and ""Economic nationalism"" sounds to me like a very right wing position.","Exactly, the current president it's far left and he passed the law.","> Like a couple months ago the Mexican federal government passed a law to cut regulations on food production.

That's right wing in any context.","I meant US left wing its not the same as Mexico left wing. For example the religious, uneducated poor that votes against their own interests vote MAGA in the US, and vote Left in Mexico. Like a couple months ago the Mexican federal government passed a law to cut regulations on food production.

BTW I'm not talking about Brazil, they/we needed Lula to win against that extremist. And to save the amazon.",Yo what the hell does this mean???? Poor countries don't deserve left wing governments???,">While also aligning themselves with catholicism and the military.

And cartels. 

I'm far left in the US, as America it's a rich country that can afford social-democratic policies for the benefit of the poorest and POC.

But Mexico needs a Right, center-right goverment and their economic and judicial policies, or even a real leftist.

As OP said the progressive policies passed didn't have to do anything with the current government and not political party would dare to struck them down or fight them as they are the will of the people.","I wouldn't be so optimistic. At least in Mexico, the government it's left-wing only on paper. It's more like a centrist-populist. With some left leaning policies. While also aligning themselves with catholicism and the military. In other words, it's complicated. Most of the advancement in human rights have happened thanks to the hard work of activists and through the courts. The government only following through after the fact."
2,I doubted myself for a bit too. I enjoyed the conversation too so not futile. Have a good'un.,"I’m really sorry! I watched this video previously, and despite going back and seeing this warning, I somehow completely missed it that it was YouTube’s doing. I thought that you were referring to trigger warnings that this creator uses, without actually understanding you. 

This argument has been futile and my fault! :(","I was reading it as the video had been slapped with these warnings by YouTube, who were basically saying that the content may be false and may mislead the viewer in some way that would have a negative impact on society.

It may be that these content warnings were in fact general trigger warnings that were added by the creator with positive intent.

If it is the latter I retract my previous criticisms, but looking at it again it does seem to be something YouTube has added to ward people away as if the video is going to e.g. incite hatred or violence.

You then get into the query of is this similar to censorship or is it more similar to a general age rating as you might see for all movies.","I think you’re wrong about content warning being about information, but I’m not 100% sure what it is. Here are two options:

1. Content warnings means that the medium features content that may be triggering, such as Abuse, Murder, Substance use. Trigger warning is about the discussion of such, without necessarily featuring content. For example, I could have triggered a classmate while talking about abortion, without actually featuring pictures, videos, recordings, written experience of abortion. I should put a trigger warning. If I do have any of these, i should’ve used a content warning for abortion. 

2. Content warning is about a medium featuring content that elicits strong negative emotions, such as abuse, murder, substance use. Trigger warning is about a medium featuring content that might elicit a traumatic response in someone. If my discussion includes depiction of excessively harsh criticism, and a classmate has traumatic responses from experiencing excessively harsh criticism, I should have a trigger warning, but not a content warning. I should have a content warning if I depict or mention something that will make most people very uncomfortable. Think Gordon Ramsey calling a cook stupid and him freezing/crying because of childhood trauma

So when a video contains hate-speech, a content warning would mean “this video will contain depiction of hatespeech and not just mention it” or “I think that most if not all of my audience find the hate speech that I will depict as disturbing, instead of eliciting a traumatic response in only a small part of the audience”","Yeh. So this video seemed to have one that basically said ""be careful with the information in this video, it may be false"". That is absolutely ridiculous.

The ones that say ""this video touches on topics that may trigger xyz"" are a good thing.",Aah. I think I got you now,"Regarding content warnings: More or less I have no idea, but different ones. The ones calling out hatred (like this one) really shouldn't have content warnings, and there are far too many genuinely hateful ones that don't have warnings but should.

Trigger warnings are a different thing, and are absolutely fine and more videos should have them.",Are you saying “more videos should have tw” or not?
3,That is gold,"GETTIN' JIGGLY WITH IT, NAH NAH NAH NAH NANAH NAH NAH...","It is now. Thank you for the contribution. 

COMMENCE THE JIGGLY.",I didn't realise my typo until you quoted me just now and that makes it sound even more horrifyingly hilarious hahah. Like it's the name of some dick-wiggle dance.,">Do you jiggly your dick on her clit violently in the same manner that a clit-stim toy does? 


this image is both HILARIOUS and horrifying","Hahah, this is so insane! You're not wrong in that he's got the mindset of a teenager. The fact that he's insecure about the size of a toy designed for external stimulation is just so ridiculous to me. In what way would they compare, Adam?! Do you jiggly your dick on her clit violently in the same manner that a clit-stim toy does?  

OP, you have EVERY RIGHT to be mad and your response thus far is completely normal and justified. He's the one being a little bitch about everything. The fact that he views you as a living fleshlight during sex is so horrendously disrespectful.",I just bought the wand a couple of weeks ago and tried it on a couple of times when I was alone. I used it for the first time when the two of us were together a few days ago. I think he noticed that the wand is way bigger than his penis and so he got nervous.,">He then angrily asked me if my climaxing was just as important as his, and I replied by saying yes,

This question alone shows that he doesn't consider you sexual equals. He clearly doesn't consider you climaxing to be as important as him climaxing.

>He was initially fine with me using the bullet in bed earlier. A few days ago, I began using the wand and he just stopped and looked at me with a confused stare. I

Did something happen a few days ago or have you never used the wand in bed before? I don't understand why he would suddenly go from accepting your need to have clitoral stimulation to not accepting it."
4,"And why does he insist on living at his mothers house, if her actions bother him?","He eats her head off too. He can go weeks without speaking to her. He ignores her on the daily. It’s like we live there with her but not all that present. We do our own little things. His lack of a healthy relationship with his mom affected me in the past because I wondered if he would refuse to build a connection with my mom because of it. It’s super important in my family that we’re all close and happy and spend time together. He isn’t treated like a “son-in-law”, he’s treated like my parents own kid. The love and respect he receives at my place is not to be found at his.","What does your husband say when your MIL says racist things about you? This makes my blood boil. If any of my family members or friends said racist things about my SO, heads would roll.","I love him and I want this to work on the long run. But it deeply hurts that I don’t know how to be the bubbly person I once was. And now my grandma is deteriorating but the one person I want to go with me, refuses just the idea of traveling to my country. Fuck. 

I know all the answers lead to I’m unhappy. AND I AM but fuck I just want to be happy with him again. I want to live life with him. I want to do things with him. I can always do it solo but I want to WITH him, and that’s my downfall. 

I know I’m being frustrating because the answers ARE THERE but I can’t help but want things my husband doesn’t. 

I’m just feeling a lot and needed a safe place to let it out. I’m so sad.","Honey you literally just said several paragraphs about why it’s not just about travel.  

It’s not.  His unwillingness to travel a symptom of his larger attitude towards you, your culture and your race.  


There’s nothing wrong with YOU.","I think it is. But I also wish he’d spend more time with my family. Like actually learning them and being present in their lives. 

I try to build a bond with his mom all the time. She’s super mean to me when he’s at work and I’m home. I usually have to spend my free time outdoors to avoid her. I only tell him a few things at a time because I know his relationship is already so bad with his mom. 

I try not to make it worse but I’m living in hell with him just so I could be near him. 

I feel like I’m dying in order to be loved. My family means EVERYTHING to me; yet I left my comfy home to spend our marriage at his place. 

Why can’t he come and stay with my family while saving for money? It’s not like we had a traditional marriage. I stay with my family almost every other weekend. If I can handle his moms racism, why can’t he handle my family? We’re just a bit loud and have more fun at home. 

It’s the little things that have become big because I don’t see him trying for my family but I try everyday to be accepted by his mom. 

I have to hear about my dark complexion, what I can wear or not wear because “bright colors don’t look good on dark skin and dark colors also don’t look good on dark skin” 

I’m considered white in my south Asian community. I’m considered almost sickenly pale. Yet I’m getting told on the daily that I shouldn’t wear this or that. 

I try so hard to be accepted when he isn’t home. Or when he is home. I’ve just recently stopped trying because NOW when I look in the mirror, I see myself as dark and now I have an issue with it too. 

I’ve never been a colorist in 27 years of my life. Now when I lay on his chest, I’ll tell him “wow, I’ve really gotten dark” 

Fuck, it makes me cry just recalling this from the other day. Like I actually told my husband “my arm did get dark huh” 

Why have I become so disgusting.","Bare minimum doesn’t sound “great” to me. 

The problem isn’t about just the travel, is it?","In other ways.. everyday things are pretty nice. He makes sure we get to have our date nights, he’s more emotionally present and physically present when he isn’t working and home. He spends more time with me, he tries to meet my physical needs. I acknowledge all the little things he’s done for me. 

It’s just.. it’s bare minimum.. so I’m left feeling like the things I ask for more—aren’t being met. 

I’m sure he’s probably feeling discredited and misunderstood. I’m sure he has complaints about me too; but I just feel like I’m so giving and out there and I wish he’d meet me halfway."
5,"Damn, guess I need to follow some local food trucks. I need this in my life. Woefully out of the loop always.","Oh yes.  We have a Hawaiian shaved ice truck that we'd never be able to find if it wasn't for them sharing their location.  We've also found many local events because of them.  Like they'd post ""We'll be over at this event today"" and we're like, there's an event today?  Well let's check it out.","Also for all people like to bitch about social media in general, its fabulous for local businesses. I LOVE being gently reminded about my favorite local restaurants' weekly specials. Or sales, or street fairs or open studio days.","This is how I use Twitter, very curated.  Very narrowly focused on artists and cosplayers.","Honestly, I love TikTok. I keep it very curated and I get videos of people weaving interesting baskets, neat cooking tricks, this one woman who repairs loved stuffed animals, permaculture and botany stuff, an interesting guy who rants about pedestrian infrastructure failures, drag queen makeup videos. All of these sites can be horrible. Curate it for what you actually want and block what you don’t.","Eh, I'm 19 and most of my friends - even those older than me - love that app. I can't stand it...one video turns into ten then a hundred and soon enough, your whole day is gone to mindless short clips by people who don't know what they're talking about

Edit: word change","tbh I never understood the appeal of TikTok at all, but I'm probably just too old for it","I deleted Twitter and TikTok. They've been cesspools for ignorance, hate, and misinformation."
6,"That’s why twitter calls it “deactivation”, not “deletion”. Deactivating your account will not be subject to the 14 days GDPR law because it’s not technically “deleting” your account. 

In order for Twitter to actually remove all of your data from its databases you have to (a) be a citizen requesting from an EU country and (b) actually ask their customer support to delete everything. 

Source: I help manage global user data for a cloud company and have to do things differently for EU customers.","The law applies both internationally and to private companies. If twitter doesn't pledge to be deleting all user data when an account is requested to be deleted within I believe it's 14 days then it is not legal for them to operate in any EU territory and they can face a fine worth I think it's like 10% of their yearly earnings plus whatever other damages the EU court decides. 

Twitter can still be accessed from Europe so I'm fairly confident they are following this law.","not everyone, including Twitter itself, is in the EU. Also, now that it's a private company, they might just decide to keep all that data for themselves whether you delete it or not.",If you delete a tweet it's still backed up for 14 days so that changes nothing. Just deactivate the account. EU law mandates that all personal data is deleted within a certain amount of time after account deletion.,"This is not true. You have to delete all your tweets otherwise your data is still there. There are 3rd party bots that do it for you because the only way to delete tweets is individually.  Basically, you have to give the bot your login and password and it goes and runs the script. I learned this after I deleted my 15 year old account when Musk announced his intention to buy. Gotta nuke it completely otherwise he still gets your data whether you use the site or not.",Deactivating is deleting,"Hijacking top comment to ask: how do I delete my account? 

I never use Twitter but I made an account a long time ago and DEFINITELY want to delete it. Someone please give specific directions (for mobile users) because it’s NOT obvious how to do it. When I went to “help- account support” it gave me the run around. Eventually it mentioned “deactivating” the account, but I’m not sure if that’s the same as deleting it.","Nah I did this same thing a few days ago aswell. Had a friend make a tweet that literally just said ""pedophilia is bad"" and she got ratioed 5 times despite the original tweet having 100 likes from people trying to justify pedophilia. If musk doesn't actually do something that site is dead."
7,CBD was a game changer for me. It relaxes and all but as someone who gets high with one muscle relaxer it doesn’t do much except help with the pain,Or some nice edibles if that's what you're into,"And if you are headed for bedtime, a shot (2 oz) of booze is a great muscle relaxant, which is what’s needed.

17,Lmao nice,I'm the same. I had an IV removed and they had a cotton ball on and a bandaid over it. I walked out of the hospital and everyone was looking at me.

Preferred Knicknames, options on physicality, clear boundaries for them ( and you) with an understanding of things that need to happen (like dr apps). And lots of validating."
19,I didn’t say that everything is solved. There’s a bigger picture I am looking at here. What are you going to communicate to your daughter about domestic labor (or communicate to young women in general)? That she should just accept it or that it’s worth pushing back on and not something she is required to do just because she’s a girl?,">more households where the woman is the breadwinner

But if covid showed up anything, it's that women are still doing the ""second shift"" when they get home, and still hitting the glass ceiling at work.

We'll agree to disagree here.","I think it does, because it means a lot more kids and young people are questioning the gender binary, which means they are open to questioning what it even means to be male or female which has largely been a social construct, which is kind of wonderful. I didn’t even know what gender non binary was until a friend (previously female identifying) came out as they/them to me a few years ago. I think it does help cis women, because it directly challenges what the patriarchy is holding up about gender norms, and basically is an f you to this system. It’s brave for people to come out as non binary, and it’s the first time gender as a social construct has entered the mainstream, and it does help us.

Yes, there is still sexism, but besides gender fluidity there are things that are changing. There’s more women who are college educated, more households where the woman is the breadwinner (https://www.americanprogress.org/article/breadwinning-mothers-critical-familys-economic-security/), more kids with openly gay parents which, more people coming out as trans and non binary (which you may or may not know about a kid for years), more people seeking treatment for their mental health, more women living their lives on their own and on their own terms. There are more movies and shows directed by women, and this has been awesome because we consume media. Yes, there are still bad things. My point, is it’s also good to acknowledge the positive changes, because the more we celebrate these changes the more positive impact we have on the world. If we only focus on what is worse, then what does this tell young women? It takes away their power in the world. It’s awful Roe was overturned, but there are still more of us that support roe it than not. If we want to push back and keep moving forward, we have to acknowledge the progress and continue to push progress. Otherwise, we are giving up, and yes, we could lose more rights. But, it’s not inevitable if we focus on how we want to shape the world and realize there are many like minded people, who are perhaps, the majority.","Okay, I'll give you that. But I don't really think that the fluidity of transgendered or binary youth really has much impact on cis-girls. Cis-girls and women don't suffer any less sexism than they did before. For them, things are very much the same, and sometimes, a bit worse.","I would say, for one thing, that are understanding of gender is changing, and this is the big, relevant change of what it even means to be a girl or boy in society. They/them is very common and accepted with young people and even kids, and kids are pretty willing to challenge gender norms in ways that didn’t exist before. There’s much more fluidity around gender than there used to be. 

I would also say there’s more acceptance and awareness of mental health and diverging from being neurotypical. So a lot of young people I have worked with are very good at talking about their struggles. This doesn’t mean they’d not have struggles, but it’s not stuffed down like it was a a generation or so ago. This has been my experience working with gen z. I also have a teenage stepson. The most popular kid in my stepson’s middle school was a girl that came out as gender non binary went by they/them and had cool style. It had nothing to do with looks. This is a big change, and would have been unheard of in the 90s or early 2000s. Gender non binary did not exist. 

I’m not saying it’s all better. We don’t live in a utopia or equal society. That being said, I am saying our understanding and attitudes towards gender are changing, especially among young people who, frankly, are leading the way on this, and that absolutely has an impact on how kids are expressing themselves. With parents who are supportive, usually, it’s good and positive.","How are things truly different for girls?

Sure, body and fat shaming is less prevalent, but it still happens. I wasn't pressured to send nude pictures to boys when I was growing up though, and I didn't have to contend with boys watching porn the way they do now in lieu of a sex education. Rampant sexism was going on when I was growing up, but music gave women a lot of power, and the freedom to be exactly what they wanted to be. Remember the Lilith Faire? There was a certain message about the 90's that I don't really see much today: *It's wonderful to be a woman. Celebrate your womanhood.*

I honestly can't really see how things are better today than they were then. I will say that teachers and parents are less tolerant of that shit than they were when I was growing up, but that's because it's *we* who have changed, not really kids.

I guess it all depends on what constitutes a good role model.....but I didn't say there weren't any, I just said there were few. And I really do believe that.","I don’t disagree there are problems for girls. I’m pointing out that there’s been changes, and things are different. That doesn’t negate any issues. I just think it’s worth considering what progress there has been, and that kids are a bit different than when we grew up (assuming you are a millennial). I definitely don’t think all issues have been solved for girls. That would be nuts.

I disagree there aren’t role models though.","Uh, I totally disagree with you. If I'm so wrong about it all, then why do so many young girls have such poor self esteem and still think they need to be beautiful? That is not something that I'm projecting. It's very real and very much a concern of the time. 

If anything, growing up when I did was actually better for some girls, because we at least had the whole ""girl power"" thing going on. These days role models are scant and few."
20,"Not heated at all, and the psychiatrist I gathered earlier.  Good luck and be well","i appreciate it as well! while self esteem *can* be indicative of how successful someone will be in life it's actually one of the more shaky ways to determine their success. personality theorists see incongruence between who one is and who one wants to be as a more solid indicator for distress and other similar issues in life. This is where i really think gender roles can hurt people, like you said with your point on nature vs nurture and how they could be passed down by parents. A child who's raised to be a girl that doesn't want to be a ""girl"" (in the context of feminine stereotypes) would probably show a greater incongruence between who she is/pressured by her family to be rather than who she wants to be and that's where you'd see more insecurities or, on the other side, more acting out. (Acting out is seen more with authoritarian or negligent parents) 

It's also definately frustrating to see it take it's toll on others you know.

Though self esteem can be built back up, you're right that it's incredibly difficult to climb out of those types of thinking. With therapy and psychiatry, many times it's not an option that many people can afford or just would be too embarrassed about attending due to how stigmatized it is. There's an incredibly large multitude of factors at play with situations like this and it really depends on the specific situations that lead to seeking out abusive partners, knowingly or otherwise. 

If any of this comes off as heated i assure you I don't mean for it to, i just got out of classes so I'm a little fried, also if you want me to clarify anything please ask, I'm studying to be a psychiatrist and love talking about personality theory and child development/psychology","“Loser magnets” are the ladies who say “why do I always go out with losers” as you saw it wasn’t an insult. I also agree that a woman who’s never been in that type of relationship ends up with that personality trait. It’s either a family member talking down to (or at) her or radiating off a parent who’s witnessed it in their parent, I don’t know exactly. I will say it’s way to common and until there’s some way to teach self-esteem it won’t get better, unfortunately. But how, I think that comes from your own successes, win at sports get more confidence playing, same with exams at school, but I hated to see it in some of my daughters friends. I appreciate the dialogue","I'd say you're right that self esteem plays into it, i see it as the result of a self fulfilling prophecy wherein the women who you so hilariously put as 'loser magnets' are that way because they believe they can't do any better. what interests me is what causes women who're neurotypical and haven't gone through trauma/psychological programming by an abuser, to develop that sense of themselves and when it takes form. Gender norms seem very pervasive with younger girls, which reminds me of this really great video essay I watched about the book titled 'the care and keeping of you' and how that book used to perpetuate ideas about dressing modestly and that it's not okay to discuss puberty and going through it (for girls of course.) 

All this to say that i think you hit the nail on the head and that I believe part of that insecurity for women who hadn't already had it programmed into them is caused by how heavily parents or caregivers adhere to gender roles.

 I think the idea of the ought self and the actual self also definately go hand in hand with this but i digress- I'd be happy to try (to the best of my half completed psych degree) to explain those a little more, it's really interesting stuff!","Thank you, your thoughts if you don't mind.","This is an interesting comment, I'm just commenting as a bookmark to see how the discussion goes when more people reply!","Interesting you say that and here’s a theory of mine.  I’ve always said the most attractive trait any woman can have is self-esteem or self-confidence. Most real men are not afraid of a successful, intelligent woman but they are attracted to them where insecure “men” or I’ll say abusive guys avoid them. A woman with little to no self-esteem in fact are loser magnets (is that too harsh?). In that situation the guy sees a woman who won’t question him, when asked “where do you want to go eat?” will say wherever you want is fine, what movie “whatever you want to see” etc. which for that guy is great until it’s not. At some point that does get old and that’s when he changes and isn’t nice any longer, now it’s “can’t you make a choice?” “Why am I always deciding, can’t you make an F’in decision?” etc. and it gets worse from there, I believe that’s why so often it’s “he was so nice when we started dating then he changed….”.  So a confident woman attract confident men.  Any replies either agree or disagree?",It really is. What you’ll find though is men do exist who value strong women. And the reality is those guys still were formed within and live in a culture that is misogynistic AF so they won’t always get it right - but when you call them on their shit they’ll listen and learn.

Republican candidates continue to spread rumors about voter fraud in attempts to delegitamize any candidates they don't agree with, while conservative state legislatures try to make voting more difficult.

You were specifically talking about violence against **AFAB** people

>to women (and enbies) who are **AFAB**

I said that it isn't because someone is AFAB vs AMAB

>I think it's less of an AMAB vs AFAB thing
 
You were the one pitting AFAB vs AMAB (a line of distinction that I, as a non-binary person myself, hate). You were the one who in response to a trans* person turned around and said that AFAB people have it worse. It's no different than those men who turn around and bring up how bad male suicide statistics are, but only in response to people commiserating about misogyny. Which is especially egregious when statistics show that ""women who are AFAB"" don't actually experience violence ""more so"" than trans people (once again, including non-binary people such as OP) of **either** AGAB.

Look, I'm going to stop replying here. All you're doing is flipping an uno reverse card and going ""no u"" on the bits that I'm calling out.

EDIT: and I've been blocked","um, the post also says that OP *now understands what women experience* in terms of harassment and violence.

This is a lot more complicated than you think it is, and actually unpicking the nuances and challenging some of the assumptions here is a necessary and important thing to do. Shutting down discussion and trying to make people compete with each other in the way you are attempting to push for is incredibly unhealthy. Literally nothing in my comments is anything but supportive of the OP, and it’s possible to be supportive *alongside* engaging in a wider discourse. You do not have an absolute right to set the terms of discussion here.

Further you posted a link talking about violence against women, and yes, compared to men women are much more likely to be a victim of violence. However, OP is not a man, nor were the groups addressed in the comment you replied to (with the exception of femboys, but them being men is secondary to the point being made).

Yes, I do think if men did the majority of the domestic and emotional labor, then it would very much be viewed differently. What a silly question. Of course it would. Everything that gets pushed off on women is devalued and given less importance in the heterosexual relationship ""exchange.""","If I'm understanding correctly, in your opinion it's essentially less about the degree or salary itself and more about the assumed contributions to the relationship based on past experience and statistical averages?

Of course wealthier men are 100% better for some women.,"100% of that ""small minority of european men"" has preformed better than 100% of american men I've been with. And it's none of your business, but the sample size is enough to make me confident in my findings.",">Most of them dont have that whole ""you're my first (insert race here) girl I've been with"" thing that seems to be so common amongst men in the states.

You can't generalize based of a small minority of European men you've been with"
29,"I am a black woman. Why would I lie about being a black woman?  I think you’re a troll, why else respond the way you did?  Not sure what exactly I said that offended you. 

I’m honestly having a very hard time dating. I’ve seen white man after white man pick white women at church to date and marry. They’ve never picked me. After 5 years I finally figured out that they don’t want black women. I got all my dates from online dating 5 years ago and even that was hard because I was still being filtered out. Something changed during Covid 19 because I haven’t gotten a date in 2 years. Dating in the Midwest is extremely hard for black women.

Dating apps have shown that black women get the least swipes. There is data on this that you can look up if you are interested.","I’m 100% for interracial relationships. I’ve only dated white men. I agree the problem is other races as well but when you look at other races, most other races mainly date their own race. If most black men dated black women then there wouldn’t be a huge gap in black women not getting married.","Babe, black guys can have their white girls. It is what it is, but the problem isn't black men don't want to date black women. No man wants to date us period. And what makes you think we just long be in such homogeneous relationships? Everyone else can be in interracial relationships, but not us? We have to stick to our race to be happy and fulfilled? Yeah, I don't think so.","Only 30% of black women get married. The main problem is most black men don’t want to date black women. They want to date white women. If all white women stopped dating black men then black men would be forced to change. 70% of black women never get married, that’s a big problem.

Black men are fetishizing white women. Why would white women choose to play into that?

You don’t sound like an ally to black women. How can women stick together when we refuse to support each other?","""You are taking black men away from us""

Wtf am I reading?","Knowing most black men date white women then dating black men. Yes, you are playing into it. You are taking black men away from us. If all white women stood up for black women then this wouldn’t be a problem. Black men will never learn if white women keep dating them.","If a guy said to me ""I don't date Black women because they are Black women"", I wouldn't date him. But if he never brings it up, and otherwise acts normal, and never makes any racist comments, how am I supposed to know? That doesn't mean I'm ""playing into it"".","I agree. I’m black, through research I’ve discovered only 30% of black women get married. It’s because of the racism. Most black men don’t want black women, they want white or anyone besides black women. White men only want white or any other race than black women. All other races go for the same. The Midwest sucks for dating. I’m filtered out of dating apps because the men only want white women. White women play into it because they date these racist men. 

Religion is also a problem. Racism is a lot higher amongst white Christians than the non religious.

I’m planning to move south next year, I hear dating is a lot better down there."
30,You're welcome--hugs and best of luck to you.❤️,"Oh thank you. It's not anywhere near what my grandmother went through. It's not physical or constant. I do see the best in people. 🙂 it's just hard sometimes. I wish I would have really heard what she was trying to say about men. She was trying to tell me they were very much not all safe.

Men....do they do anything like this??? 

I want to be treated like a human being. Not a.... trauma dump. We have our own feelings and needs and most every woman I know is putting in massive effort. 

I have said before that my grandmother told me when I was a young teenager that women like her, married in the 50s, stay at home moms of veterans, several children, left completely alone to manage children, the household, and war veterans with PTSD and alcoholism, were miserable. She told me to never be that for a man... that she had dreams and wanted a job and she never had that opportunity. She told me that they took a lot of dangerous barbiturates and amphetamines (!!!!!!!) just to get through shit back in the day. These women were miserable living that life. They told us first hand.

Also, a side note...on Facebook you can't say anything remotely negative about men without coding the word or using emojis or you risk a temporary ban.

33,"Sure, and others need a harsh reminder that women are not a means to a end, but ends in themselves. 

&nbsp; 



Gentle suggestions for therapy and philosophy will not reach men who threaten violence because they aren’t getting compliments or their dicks sucked. I’m out of fucks to give for woman-hating, slut-shaming miners of manosphere hate.  Their quality of life *might* improve with therapy, but if they want a partner, they will have to actually respect and regard women as fully autonomous humans with the same natural rights to happiness and freedom *they* enjoy. There are no shortcuts to romantic or social success, and impotent rage towards women is a prison of their own design.","Thats actually the point. Thats the part of men that needs to change. They need to stop seeking validation from women and that needs to come from how they're raised and their environment, therapy for those who deviate.

Edit: to clarify, it doesn't always need to be positive reinforcement. Their environment can change in a way that is hostile to unwelcome behaviour. But if we are talking about changing the most people we can for the better as possible then both the carrot and stick should exist.","Well put, but so long as that benchmark requires the use of another’s body, I feel comfortable demoting desire for female validation.","Its the male equivalent of a woman's value being tied to her desirability and ""purity""(yack).

Its obviously not the only thing. But society demanding multiple things doesn't undermine any individual one. Its just whichever benchmark you dont meet is what you're supposed to feel like shit over.","> Its not innacurate to say that patriarchal norms train men to act this way.

It’s inaccurate to claim that men’s entire identity and mental health is wrapped up in their reputation with women. 


Anyone from any culture can easily lay down a quick list of what traits make a man. Strength, competence, respect of their peers, courage, independence; confidence. But romantic success is their supposed sticking point? 

&nbsp; 


Nah. Prowess does do not define a man; prowess is what a man *wants*. Men are now claiming that romantic success is how masculinity is defined because it lends urgency to a made-up problem.","Its not innacurate to say that patriarchal norms train men to act this way.

Where they go wrong is thinking it actually excuses behaviour and they dont need to change. They do need to change.

Poverty causes robberies but doesnt make it okay to do. People with minority characteristics will automatically be at disadvantage even though it is unacceptable. Society will often cause ails that manifest in the actions of individuals. Short term solutions are needed to address the individual while long term solutions address society. In this instance it'd be the destigmatizing and accesibility of mental healthcare.","Women know this, but men counter with the claim that “society” has trained men to believe that sexual validation from women is the measure of a man’s value. 

&nbsp; 

Sounds good, except it’s blatant bullshit. Society has no knowledge of the individual man’s sex life. The individual *wants* sexual gratification and frames it as though sex and female validation are essential to life, placing the burden of their mental health on women.","The cure for mens loneliness is not women, its mental health care.

Just like the cure for addiction isnt drugs, its mental health care."
34,"Therapy is not a cure all for anything.

Its not a cure all for drug addiction. Its not a cure all for mental health. Its not going to be a cure all for men that hate women for whatever motive they may have. 

But it is the best we've got. Therapy is also for a lot more than literal mental illness. ""Men, Just stop"" is never going to work. We have to make them.","it’s coddling that we suggest them going to therapy is all they need when people have no idea the slightest amount of what actually happens in therapy. if you go in and say “i’m lonely,” well the therapist is going to just suggest you meetups and activities to go to, where the man can then harass women there with professional approval. the therapist will not figure this out until a couple years into it, because it takes time to dig through the surface at the inner issues. we could have been raising men differently this entire time instead of wasting time and resources on people who have no intent on becoming better and hardly see women as people. 

for example, mass murders are an incel related problem. this is not cured by therapy. it’s also multi faceted. men who feel entitled to womens bodies do not have a mental illness or any kind of emotional distress. they are simply frustrated that they can’t demand sex and have women fall at their feet.

suggesting therapy is also problematic because it suggests these men have a mental health issue. this is far from it. they are usually very privileged and live comfortable lives. they are fully capable of changing their mindset on their own, to stop watching misogynistic men on youtube, to stop laughing at rape jokes, to stop blaming women for all of their problems. they choose not to.

inb4 “therapy is for everyone”, no it’s really not. if you go in there with no actual pressing issues, you will just stare at each other for 45 minutes. learned this the hard way.","Not trying to makes leaps, I just really don't understand what you want. I don't think you actually want less men in therapy, that's just what it sounds like. ""Men need to fix it"" is not an actionable solution so I can only base what I think you think the solution is on the fact you are claiming therapy to be a solution by women and therefore a bad option.

Destigmatizing therapy IS the societal solution.

Therapy is not coddling, as you mention it is hard work and requires active effort to change yourself.","you’re making a lot of leaps about what i’m saying. individual people going to therapy is great. but suggesting every man in current society enrolling in therapy will fix the problem is insane. it’s clearly not a personal issue. and when you treat a societal issue like that, you make the societal solution women, again, in a different setting. i’ve been going to therapy for years. i know the kind of work they do. if you do not actually want to change, you won’t change. it’s hard work. its exhausting. i highly doubt these types of people are willing to put in the effort. stop coddling them.","So, your argument is therapy wont work?

Therapy actually is ""them working it out themselves"". People go to therapy to work on themselves. Going to a therapist isnt nonconsensual, male or female they can turn down any patient they want. 

Youre also making it out like these are convicted felons. These are guys who think they are lonely and want to figure out why. The therapist will tell them their want for a partner is a deflection from why they are actually unhappy. Therapy ensues.","not what i was saying at all. but putting dangerous men in a close setting with women is a bad idea, and also just reinforces their belief that women are there as tools for them to use to feel better. the long term solution is that men stop feeling so goddamn entitled to womens bodies and time. they need to get used to it. this stuff is not only caused by porn, the media, their fathers, but also encouraged and shared by men among each other. nothing women say will change their perception of women. they need to work it out themselves.","Thats the short term solution but doesnt tackle the cause. We also need long term solutions.

Your solution is like having soup kitchens but no effort to create affordable housing. Sure, you're saving lives now, but youre really just surviving while maintaining the status quo. 

And in no instance does anyone that knows anything about mental healthcare think the actions of a patient are the fault of the therapist.","mental health care just shifts the responsibility onto (mostly female) therapists. if you’ve read lundy bancroft’s why does he do that, it talks a lot about how therapy only makes abusive men more dangerous. instead of enabling and coddling these men, we need to focus on keeping women safe and independent away from these entitled predators."
35,"Whataboutism is not a good argument. Especially when you're on reddit, which is also doing the same shit.

You know why I talked about Twitter? Because this thread is about Twitter, not 4chan.","Ok if you don't want to talk about *should* and talk about what *is* happening, why even waste time talking about Twitter when 4chan is the website that actually creates and publishes the shit radicalizing people? That's the reality. Being angry over Twitter doesn't change anything. If everyone leaves Twitter it will become just like Tumblr, a hollow shell of it's former userbase, or vine and just shut down, all the while 4chan is the one still producing white supremacist propaganda to feed 13 and 14 year old boys.

There is not a solution here where anything productive comes from dialogue about specifically Twitter.","It doesn't matter what people *should* do, it matters what is happening. Shouting ""they shouldn't have gotten their news from Twitter"" after they shot up a grocery store or bombed a planned parenthood accomplishes nothing.","Generally speaking Twitter has never been a place for reliable news, its just PR as a social media for celebrities and politicians, and for normal people it's just goofing off, porn, and or arguing with people over misinformation",Radicalized people are going to continue to get their news from wherever meets their agenda,Using Twitter as your source of news is the millennial equivalent of boomers using Facebook to get their news,"If only ""just stop using Twitter"" prevented all the issues. Musk is buddy buddy with Putin and about to control a social media platform that MANY people rely on for updates and news. Prepare for more radicalization.

Hopefully he goes through with his stupid blockchain idea so he kills the platform sooner rather than later.",Just stop using twitter. People get way too addicted to that garbage anyway. It's like the McDonalds of internet.
36,"nowhere did you imply that formula is okay. this whole time you've been implying that it's not. if you read my last reply, you'll see that i said breast milk is better. but formula is fine and you don't get to shame people into breastfeeding. THAT'S my argument.","You're harming people, I'm educating.

Formula is OK, breast is best.","Slogans aren't reality, please stop harming people.","fed is best. it's none of your business how people decide to feed their baby. until i saw this post, i never knew people considered formula a problem. yall will never be satisfied.","> and by the way, if you think a woman has to breastfeed her baby, sorry to say, but thats kind of rapey. ""how dare you not let your baby suck on your tits😡"" leave people alone.

This is absurd.  You cannot invite a baby into the world then decide to treat it like shit.  I mean, you can, but that's insanity.","baby formula is required to meet federal nutrient requirements, meaning babies are still getting nutrients. i was formula fed after a few months. news flash, im fine. you aren't going to be able to look at a group of 10 people and pick out who was and wasn't breastfed. 

and by the way, if you think a woman *has* to breastfeed her baby, sorry to say, but thats kind of rapey. ""how dare you not let your baby suck on your tits😡"" leave people alone.",No.  Please don't spread misinformation.,she doesn't have to breastfeed if she doesn't want to. baby formula is a perfectly safe alternative.

38,"The early Romans believed that a good woman was a woman who did nothing noteworthy, except to honor her male relatives and her family’s lineage.

Lucretia is held up as an example of a virtuous woman because she “allowed” a man to rape her when he said he was going to kill her and a male slave in he bed as if he caught her in the act of adultery. She would rather be raped than shame her husband by being accused of being adulterous. After the rape, she called her husband and father to her, “confessed” to being raped (it was seen as the woman’s fault, no matter what) and then killed herself to preserve her family’s lineage and honor.

Roman women didn’t even have real names. Each daughter was given the feminized version of her father’s name. If there were more than one daughter, they would be named Julia Major (older daughter of Julius) and Julia Minor (younger daughter of Julia).",Thanks for the rec! The Aeneid thus far has treated the women characters as mere convenient plot devices. Some truly WTF moments.,"After you finish The Aeneid, you should read Lavinia by Ursula K. Le Guin. It takes a basically wordless woman in The Aeneid who plays a key role as Aeneas's wife and gives her a voice and agency and really beautifully fleshes out who Lavinia was to the story.","I read Song of Achilles before Circe, and it was, as you said, very helpful. And so good too! I'm reading The Aeneid right now so I'm getting bits of the whole Trojan War saga from all these different works. May I recommend Stephen Fry's Great Mythology series, beginning with Mythos? Listen to the audiobooks, if possible. Fry has such a lovely enthusiastic way of telling the story. 

I haven't read Eleanor Oliphant, but will look for it! I liked Piranesi, but not sure I really ""got"" it.","If you havent read Song of Achilles yet, please do so. Same author and style, and reading Circe first gives you some between the lines character building of Achilles' mother, which touches on the themes in this thread. So damn good.

39,">I knew a woman who adored babies, but lost interest once they could speak.

That might be a woman who simply can't stand toddlers, I know they can be very difficult, but it also reeks of narcissistic mother to me - likes infants she can dress up like dolls and use as extensions of herself, but no longer likes the child once they're able to form and express preferences that might differ from hers.","Thanks for doing that! There’s so many cool subreddits out there; hopefully someone knows of some data. 

I do love a good tangent. ❤️  I could see communal childcare reducing the need to opt out of getting pregnant/having a child.

I know a smidge about infertile women in BaManianga society but because having children was part of how you became an ancestor I can't conceive of a woman admitting openly to not wanting children. Second wives were a not uncommon strategy if the couple was infertile but a lot of childcare was communal and the wives lived together away from the husband so I'd imagine there was high involvement even on the side of the infertile first wife.

I literally used to beg my parents not to have anymore kids after me (I'm the youngest of my siblings). It's disgustingly common for those of us who don't want kids to be told we'll change our minds, all women want children, no - you can't get sterilised because what if you meet the right person. 

Why is it that if a 16 year old girl accidentally gets knocked up and goes through with the pregnancy, no one bats an eye but a woman in her early 30s whose never wanted kids ""might change her mind""?

People outside of /r/childfree tend to think it's a toxic sub because sure, some people don't like kids but honestly there's a lot of support and we can all commiserate with each other about our frustrations of what it's like to be a person who genuinely does not want children.

Agree to disagree for sure","You can set your own standards, that's fine. But in my experience, setting higher standards gets you a better, more considerate partner. So I will always advise women to leave if they aren't being considered. Feel free to not follow that advice.","If I was in a relationship and someone got me a Christmas present I didn’t ask for or even allude to wanting and I showed appreciation, but didn’t get them anything and then got broken up with immediately without discussion, I’d think that person was nuts.

I’d never do this, but if I *said* I’d get something for them and then didn’t, I’d be more understanding if they wanted to end things immediately, but I’d still think an immediate break up without discussion would be a drastic move.

There are plenty of fish in the sea, and women have historically been taken for granted when it comes to hetero relationships, but what I see now is a lot of people over-correcting and just sifting through men until they find the perfect man that does the perfect things.. and I just think that’s so silly because no one is perfect and if you expect your man to know all the “rules” of common courtesy and won’t sacrifice a second of your time to discuss your expectations, you better be fucking perfect, too",No. I don't think you should ever have to ask for common courtesy. I refuse to ask people for basic consideration. There are better fish in the sea.,"Yes, but there was a key thing you said there: “keep asking for common courtesy”.. I personally am just waiting for OP to say explicitly that she has had a conversation with her SO.

She says this has been happening for two years and she said he said he doesn’t celebrate Valentine’s Day (but I wasn’t under the impression that the topic of the gift giving empty promises is what led to him saying that.. I took it as them speaking generally about that particular holiday.. I could be wrong though of course) and then she said she’s just not going to get him a gift anymore..

She never said she that in two years she’s ever actually had a conversation with him about this thing that clearly bothers her.. maybe she did, but I don’t like filling in contextual details in order to form an opinion.. I’m very curious to know what he’s said when she really brings it up.. if she has..

People are going to walk all over you if you let them.. and if it turns out that OP just kept expecting her SO to spontaneously change without having a real conversation, I have no issue putting some of the blame on her for not standing up for herself.. hints and passive aggressive huffs and puffs doesn’t translate (which I know is a huge assumption there - I’m just giving a generally example).. but yeah, if you’re in a relationship for two years and don’t feel comfortable being straight up and having a conversation or just otherwise letting something like this go on for two years without explicitly discussing what your expectations are, that’s not completely on the SO..

All that said, IF it turns out OP has in fact been continuously “asking for common courtesy”, I’m 100% with you and the majority of the people in these comments..

And actually, I’m not even an advocate for second chances honestly.. setting a boundary one time should be enough.. if they care, they only need to hear it once and there are plenty of potential partners out there who “only need to hear it once”.. I feel like a lot of people are taking what I say as “be patient and lenient on men because they don’t know better” which is not my sentiment at all, but people are responding to me like that’s what I’m saying.. I am literally just saying: “step 1. say something”

Am I assuming she hasn’t said anything yet? More like, she didn’t say she said anything so I am taking that as she didn’t say anything.","I think the opposite - people take yellow flags and don't have the proper caution, and that's how they end up in relationships like the one OP describes, where their partner fails to show up time and time again. I've dated too many people like that to even give them a chance - and then I ended up with a great guy who *doesn't* drop the ball. It's better to be selective than having to keep asking for common courtesy, imo.","I mean, I guess we’re all just different, but if I were in this situation, it would clearly be an issue (if he wasn’t giving presents, but I was), but it’s no where near deal breaker territory for me.. especially if I haven’t even had a conversation about it first.

I posted another long winded reply elsewhere, but I just think the yellow flags in a relationship are worth a conversation before jumping ship, because people just think differently and prioritize differently.. my sister once blew up at me for something I didn’t see coming one bit.. it was just a blind spot for me.. off the record: I still don’t quite understand why it was a big deal or how she even cared to put so much energy into being bothered about it, but guess what? I didn’t say any of that stuff to her, because whatever her reasons, it clearly bothered her and I care about her and that was enough for me to care about this thing that bothered her and be more attentive to it.. I think the “you can’t change people” is taken too literally and rigidly..

Additionally.. the other side to this is determining.. hey, is this a yellow flag? or is it an incompatibility? If it were me, I’d be on the other side of this.. I *hate* giving/receiving gifts.. the only difference between me and this guy is that I would never say I’m gonna give someone a gift in the first place.. if he got me a gift, I’d say “ohh you didn’t have to do that! Aw, thank you! I feel terrible I didn’t get you anything” and that’d be the end of it.. if that happened several more times, honestly, I’d be as uncomfortable as he felt slighted, like.. he’d think “why isn’t she getting the hint that she should be getting me gifts” and I’d think “why isn’t he getting the hint that I don’t do gifts”.. that’d be an indication of incompatibility.. then if we have to have a conversation, depending on how compatible we are in the other areas, if he really expressed that he’d appreciate more gifts, I’d absolutely give in without question.. but if he says “oh, I was just doing it because I thought you were supposed to but if you really don’t care about gifts, giving or receiving, then we don’t have to do that”, that’d be even better

Honestly, I only like giving gifts if I know the person is going to like it.. like if there is something I know he’s been eyeing for a while and a special occasion is coming up, I’d definitely get it.. if a special occasion wasn’t coming up, I’d just get it as soon as I could if it was something I could afford readily.. gifts for the sake of gifts straight up makes me nauseous and gives me anxiety, giving and receiving.. to have it deemed as “who would want to be with a person who doesn’t give gifts on special occasions” - I take that personally.. and I just really don’t think that’s a hard rule the way a lot of people here are making it out to be","Does she really want to date someone who doesn't take the time to think ""hey maybe I should find my gf a gift like I told her I would for this major holiday that many many people give gifts for and my gf gave me one two years in a row"". Even if he's not malicious, he's dense and the opposite of thoughtful - how far does this extend into their relationship? Deal breaker."

Keep trying. You will find a way.",Yes it would be life changing for me. When I originally went to college they were selling us all on the PSLF but that turned out to basically be a massive scam.,"Sounds like you are up against a lot of those - some of them you would face regardless of your education. But, student loans on top of that is not helping. Have you applied for relief? It may not go through, but the answer is always no if you don't apply.","I think that disregards the very real barriers of peoples situations. With the cost of daycare in my area my entire check would go to that so there would be no purpose of me working full time outside the home. Many of us have limited options. I can’t control the cost of child care or that I live in a very HCOL area. I have the best paying job I can, can’t make a higher paying job hire me.","Not being rude, but is that your only option or the only one you like? Most of us have options, but you may not like them. The problem is when anyone is told they can have it all. Life is always full of choices and options. People with less education often have fewer. 

Ask yourself what your options would be if there were no barriers. Then find a way around the barriers. Usually it is our mind and our expectations that are the biggest barrier.","I’m willing to give up my career for children, but if I’d known that’d be my only option I wouldn’t have wasted my time","Some people want to have children though, and would rather give up their career to care for their children than focus on their education and career.","Interesting perspective.  IMO, we shouldn't be saying getting an education is the problem here. The problem is that anyone has to ""mommy track"" themselves, ever."
56,Absolutely. In other countries it wouldn’t be an issue but this is America with no affordable child care or paid maternity leave. Idk how anyone manages to have a career unless they pull like 200k,This should be talked about more than it is. It's fucked up that women have to choose between career and having a family. I got lucky in the sense of student loans but not so much in the career part. I really hope you figure something out that works out for eveyone involved. No one should feel like they have to decide between kids and a fucking career.,"I’d say it’s about the education because if I knew I’d be stuck here making the same crappy pay I made with a bachelors degree, with no access to childcare I wouldn’t have bothered to go to school and waste all this time.",Sounds like that's the barrier not your education. And that's okay. And it's okay to feel let down after you were told you could have it all. Sometimes life simply gets in the way fair or not. So glad you are caring and helping your brother-in-law. Sounds like education was sadly never even an option for him.,We are trying but we my husbands brother is profoundly disabled and we help care for him so we can’t just pick up and go hours away,Move to a LCOL area.,"Yeah absolutely, if I had access to affordable daycare that wouldn’t cost more than my mortgage/take home pay I wouldn’t be on the “mommy track”.

The only people I ever got attitude with were people that called asking for directions and were so entitled to hold up an emergency line.","I once called 911 because a car had stopped in front of my house and the man inside started screaming at and shaking the woman, it was escalating too.I didn't feel safe intervening. 

The 911 operator gave me such attitude, I couldn't believe it.","I don’t understand why people ignore things like that.

I keep a tally of 911 calls… last year I made 14. Couple car crashes, couple of overdoses, fires, etc. but about half were women being harassed/stalked/attacked by male partners.

Most of the time I never run into people again so I never know how things turned out. But at least two of those women did find me after and say it might have saved their lives. How is that not something worth doing, especially when all it costs are a few minutes on the phone?

I understand that it can be overwhelming or sometimes even dangerous to intervene directly, but there’s no excuse for not at least calling for help when someone is in need.","Omg your story is so harrowing. This could have been me. My ex used to always resort to strangling me. It was his MO. 

No matter how loudly I screamed for help while trying to run away from him or talked about it with people practically begging for help, no one ever did.

You helped. Not everyone does."
58,"I'm so sorry to hear another story like that, I have been so incredibly lucky to have such amazing support. As you said, it's so vital. My abuser was wealthy, which didn't help- he thought he could just buy an expensive lawyer. Worked for awhile, against combined testimony and SO much support it did eventually fail.

You know the "" If I was rich "" question? I'd quite seriously fund all the relief organizations and fund lawyers who take simply no crap.",">Also had amazing, very strong family support.

This is so important for an abuse victim but often gets overlooked. I knew a woman who escaped her abuser only to have some family member tell him where she was. He  dragged her back.  She thought he had the ability to find her wherever she went. (This was in the 80's so no apple tracking devices. )I tried to tell her that her meth addicted husband doesn't have an inside with the government to track her down but she believed him because she couldn't accept that someone in her family betrayed her.

Someone very close to me had their father-who they adored- tell them to go back with the abusive asshole because she had a child.","Right. What happens is, the longer she's pretty much forced to stay with him, the less hope and mental ability she has to leave. Despite what it looks like it is a form of brain washing. 

When I was in a safe house a therapist or someone ( don't remember who she was, not a lot was registering at that point, I was just terrified ) gave a group talk. Onus was how not to go back to an abuser.

Asked her later "" How many go back? "" Seemed surreal to me, he didn't have his claws into me that deep yet and I had a baby to protect. She looked around, made this almost hopeless gesture said "" All of them "". I said "" I won't "". That doesn't make me special, like I said he didn't have his psycho claws deep enough into me yet . Also had amazing, very strong family support.

Please do report, every time. Might be someone not too far into a psycho's power to break free. Have always worried about those other women. And their kids- there were other kids in there too. Also wish that woman could know I didn't go back . The baby that was saved is now a doc. She knows about her father, goes to therapy and by a wonderful stroke of fortune he's dead.

And I'm happy about that too. Don't care if that sounds heartless.","People ignore it often when people choose to be with someone abusive. Because you call the cops on someone for beating his girlfriend and the cops show up and the girlfriend is defending the boyfriend, saying leave them alone, calling the person who called the cops an asshole and getting in their face about it.

That's the problem with abuse, people stay with their abusers and people who try to help them get pushed aside as interferring or all manor of other justifications. Shit sometimes they'll call you jealous or upset you don't have anyone and just trying to ruin their relationship.

I had to call the cops on the people in the apartment right by mine as after a week of partying noises and frustration it suddenly got way worse, shit flying off balcony, sounded like a proper beatdown going on. Called cops and they had to threaten to break in as the guy responsible locked himself in while the 'victim' had fled by then. Turns out they managed to bend a steel bar reinforced door, smashed balcony window, one of them went through a table and a guitar and tv got thrown out the balcony. 

Pregnant girlfriend and his family stay there (despite accusations he beats her). A few weeks later I here another fight but the other guy had already moved out so it was the guy and his pregnant girlfriend. I heard what sounded like her saying ""I can't breathe, stop"" so I called the cops and went to knock on the door at the same time to try to stop him doing anything worse before cops got there.

She eventually left and I walked with her to her car, she was thankful but also made excuses for him, didn't stay to talk to cops (though they talked to her later). 

Cops basically couldn't do anything, the friend who got put through a table and door did nothing, she didn't leave and was back there the next day, all I got was the stink eye from both for calling cops.

That's the issue, you interfere and the abused dramatically more often than not stays with the abuser. You get emotionally invested, you feel responsible by calling the cops, you have to talk with cops and take the anger from the people you called the cops on and the result is usually that the abused gives you shit as well as the abuser.

60,You're also blaming the victim rather than acknowledging he refuses to release her from his violent control. Women are killed when they leave. Many women leave but are never free of the BS. I'm in police family support groups. The violence perpetrated on women who have left is insane. Years afterward. The obsession is unimaginable.,"> Sounds like you're making it about you and your experience rather than the potential danger that you could be stopping by calling.

Except I called the cops and you're looking for something that isn't there. i'm explaining why so many don't, it's that simple. I called the cops and despite a guy strangling her, despite him being taken into custody and the fact that she walked out of there on her own before the cops got there, she went back to him.","Sounds like you're making it about you and your experience rather than the potential danger that you could be stopping by calling. Stink eye and awkwardness is better than waking up and finding she died or is in the hospital because no one called to help.

61,"This still has nothing to do with what I said. Stalking and obsessive exes are a major, massive issue, but one that is very difficult to deal with as laws aren't really designed to stop people who haven't broken significant laws. Stalkers are an issue around the world because people who follow you and call your work, try to get you fired haven't broken any laws by doing so yet. 

But again, that has nothing to do with anything I spoke about. Leaving someone, leaving the house you live with your partner in and are in a relationship with is what I'm talking about. How you deal with an ex who won't leave you alone is a completely different situation. For one thing you have to leave said relationship and stop living them to be in the situation you're talking about.

You said what I talked about was a jurisdiction issue, but you're talking about something that I didn't mention once.","WTAF? I left 5 years ago. All of them women I know who have left, upper middle class postgrad educated women are still being tormented by violent obsessive nut jobs who police and judiciary reward at every vindictive step they take.

We have legislation in my jurisdiction bit the police and judiciary refuse to enforce it and loudly bang on about perpetrators rights. Police are the problem.

ETA: despite your dirty deleted you're still ignoring what I've said about laws that exist that aren't enforced.

I absolutely know how abuse works, you do not. Someone gaslighting you is doesn't mean you have no choices. If you choose to ignore teh abuse and allow their lies to persuade you to stay that's still a choice. 

Cutting them off from friends and family is a choice you allow to make, and yes I understand why it happens. but being cut off from friends and family in no way means you have no choice but to stay and saying their is no choice is frankly gross.

Saying they have no choice gets people killed, they have a choice, you're denying that they have authority over themselves, you're treating abused partners as not just victims but wholy incapable of acting on their own. 

It also ignores that eventually, after the 15th time they get back together and finally leave their abusive partner, it's because they exercised their choice.

I had to call the cops on the people in the apartment right by mine as after a week of partying noises and frustration it suddenly got way worse, shit flying off balcony, sounded like a proper beatdown going on. Called cops and they had to threaten to break in as the guy responsible locked himself in while the 'victim' had fled by then. Turns out they managed to bend a steel bar reinforced door, smashed balcony window, one of them went through a table and a guitar and tv got thrown out the balcony. 

Pregnant girlfriend and his family stay there (despite accusations he beats her). A few weeks later I here another fight but the other guy had already moved out so it was the guy and his pregnant girlfriend. I heard what sounded like her saying ""I can't breathe, stop"" so I called the cops and went to knock on the door at the same time to try to stop him doing anything worse before cops got there.

She eventually left and I walked with her to her car, she was thankful but also made excuses for him, didn't stay to talk to cops (though they talked to her later). 

Cops basically couldn't do anything, the friend who got put through a table and door did nothing, she didn't leave and was back there the next day, all I got was the stink eye from both for calling cops.

That's the issue, you interfere and the abused dramatically more often than not stays with the abuser.

My mom stopped slapping us and started throwing us against walls.  Neighbors made comments about how strict our household was.

She used to berate or pinch or slap. She started grabbing your hair and slamming heads against objects.

Finally, she knocked my father down the basement steps and then went down and grabbed his head to smash it against the concrete floor. Neighbors continued to laugh at my father. Blaming him for the horrible abuse he constantly took. They would rather make jokes about his masculinity. They would rather watch this for decades.

I overheard gossip as they stood outside staring toward our house.

Hoping one of the adults would know what to do. But all they ever did was ignore or mock our suffering. 

Calling the police on my own mother was so emotionally difficult. Because the abuse teaches you to freeze or fawn to keep things peaceful. Survival is protecting and coddling your abuser. If you can just be good enough, keep them happy and calm...well, if they get angry it's your fault. Not theirs

 Living in abuse is a fucked up survival mentality
 
Calling the police on her would be counter to survival. Your whole body breaks down even considering such a betrayal. Even if it's in defense of your siblings and father, the thing is their survival is also tied up in the abuser. Your every instinct goes against protecting yourself.

 I had to learn to discard wanting to survive.  The hope for anything improving had to die entirely. And I was finally able to do something so traitorous as calling the police for help.
 
It was something I was only able to learn once I lost all trust in the community.

They knew. They did nothing. 
 
Neighbors looking the other way just means you are a silent audience to whatever comes next. Maybe they leave. Maybe someone ends up dead.  But years of trauma will continue unchecked.

64,"Right. I have a friend who was dating a girl a while back, and I suspected that she was abusing him. I knew him several years before he dated her, and we worked at the same place.

She told me that he was crazy, and abusive, and that he once put a cigarette out on her arm. Normally if anyone were to hear that you'd be alarmed for the woman. But this one was different. She told me this almost.... gleefully? And he was sitting there right next to her, not saying anything. As time passed, my friend was becoming increasingly sullen at work. She called him almost daily, accusing him of cheating on her. He would complain about her spending all of the money he had put in their joint account.

One day we all went out to eat somewhere and I think she said something I disagreed with, and logically explained why, which probably made her feel stupid. After that day, my friend started making excuses as to why he couldn't hang out after work anymore. On top of that, there were some other mutual friends they had that saw him as an abuser so they stopped hanging out with him. She was isolating him.

One day she texted me saying to stop giving advice to him. She claimed it was because his dad wanted them to only follow the advice of the couple's counselor they were supposedly both seeing.

I ended up messaging his dad on Facebook, and he was aware that she wasn't all that she was cracked up to be, and asked me to support his son, which I was going to do anyway.

Eventually they broke up, but was still wanting her to take him back. He was eventually served a restraining order. I went to the courtroom with him, but he accepted ended up not fighting it, and accepted the restraining order, which was the best thing he could have done.

But, to just lump them all together as ""weak"" is wrong - it is implying that someone needs to be perfect in these situations (and, I compared it to society's view of the perfect victim, too - one who leaves on the first offence and who behaves exactly as society expects - both are skewed views).

I highly doubt the podcast is likely to be the one sole source of information that's correct.... and even then, I doubt it would change my mind on the bystanders not doing enough. 


As long as a few people knew there was a physical attack occurring, and none of them made any meaningful attempt to help... even check to make sure she got back inside safely.  Or keep calling the police until they got there. 
Then they didn't really do enough.","I would recommend listening to the You're Wrong About podcast on Kitty, as there are some wrong facts even in your current comment.","Thanks for the link... I read up on it a bit more just now.

Some people still saw her get stabbed, then stagger away out of view. None went outside to see if she was okay. 

The people that saw the 2nd attack, after he returned to rape and stab her more... 


No one saw the full series of events. But about about a dozen people saw part of it. 
Two men were aware she was stabbed, one guy in the 1st attack. One guy was aware of the stabbing from the 2nd attack. But many more saw a woman getting beaten, some dismissed it as a ""lovers quarrel"". They didn't think a woman was being murdered, just another victim of domestic violence. 

Two of the 12 called police. Only one person went outside, a 70yr old woman who held Kitty as she died. After she was stabbed and raped. 

I'm sorry but 2 people saw her get stabbed. One only called the police AFTER she was basically dead, AND the old lady found her and started shouting:

""Intoxicated that night, Ross heard noises and after deliberation, cracked open his door to investigate. He saw Genovese laying on the ground, still alive and attempting to speak, and Moseley stabbing her. He shut the door and called a friend to ask what to do. The friend said not to get involved.

Ross eventually climbed out of his window and went to a neighbors apartment. He called the police after hearing Sophie Farrar call for someone to do so. Ross’ explanation—“I didn’t want to get involved”—became the famous rejoinder of the Bystander Effect.""


I have to read up on this more... to see if the 2nd guy who saw her get stabbed did anything... different info in different articles...","The Kitty Genovese case. Which was recently debunked - lots of people in fact tried to help. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/bias-fundamentals/201907/new-study-suggests-bystander-apathy-is-not-the-norm

I don't know why we discourage ourselves from mutual aid. Well, I can think of a couple of reasons in Western society. But in any case, it's nice that the evidence shows people can be awesome.","Absolutely. Doing everything they reasonably can to help. Even if it inconveniences them by making them late for something... it's worth it when a life is potentially at stake. After all... maybe the abuser doesn't kill the victim this time. But maybe they do next time, and next time they're quieter about it and it goes unnoticed. 


I just think of the infamous bystander case mentioned in psych... where a woman was beaten (iirc to death?) in an alleyway, and not a single neighbor called the police... though several heard and/or saw it happening... one did shout out from their window. Which briefly scared the guy off. 

Any neighbor could have likely gone outside, or grabbed something to use as a weapon, and simply scared the guy off with their presence. But no one did.","... Or trying. We can't individually make them stop, but yes, everyone must try to support others who need help. Otherwise what is the point of us?","This. In my experience, most people don't call. Don't interfere. Most people are not good people. A good person would interfere if able, or at least call AND ensure the police found the right place and were able to intervene. 

Most people don't want to be bothered, tbh. And like to think of themseves as good because they would never beat their wife... but that's not all it takes to be good. Being good also includes stopping people doing bad shit.","Omg your story is so harrowing. This could have been me. My ex used to always resort to strangling me. It was his MO. 

No matter how loudly I screamed for help while trying to run away from him or talked about it with people practically begging for help, no one ever did. We even had roommates who KNEW and saw what was happening and would go in their room and lock the door rather than help or call the cops. Only once out of 3 years did the cops ever get called and I found out the next day they went to the wrong place and didn’t even follow up or try to find the true source.

69,"That's an interesting topic... thanks for the book recommendation, I might have to read it. There's definitely lots of bullying types in my workplace.

Seems like it might the workplace version of a pdf I got on reddit : ""Why does he do that"" by Lundy Bancroft.  Which focuses on abusive relationships iirc.


Idk. A long time ago, in middle school... i found out another girl was being raped by her father. I didn't tell a guidance counselor because I didn't want to make her situation worse. I've checked up on her facebook, and she seems to be well adjusted and living a happy life. But what if things turned poorly? She was always cutting her wrists (self harm, not suicidal)... what if she died? I probably would have regretted not speaking up. I'm glad she turned out okay. But I don't like to live with regrets, wondering if things would have turned out differently if I had just DONE something or said something. 


I might regret it if i get seriously and permanently hurt trying to help someone. But i definitely will regret it if I provide 0 help. If that makes sense.","Of course. 

There's an interesting book, *Nasty People and How To Avoid Being Hurt By Them.* (I think. It's been a while) It's more about manipulative workplace bully types, not physical abuse. But the lesson is the same - Why do people say/do nasty things? One main reason is because they don't feel good about themselves, and they boost their own self-esteem by putting others down. For the physically abusive, this means inflicting hurt so they can feel that they are superior, because deep down they know or suspect they are less than others and can ""prove"" this is not so by being the physically dominant.","If they're gonna hurt a victim for someone trying to save them, they were going to hurt the victim anyways. 

Interfering doesn't change anything when you have someone violent who is looking for an excuse to abuse.


Ie. The abuser will say ""I'm only doing this because you tried to escape"". But if they didn't try to escape? Then the abuser will say ""I'm only doing this because you didn't wash the dishes"". 

It's like how a cheater will always cheat... an abuser will always abuse. They just make up excuses and find anything wrong so they can try to explain their behavior. When deep down it's just that they're fucked up.","Very good points. 

Except - nowadays, a bully knows the power of a phone and will see any move to call, record, or whatever as a provocative move. And, they are unpredictable. Stand well back, be ready to run. 

I'm an average height, slightly(?) overweight guy - but I haven't been in a serious fight since grade school. I seriously doubt I could take on some guy who has a habit of physical violence and a berserker attitude where they could be aggressive without regard to themselves getting hurt.  I don't want to find out the hard way, because if I lose the victim- if they don't want to leave - is no better off than when I started. Most likely worse, now the guy is angrier. ""See what trouble you brough onto me!!??""","Calling 911 takes less than a minute, assuming you know where you are. (And you should always know where you are tbh, pay attention to street names and businesses nearby... or look for a nearby house #). 

Then hit record on your phone. To get video of the person and what they look like. What they're doing. 

Telling them you called the police and are recording them will often get some to stop without a physical altercation. 


It can be a bit more obvious if they're on drugs or drunk... in that case just keep your distance. 
It shouldn't be too hard to outrun a drunk if you're in even half decent shape. 


I'm a petite woman who weighs just over 100lbs. Doesn't mean i would just run and hope the police or someone else did something. If i get hurt. Then i get hurt. But at least i wasn't a coward who stood by and didn't even try to help someone being actively hurt. 


Granted, physically interfering depends case by case. If you see a stranger attacking someone for no reason (ie a random street attack or something), then take into account, can you AND the victim handle the stranger? Are there any makeshift weapons you can use nearby? 


Domestics are a bit different. Because the victim has to be the one to want to leave. And if they aren't ready to leave their abuser, they'll likely attack you or get mad at you for interfering. And let's be real, there are very few cases where a woman is being locked in a house and 100% unable to physically leave. They usually stay out of a misguided sense of love. And repeatedly willingly go back home to their abuser.","The problem is... what are you going to do?  The aggressor is likely drunk, and obviously acting irrationally. Unless you're the type who can definitely win a no-hold-barred bar fight, the moment you get involved you put yourself at risk. 

Calling the police is obviously the best idea. However, you are dealing with an irrational violent person. If you even open your door or knock on theirs  to tell him off, and then the police show up, he may simply blame the person who told him off. Just call the police and let them handle it.","This. In my experience, most people don't call. Don't interfere. Most people are not good people. A good person would interfere if able, or at least call AND ensure the police found the right place and were able to intervene.

It's very good.,"This is the easiest way to explain consent to a guy I've found!

That or the tea cup metaphor.","My brother said for years that spouses can't say no. If you want to read my response you can but I'm putting a trigger warning for you now. 


I know he is slightly homophobic. I asked. What if she wants to peg you? Can you say no? 

Of course he freaked out ""No, what's wrong with you?""

Me: ""But what if she's really into it? Or really wants to be in you?"" 

Shuts it down every time. Wish I could say it makes him think.","I want to believe this but I’m not so sure. Many men seem to think sex in a marriage or relationship is something they can negotiate about because they “have needs”. I think a lot of people in general, don’t really know what consent is. If it’s not enthousiastic, it’s not actual consent. A lot of people probably don’t realize they are assaulters or rapists, both men and women, though I think rape and assault happens to us women a lot more (more often multiple times during our lives).","If you want facts. Most men are decent. Guys that rape or harass tend to have multiple victims. 

So while every woman has a story about assault or harassment,  many guys are surprised by how common it is."
71,"You can believe that, and I'll continue holding people accountable for their actions.","Hundreds of full adults are investing in gold honestly believing that within 6 weeks the US will cease to exist. And screaming at their confused children that wonder why these previously sane people people are throwing all of their resources away on something worthless. 

They don't believe that because they are idiots or insane. They believe that because someone convinced them to listen only to the news they provide. 

Honestly I find people are imbeciles more often than not. I see it in my daily life as well. 

And it is my firm belief that education could cut down on violence, rapes, shooting, abortions, etc.","If you're raping someone and putting your penis in a vagina you know where it goes. That makes no sense. 

We hear no a million times a day in various contexts. All of a sudden men don't know what no means when it comes to sticking a body part in someone? Lol bs. 

I'm not confusing anything with anything, and was referring to intimate partner rape when I said that. Strangers don't gaf regardless. Again, if those same boyfriends said no and their gf did something anyway they'd absolutely know they didn't want it. 

It's not rocket science and you're treating men like they're imbeciles and likely make other excuses for them.",">We all know what ""no"" means. 

At the age of 15 and having completed sex ed I still had no idea that a penis can go into a vagina. That is a little detail that many programs leave out because parents object to children seeing diagrams of sex or detailed descriptions. 

The main education of sexuality is porn, where ""no"" means something other than ""no"". Any other view is naïve. 

>We all understand consent. Flip the scenarios around on the rapist and they'd suddenly understand if it happened to them. They want what they want and the rest doesn't matter.

The mass majority of rapes are confused boyfriends that go too far. You are confusing that with stranger danger where a stranger breaks in and rapes.","Lol a rapist doesn't care about education and communication. We all know what ""no"" means. We all understand consent. Flip the scenarios around on the rapist and they'd suddenly understand if it happened to them. They want what they want and the rest doesn't matter.",Which again turns it back into a matter of education and communication.,"Whether they believe it or not, rape is rape. That doesn't change anything for the victims.","Very few rapists believe they are rapists. They do exist, but not the majority. Everyone is the hero of their own story."
72,"Hmm indeed, I always thought that mu expectations are too high but in the end this is what I want.. thanks for sharing your thoughts..

If your partner is not living up to your expectations, even after you've made them abundantly clear, that's on them.

You deserve to be happy and fulfilled and if your current partner isn't doing it there's no shame in finding a new partner.",It’s true..  but I feel like is my issue because I had the urge to look somewhere else because I have expectations from him which he didn’t meet. He is trying but not hard enough.. and who am I to expect things from him?,"I don't know, I'd be less worried about the fairness of telling him or not and the consequences of him finding out for himself somehow. Not telling him about something like this is going to seem like you're hiding it and that's going to make it look like a bigger deal than it is if the information comes out. Regardless of how much it's your own stupid issue, you should still be able to rely on your partner for moral support in dealing with it. What's the point of having a partner if you can't count on them to help you out when times are tough?",Is not about honesty.. I think is more about if it is fair to drag him in thing stupid situation.. is my issue and I need to work it out,"What would hurt worse? You telling him now that you're having these feelings and asking for his help to deal, or him finding out on his own at a later date possibly after things have escalated further?

84,"Thank you for this. It’s very easy to say “no sane person would do something like that”, but these guys don’t behave like someone who’s (medically) delusional. They’re angry, filled with hate, lacking respect and remorse, and convinced that their reasons are justifiable, but they know it’s murder and do not care.","Yep. Logically, extreme violence is an indicator that the perpetrator **is not** mentally ill, so they should be handled with a level of wariness that **exceeds** that used around people who are genuinely mentally ill. 

The violent perpetrator has the greater capacity to assess, plan, mislead, and enact violence - a true and ongoing threat to anyone who gets close enough. 

People are unsettled by the perception of unpredictability in a mentally ill person, but perceived threat does not translate to actual threat. The average person wants to think that a sane person (as they think they themselves are) is not capable of such brutality. Spolier: some humans just suck.

Thinking mental illness = threat is a bias I wish everyone would examine within themselves. The world could be a kinder place if we did.","Thank you!

85,"I remember watching a true crime doc about a teenage girl who lured a 12yo girl into her car and took her out to this place in the woods and brutally tortured her before killing her. And unsurprisingly it turned out her parents had done some truly horrifying things to her throughout her short life. It made me so sad that the teenage girl, though she was the one who actually did the horrible acts to the other girl, was to be punished for the rest of her life because of what her parents had done to her. It disturbed me that her parents wouldn't even get punished for what they did either. Our society is all about pointing the finger and calling it justice and then we're shocked that horrible things keep happening. I think people have a hard time understanding that trying to help, to rehabilitate, to prevent, to teach, etc. is not the same as excusing horrible actions. 

I'm very sorry about your uncle.","People are so supportive of trauma victims—until they admit to committing some heinous crime during a trauma response, that is. Once victim becomes victimizer we call them depraved monsters. My dad used to say your empathy isn’t worth much if you can only empathize with people you understand, and I think that applies here. I really don’t think anyone *set outs* to become a sociopath.

I’ll never forget my mom telling me about my kind and mind-mannered uncle coming back from Vietnam asa very young man and maniacally running down a dog in the road. He later said he couldn’t clearly recall the incident, and was really disturbed by it happening. He also experienced what everyone called “extreme fits of jealousy” when he later married the love of his life, a widow to a young man who died in Vietnam, whose photos he would violently smash while hyperventilating. It seemed clear to me that there was a hell of a lot more to it than just “jealousy”.

I’ve been in relationships with people who were badly abused as children and have seen a couple different versions of trauma responses. When that shit hits, I really don’t think people have control. They become strangers to me, but also to themselves. These were people whose abuse ended by elementary school yet it clearly affected them deeply. Even with a therapist, with family support and a very motivated individual, it is really, really hard to undo that damage. And most people aren’t getting any of that.

I’m fairly sure there are statistics on this and the fact is that a significant portion of violent offenders in prison have experienced significant trauma. You can absolutely fuck up basic human development, like self-regulation and empathy, with the right combo of trauma and lack of support.

ETA: And I honestly don’t know why people act like suggesting there could be some reason humans seem more capable of heinous violence in some geographic regions vs others is “letting people off”, but I suspect it had something to do with the “justice=punishment” mindset that puts dangerous people in concrete boxes with each other so they can become even more poorly-suited due release into society.","I don't want to argue with you because I've got the whole gamut of mental illness myself, but it is very very common for abusers to have been abused themselves. They are often mentally ill. Well-adjusted people do not abuse others. And pointing out the mental damage that using violence as punishment for children causes can help teach folks to stop doing stuff like that. In general I don't think acknowledging the mental health of violent and abusive people is meant to demonize everyone with mental illness as violent, it's more so acknowledging that being violent is not normal and it often occurs because of abuse by caregivers.","Thank you!

99,"> if you genuinely don't trust your SA with sex

It's usually shortened SO for significant other, SA tends to mean sexual assault.","For lots of guys, throat fucking is a kink, including for me. I've only ever been able to do it a few times because most women don't like that gag reflex, and I totally respect that. Just make sure to set boundaries beforehand, and if your SA violate those boundaries, consider leaving. This is just to say that this kind of kink isn't far-fetched by any means. Hell, it's an entire category of its own on most porn sites. On the other hand, I've had gfs whose kink was rough play/hands tied/light slapping. This is not a kink for me at all and I feel super weird slapping a girl, even if it turns her on. I guess we're all very different and we all have our own kinks. Just make sure to set boundaries beforehand and make it clear that a violation of those boundaries will result in you leaving.

In this particular case, I think only you can make this decision. Like you mentioned, I don't know if your past sexual trauma is leaking into this situation or if you genuinely don't trust your SA with sex anymore. Look deep within yourself and decide how you feel about the whole thing and go from there. Don't listen to all of us as only you can gauge whether he is being genuinely sincere and whether you can move past this.

But forgetting not to rape your partner? Forgetting not to tell about other sexual partners?! That‘s just not things one can forget. The telling part requires planning to tell the boyfriend, and much more than a slip of tongue. And going on when she‘s puked?! That’s just insane. A normal spouse would ask if their partner is comfortable if anything out of the ordinary happens. And forgetting to be gentle? The fuck? Is he a roided up animal or what?","People who ""forget"" boundaries are lying. I have a friend who's in an open relationship, with the caveat that it's only when they're apart and they do not discuss their hookups by the request of my friend. All well and good. Except his boyfriend *repeatedly* ""forgets"" and tells him all of his escapades, which deeply hurts my friend, who has to re-establish boundaries, who then gets hurt again the same way. It got to the point that I had to tell him straight-up that this is not his boyfriend being inexperienced or forgetful, this is his boyfriend getting off on the power over him. And he *still got back with this dude*. 

Toxic people target vulnerable people who will go along with them and we have to not get so caught up in positivity that we make excuses for abusers.","And how many victims of sexual abuse end up in relationships with this sexual dynamic and whether or not it’s actually healthy or just retraumatising, especially with a guy like this who says he “forgot”  boundaries.

102,"Oh my God, that's horrifyingly",The reports that a record number of teenaged girls are being admitted to the hospital for anal tears makes me deeply uncomfortable and sad,"This. You immediately get branded as not being sex positive if you want to have a frank discussion about the increasing misogyny in porn or the bdsm crowd (which seems like everyone now.) I have a teen niece who talks to me, and know that so many of these girls believe that they have to do anything a boy wants to be desirable, even if it feels terrible. 90% of the porn online these days is extremely degrading to women, and this is mainstream now, not even seen as kink. Violently skull f'ing, hair pulling, spitting on women, calling them whores, slapping their faces, coming on their faces/tongues, etc. is all totally normalized as mainstream, not even branded as kink. I'm sex positive, but I think a lot of girls have been bamboozled into accepting sexual aggression and misogyny by shaming them for supposedly not being sex positive or cool if they don't want to be treated like garbage cans. Somehow I feel like our feminism has been used against us in today's culture to trick us into doing sh\*t that feels degrading and painful. I'm uncomfortable with the turn it has taken. 

I can't help but think of Armie Hammer, using the guise of BDSM to rape and abuse very young women, telling them they don't need a safe word and they belong to him to do anything he wants with them, burning them, carving his initials in their skin, biting them, beating them, choking them, all without explicit consent, going well beyond their limits and providing no aftercare when he left them behind, bleeding and severely bruised. All of that was done in the name of kink, and he thinks that just because he talked them into being tied up, that they no longer could withdraw consent for any act he chose to do to them. Each of those girls describes feeling totally confused and violated, but not having had the language to explain at the time how he raped them when they agreed to sex and even BDSM, but not the extreme violence that he escalated it to without their consent.","I try to be sex-positive and I get that BDSM is a thing but I wish we could have an honest conversation about whether a bunch of the men ""into BDSM"" that hurts/dominates women could just be violent misogynists who use kink to excuse their impulses","Guys who hurt you during sex actually just want to hurt you.

103,"100% agree! You have to really want it on your own and be secure. Any pressure or if it comes from a relationship is horrible.

My best friend was continuously raped by her boyfriend, coerced and blackmailed to go to these BDSM events, and only once did they not like his vibe.

BDSM is extremely dangerous for people who cannot for whatever reason defend themselves against their abusive partners.","BDSM is based off SSC- safe, sane, and consensual. Anyone in the community will tell you that there’s people who just want to abuse their partner and they are not welcome. In a sub/dom relationship the submissive one *always* is in control, because they can stop it whenever they want to.

I think it’s a safe bet that men who want to hurt women and use BDSM as a cover are more likely to have deeply ingrained misogyny that they can’t hide, whereas people whose sexuality is defined by kink and would be just as horrified as anyone else at the thought of actually hurting someone likely have a better understanding of interpersonal and societal power dynamics","I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to say that kink is like that in the majority of cases.

115,thank you! i was going to type a longer comment to that person saying essentially this but i really just don’t have the energy to argue about this anymore lol.,"Oh for fucks sake! Porn is not normal sex. It's manufactured for men, and uses women where it chews them up and spits them out. I'm from LA, the porn capital of the WORLD. And guess what? Every time there is an outbreak of fucking syphilis (which is really deadly), the clap, or pretty much any other STD, it can always **BE TRACED BACK TO THE PORN INDUSTRY**. 

Not to mention that it is very damaging to young children that are just coming into their sexuality and don't know shit about sex, to watch two adults go at it where the guy throws the girl around, chokes her, cums on her face, and skullfucks here. NONE OF THAT SHIT IS NORMAL. Women internalize this shit as young girls, and men internalize this shit as young boys.

We live in a country that really lacks in sexual education, and yet, porn is everywhere. That's pretty much what young children are getting as a sex ed. 

>Porn is a huge industry

Which is also largely unregulated and does not practice safe sex. People in porn circles DIE because of the rampant STDs that happen. Yet the porn industry doesn't give a shit about them, they just keep on keep on, refusing to get their male actors to wear condoms and practicing questionable business practices. You may be unaware of that side of it, but the porn industry is seedy as fuck in every possible way. 

I am very sex positive and don't have any pearls to clutch. But porn just keeps getting more and more extreme, and further and further away from what real sex is.","I highly doubt all these things you are clutching your pearls over are as new as pornography is, it’s more like we as a society have changed and people are more open and comfortable discussing their sexual proclivities. I’m also unsure why you keep trying to demonize porn, it can 100% be part of a healthy sex life (whether single or in a relationship), and you may be surprised to learn that not only do plenty of women watch porn, they also watch it with their partners and use it to open up discussions about mutual fantasies and kinks. Porn is a huge industry and there is literally something for everyone, some people really like the more hard core stuff (and there is plenty of it), but there are lots of people who like gentler, more female pleasure and couple/romance focused porn (and there is plenty of this as well).","In this case it wasn't.

I think that’s what’s behind situations where men will mansplain your idea back to you as if they just came up with it themselves.

121,I must have missed that one.,"Quote from OP:

And those that let it slide until the opportunity arises to be the knight coming to the rescue are just as bad as Paul.


I agree that her handling that situation was the best course of action, but sadly could have turned out differently if Paul had lashed out. Hell OP needs to keep an eye on Paul just in case he decides to retaliate later perhaps she should go to HR if she hasn't yet.","I don’t know. Allowing her to handle the situation can also show that they didn’t want to imply she needed a rescue.

Her handling it herself changed his behavior in a way another man interfering probably wouldn’t’ve.",">Men could have shoved him away

OP, beware of these others as much as Paul. They either don't have a problem/share his mindset and are simply more risk averse, or they're indifferent cowards who won't do a thing to stand up for you.

This shit should have been cut short by them at the first comment, anything short is fostering a predatory environment.","The fact that you had to slap him just to have the *immense privilege* of not feeling violated by a creep treating you like a walking commodity...

123,"Wow this is so profound and correct and completely relatable to how this has been going for me. Thank you again, kind internet stranger, for the wonderful advice and conversation. I am so thankful. This is a weird type of validation that I didn't even know I needed. I'm a bit lost for words but what you just said restored some of my peace.","People don't like admitting bad things happen.  We fear them and many people try to hide from the truth, that bad things do happen.

Men don't have to deal with the frequency, ubiquity, or severity of sexual assault so most chose to pretend it doesn't happen.  Lots of women like to prescribe traits to victims in an attempt to distance themselves from bad things.

This is one of those things that many people, men and women, will try to invalidate your feelings on.  They will try to make it seem less severe because they want it to be.  But it doesn't change reality and you need to listen to yourself better and not let others' convince you it isn't a serious issue.

Men do not need to be following you, or running after your car, or banging on you windows.  All that is really fucked.

It helps to crank your air on full blast and shoot it out of a cracked window with all the other windows up.",Wow you're totally right thank you for validating my feelings and making me realize the severity of this.

That's messed up behavior.",I've been trying to not let it bother me so much because honestly it could be so much worse. Like at least they haven't touched me.

Then he got my number and continued to harass me. I don't think anything you say past that point is going to work, except blanking them. I tried. Then I was telling the guys I worked with about it. They were older and told me to ignore him and he'll stop. Keep responding, even in a negative context, that's attention, and he'll see that as encouragement. I took their advice. It worked.

And if you insist, I'll probably tell you to fuck off.

I don't know how those words can be misunderstood. All decent men will leave if told I am taken. I can count the number of guys on one hand who still hassled me when told this and I am in my late 30s now. That's a lot of years. Most men are actually not that dense and take the hint on the first try. They understand that they should look elsewhere.

He said this guy was just looking for attention from me and by responding I was giving him hope that he could win me over.

I did let her finish the exam because I trust her as she's a doctor (and the nurses also did there best with me, like asking if I prefer a female doc or if either female or male is fine. I felt more prepared because I knew they took the time to check that with me, for instance.)

136,Good luck with everything!,Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I really appreciate it. I’ll have to update you once I have my MRI 😊,"Short answer: If it were my ovary, I would do the recommended follow up just for the peace of mind that it's probably not a cancer or something scary, but I really wouldn't lose sleep over it.

&#x200B;

Long answer: It's scary when anything shows up on a scan! I like to tell my patients that imaging is good for finding lots of things, both benign and bad. And as imaging gets better, we find smaller and smaller things. That's good because we catch the nasty stuff, like cancers, earlier, but we also find lots of small benign things as well. Doctors want to make sure any finding is in fact benign, so that usually requires follow up, whether following something over time, or a different kind of test, or both. It causes a lot of anxiety on the part of the patient, which totally sucks! 99% of the time it's nothing dangerous, but that 1% where we do catch something small so early makes a huge difference to those patients, so in the end is putting people through all that testing and anxiety worth it? There are varying opinions, so that's where the physician expertise comes in. I'm not a doctor, but I see this play out a lot, and never have I ever had a patient say they regret going through the testing to confirm something was benign.","Okay thank you, so this doesn’t seem alarming? I’ve never had anything wrong with me do the fact I need an MRI is terrifying lol","Occasionally. But usually only when they're really big and it just takes the body a while to break down all the blood products. My facility refers out for OB/GYN, so anything that doesn't resolve gets sent out to to a bigger hospital and I usually lose them to follow up. I will say tho, that the worrisome ovarian pathology almost always is big when found, or gets bigger quicker on follow up scans, like grows by centimeters in 6 months. The little 1-3cm endo cysts or teratomas usually stay pretty stable. I can't stress enough how small a 1cm ovarian cyst is in the land of radiology. It's really hard to be exactly sure what it is by ultrasound.",Thanks! That makes me feel better. I have one last question for you- Have you ever seen a hemmoragic cyst not resolve within the 3 months before and still be that kind of cyst?,"Generally not. Most commonly endometrioma or maybe a small teratoma. It's just over a centimeter big, that's very small to accurately characterize by ultrasound anyway.",Thanks. Is a hemorrhagic cyst commonly misdiagnosed for something more serious?
137,It was great wasn't it,"Burn notice, what a throwback to a great show (mostly)!","I keep revisiting a scene from Jessica Jones, season one when giving this advice. Trish knocks the mind controlled cop down, then runs. And is immediately in danger again. 

Contrasted with Fiona from burn notice. You see her and just know she can hurt you.","This tracks with something my dad told me once. My dad had a bit of a misspent youth, ahem, but he was able to impart this wisdom: ""If you ever have to be in a fight, don't worry about how you look or anything but doing as much damage as fast as possible.""","Martial arts in general, most likely. 

What wins in competition gets you hurt in real life.  The studio I trained with spelled it out for us. 

“Avoid fighting if you can. If you can’t, win. Winning means hurting someone. Your goal should be to put them in the hospital. Aaaaand here are a couple good ways to do that.”

And that line of thinking has kept me out of many more fights than it has helped me survive. 

And to the target audience of this sub, keep it in mind if you decide to take self defense training. Look for a school that will part this to you. Not the kick in the nuts then run philosophy. In that instance you have just hurt and angered a booger, stronger, already aggressive attacker. Who can likely run faster than you. If you gain advantage, press it. Do more damage. Enough that they will need medical attention. 

Physical confrontations are not neat, easy things. They are messy, painful, and can be bloody. If you find yourself in a situation that requires it, your safety and your life are paramount. 

SLPT: if you want to use a ‘work knife’ (seriously a good pocket knife has been my best work buy after good boots), splurge. Spend the money to get a sturdy one. I’ve been told a good squishy spot is the inner thigh, just above the knee.  Can’t be easily blocked, but if it is, whelp, you probably got the kneecap and a tendon or two. Either way, you walk away, your attacker does not.","Judo as a sport doesn't teach the grittier aspects.

Judo as a martial art sure does. Read up on its origins of monks who couldn't arm themselves from a religious requirement yet still maintain security of the gold leaf trade.","To add on to OP, here, if your interested, judo is a good one for throwing, but their are other martial arts that deal in joint manipulation.

I went with an ex and some of his friends to a concert at a huge motorcycle rally and everyone but me was drinking heavily. One member of this band  of idiots began to comment ""jokingly"" about the size of my breasts and how he would love to ""motorboat"" them. I very calmly informed him that I do NOT recommend that he try it, as I tend to react violently to unwanted touch. He thought that was hilarious, and took it as a challenge to try and hug me. Using every ounce of self control I have, I ducked and pulled away from his multiple attempts to hug me. I guess he thought that since he had touched me several times without violence, no violence was going to happen, i.e. that I was full of shit about my warning . This dumb motherfucker slammed his face between my breasts, shook his head back and forth and came up grinning. Several large bikers who had been paying more attention than my ex began to approach to come to my aid. That was unnecessary. I lifted my foot and smashed down & outward on the inside of his knee, which buckled his leg and brought him down low enough to get a solid uppercut into his chin. I knocked the little motherfucker OUT COLD!! When he came to, he was being handed over to event security by the now highly amused bikers who watched me drop him.

I recommend that you take some self defense courses that teach you to fight DIRTY.  You are naturally smaller and probably weaker, so there's no such thing as a fair fight if a larger man is trying to force himself into contact with you. That kneecap trick is one I learned in such a course. (Kick just above or just below the knee with a slightly down and sideways angle, it will often dislocate the knee, but it will always hurt like hell and slow them down). A good shit to the throat or solar plexus will fuck up their breathing and give you time to get away. Don't aim for the target spot. Hit like you are aiming for a spot six inches beyond the target!

146,You can keep your head buried in the sand if it makes you feel better.,"At the risk of repeating myself, I'm going to reiterate my comment because I don't think you're getting it.

You should go look at the post in question and read it. It didn't talk about any warning signs to look out for. There were no tips or any informative information about *anything*. If it had talked about any of those warning signs, or how to mitigate risks, than I would feel very positively about the post. But it was just a scare tactic. You probably still would have gone through what you did because reading it wouldn't have pointed you in the right direction for any medical advice. 

It's like me standing on the street and telling women not to walk down the dark alleyway, even if they *have to* to get to where they are going. Pretty useless.",Pregnant and people who can get pregnant need to know about the realities of what can happen. Knowing warning signs of issues and conditions can help save lives. I lost a full term pregnancy because I didn’t know the signs of an issue I developed. Not talking about the problems pregnancy can cause isn’t the solution. Not talking about it to avoid scaring women is what leads to scary shit. Edit: I also almost died during birth because I didn’t know some signs and symptoms of the condition I developed. It would have been a far different scenario if I had known to keep an eye on these symptoms and to mention them to the doc. I used the sunshine and rainbows like of my own volition. Did I say you said it? No! I didn’t so don’t get your panties in a twist.,">Acting like pregnancy is all sunshine and rainbows doesn’t really help.

Who the fuck said that? Did I ever say that? No.

 Listen, if you think that the pain of birth is glossed over, *I don't think you are paying attention*. People talk about it all the fucking time. And yes, most women in the US know that it is dangerous and can be rough. 

Yes, it can be helpful to really discuss it, and how to mitigate risks.  But that post was a fucking train wreck, with nothing but a very negative spin on giving birth, and made it sound like suicide. Sorry to break this news to you, but men raping and beating women is far more likely to happen than someone dying in birth. 

A woman is raped somewhere in America **EVERY 2 MINUTES.** A woman does not die in birth every 2 minutes. Men kill women far more than birth does.

That's just a fact. Scaring women without offering them solutions on how to reduce risk is just again, not helpful. Pregnant people have enough to worry about already without those kinds of talks that offer no real solutions.",It’s helpful in that people don’t tend to mention this aspect of pregnancy and gloss over it.

153,"T'au are slightly smaller and weaker than humans. They are kind of like Grays (the alien type?) crossed with Abe from Abe's Odyssey or something. With badass anime mech suits. I match with them ideologically way more than the other factions.

Bad space elves are Dark Eldar. Games Workshop is cleaning them up now and making them more PC, but their models look like Jaba the hutt's slave ships and they had slaves on chains on past models I believe. Very pirate-rapey in the lore and video games. It was because of the depths of their debauchery and hedonism that the Chaos god Slaanesh was born. I think of them almost like Cenobites from the Hellraiser franchise.

Tyranids are like the Zerg from Starcraft. Literally almost the same, actually, since Starcraft was supposed to be a Warhammer game in early development.

Thematically I like the orks for some reason. Orks are like a fungus and grow out of the ground. An ancient, powerful, psychic race that was stricken stupid by the gods afraid of their power. Sexless, psychic, and stupid, their things actually do go faster when they paint flames on the side *just because they believe it does* like a little boy. Adorable and horrible like a kid on an ant hill with a magnifying glass.","I am just starting out with the Warhammer universe.

Who are the tiny little alien in mech suits that you mentioned?
And the space elves and the even worse space elves? I'm guessing you mean Tyranids?","Well, you see, the god emperor of humanity lies in a coma but with a consciousness that is awake and alert in the warp, the place through which you must pass for interstellar travel, and he directs all space travel through the warp where the demons live, and if it weren't for him anyone traveling through would come out corrupted by the forces of Chaos. But besides chaos, there are also space elves who are super xenophobic and want to kill you, and then even worse space elves that will enslave and rape and torture you. And also there are orks, they grow out of the ground like fungus, and they are so psychically powerful that all of their technology works only because they are stupid enough to believe it does. But they are also too stupid to realize how psychically powerful they are. Meanwhile there's an ancient race of robotic skeletons hellbent on killing everybody, as well as tiny little alien creatures with huge mech suits that share a lot of philosophical and ideological ideas with our Eastern religions while still having a ""join us or die"" attitude.

The not political part is because I've seen/heard people claim that MGS is ""not political"", which again misses the messaging and is really funny to me. 

I also think there's some stuff in those games that isn't particularly great. Nothing that makes me go ""I want nothing to do with this"", but in my mind it's reasonable to acknowledge that it's there. Like, I don't really like that the only queer characters are villains.

I'm also not really trying to get into a lore-off or anything. Also, I hear what you're saying about Meryl, but in my mind it's almost irrelevant how Snake feels about her.

I don't want to start spouting lore and story like people haven't heard it, but even though Meryl was into Snake, he wasn't really into her and he didn't save her for himself.

157,"For sure, the 90s era of objectification feels more than a bit off base from the overall tone the game tries to go for. 

She does hold her own, and if you dive into some of her calls, she gets fleshed out more, as a holdout during the original mutiny and other concepts that, to me, emphasized her strength of character. I think it's a shame it's somewhat hidden, but at the same time I get that being your perception/recollection of her character too.","So, it's been a while, and I may be basing this a bit more on feelings/impressions vs facts (AKA be totally off base). If I get something twisted please bare with me.

There are a couple things. One is simply that Meryl feels pretty unnecessarily sexualized to me. Like, you have the easter egg where you can see her undress by watching her workout a bunch. You also can identify her based on her butt effectively. Then again, there's the Psychomantis thing where she's all like ""Snake do you liiiiike me"", which I don't have a good reason for disliking but feels a bit yuck to me. 

Then there is her role in the game itself, which IIRC is generally you rescuing her. She plays the damsel in distress with both the Psychomantis and the Sniper Wolf (pt 1) fights.","Would you mind elaborating on what you feel is poorly written about her?

Our future would be in our own hands, as we had Title 9 (among other statutes). We experienced a burst of freedom at home, in the workplace and in the greater world. Now it feels like so many people would trade their (and others) freedoms for a temporary or illusory security and we're winding up with neither freedoms or security.

Still, I don't want all these young women to settle.  This is the time of push-back, I guess, and they need to face it.  Take heart from all those young women of Iran and their fight for their lives.  Because that's what's at stake.","I agree with you in principle completely. 

In practice, well, I’m tired and getting older … sometimes I take what I can get, y’know?","While that is sadly true, I think there's a problem sometimes when we settle for expediency (like we have to and are conditioned to do IRL) even in this sub and let the ""good guys"" speak for us.

It isn't because I think that makes a difference or makes my opinion profound - just the opposite. It would feel horribly disingenuous to not point out that I'm an outsider with a different perspective.

Edit: a number of the comments I do have here are trying to educate the... less savory men, in the hopes that they're just clueless. (The onus of that shouldn't be on the women here.)

I never thought to think of it this way. With the many men on Reddit it's of course very easy to drown out our voices. Thank you for giving me this insight!,"I once saw a thread on a woman-centered place on a different platform that talked about how women of color weren't being given a space, and so the thread was intended to be a dedicated space for women of color to be heard. 95% of the comments were white ladies replying ""I'm listening."" There were so many white women loudly performing their ""allyship"" that even in that dedicated thread, the voices of women of color were drowned out. I think the downvoting is probably coming from a similar place of frustration. When women come here, to a place where women's voices have claimed a space to be heard, they don't want to be drowned out by men's voices performing allyship. Because you can't listen when you're talking. I didn't read through much of the thread in question, but I've seen men's comments in other threads that sound more performative than supportive, in a notallmen or notliketheotherguys kind of way, and I can understand why women would respond to those comments with anger and frustration.","I got the idea that the post was purely directed at the toxic men who send Reddit Cares and hateful comments. So that's why the downvotes on the same comments, or allies, shocked me a bit. But perhaps they were interpreted as facing praise because they're good guys, as I've just read in a different post. And yes maybe they should have known better than to write those kind of comments just like you said.","I don't know this sub very well, or Reddit in general for that matter. But this post and comments under it specifically adressed how men should restrain themselves to comment unless their perspective is specifically asked for. So i can understand where the negative karma is coming from, and i don't think it means lurkers and allies aren't welcomed. Lurkers don't post anyway, and allies should know better than writing in a women space about how they are not like that.

Never read here someone asking another to disclose their gender before replying or not, so i guess it has to do also with how men come here to speak and be heard as such, without being invited to do so."

It's against democracy thinking that I can't have an opinion about something just because I am a male(remember, men can give birth, they have to be a transgender men, but still men). 

I never told women how to feel about childbirth, I just said my opinion. If you had read my comment instead of writing nonsense you would have realise that, even If I wanted kids, I was ok with the idea of my wife to not have kids and that I have never forced her to change her mind. So, even in my close life, I have never told a woken how to feel about a childbirth. If you had read better you would have realise that I, again, just said my opinion.

You know, I always had the dream of having kids but I discovered that I was almost infertile and my wife didn't want kids and always told me that. Then she hit 35 yo and she told me that she changed her mind and she wanted kids so we tried and we were very lucky because now she is 4 months pregnant.

It might sound kinda weird but I know they’re usually overlooked by the system so if I can help them out I would love too.,"I don't get it, you said that you don't want to raise a baby or a young child but now you want kids. 

I don't want to be rude but this comment make me feel like you are not certain of your decision and seems that you are just rushing.

164,"""Partially to blame is clinical and research bias that has long centered and overvalued male presentations of ADHD.""

Men are the default of study in all things medical. We actually push to just include women in studies. I updated the link for you.

Anyways, this isn't interesting or adding value to my day. Hope you have a good weekend.",We have discussed it before. I said I have no idea about when it comes to Autism Spectrum Disorder I don’t know why you keep bringing it up again as I said you are probably right a long time ago. I’m talking about ADHD and replied to someones comment to ADHD and you replied out of nowhere and keep bringing up Autism for no reason. Also never claimed to be super educated? I just said I have a bachelor’s degree and that’s all. I would not call myself super educated anyways.,"https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-in-women-girls-symptoms-diagnosis-recommendations/

Now I know you aren't nearly as educated as you claim to be. No one in phycology or medicine would ever claim men and women are studied equally... Cheers

ETA- LMAO ""doctors bias against boys"" troll","You missed the point no one is looking for green outsides, it's almost impossible to miss. Could you add a source as of why you think it's studied more in boys.  


EDIT: If you are a teacher and one kid disturbs the class to the point you literally can't continue with your class and it disturbs every other boy and girl too, then of course for the teacher the next step is to contact the school psychologists and parents in order to get the class back working. I'm not saying that teachers should ignore every other symptom or that this is the best course of action, but that is just how it is. This has nothing to do with the teachers or the doctors's bias against boys, far from it.","But the reason it is diagnosed more is it is studied more. Girls still have clear symptoms, but no one bothered to study them or educate carers on them. 

So everyone is looking for your green outsides when really they should be looking for green tongues. Green tongues are easy to spot if you bother to actually look, and know why it is important.","I don’t know where you are basing your points on. If you had a disease that would make insides of one gender turn green and outsides of another gender go green which gender would get diagnosed more? If girls also showed clear symptoms of ADHD then they would also get diagnosed as often. Again I’m not arguing about the purpose of the original post. I just wanted to clear up why it’s the case for ADHD. Not competent enough in autism spectrum disorder so not going to enter this “argument” as you may very well be right. 

Also I’m not trying to making this “boys vs girls” or anything like that just wanted to clear up some misconceptions about ADHD disgnosis rate.","That is the whole point! Women with diseases aren't studied, men with diseases are. Men with diseases are also what are written about in your textbooks.

So you are getting down voted because you are stating the obvious as a validation for your lack of care as a child. When really you should be upset that no one bothered to study female development with autism resulting in no one thinking you should even be considered for diagnosis.

Your explanation isn't flawed but the point you are making is.","That’s because boys tend to display
symptoms of ADHD differently.
Symptoms like
hyperactivity where as in young girls might not therefore it often flies under the radar with
parents and teachers. I myself
got diagnosed at 24 even though I showed all the symptoms one could. But since people
in general are not as aware or don’t believe in it, it
often goes unnoticed.

EDIT: Not completely sure why I’m being downvoted. I agree with the original post. Just wanted to clarify why males get diagnosed more as I have ADHD and have bachelor’s degree in Psychology so thought it would be an interesting fact to know. You can google it I’m not making it up."

Also another thing, the boyfriend may not actually have a ""rape kink"" but rather is experiencing [""groinal response""](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/symptoms-of-ocd/#TypesAndExamplesOfObsessions):

> Intrusive sexual thoughts may lead you to constantly monitor and check your genitals. This attention and the anxiety you are feeling may actually increase blood flow and physical arousal. This can make you feel as if you are aroused by the intrusive thoughts when in fact the opposite is true. Many people with this type of OCD call this 'groinal response'.",Thank you for that. OP terrifies me far less than the adoring fans in the comments that had no concept of such a complex history or reasoning behind his plain statement.,"So I decided to look through the comments of the deleted post a bit and found out that OP's boyfriend is a rape survivor.

I've heard some survivors of sexual trauma having intrusive thoughts of sexually victimizing someone the same way they themselves were sexually victimized and the fact these thoughts occur during arguments or when she decline his advances might be because that what happen to him before he was rape.

Of course this is me just theorizing, but now knowing that the boyfriend is a rape survivor himself does make me see the post differently now.","It scares me that she deleted the post with the overwhelming impression that most people thought that she didn't have anything to be concerned about. That someone would get aroused at the idea of what those people did to me, especially a partner I trust, is a fear I didn't even truly comprehend I had to have. I know my brain jumps to worst case scenarios all the time and that's on me, but even if my worries are unfounded, I wish her wisdom, courage, and safety in her journey ahead.","> I didn’t get the chance to read the post before it was deleted.

If you replace ""reddit.com"" in the url with ""unddit.com"", you'll be able to see the deleted post and comments.","Admittedly, I did look to see if you had responded to the post in your history before deciding to comment. I am an OCD sufferer and I have seen how misinformation not only harms but kills people in the OCD community. 

As a result, I made an account just for this. 

You’re completely valid in having boundaries and being unsure of the intention behind the comments as well as the boyfriend of that post. It is terrifying when we cannot know the true nature of other people. You’re allowed to not want to associate with people who have these types of intrusive thoughts. I’m just pointing out that many people have these types of intrusive thoughts. This does not mean they want to do these things, they like to think about them, nor do they even get the thoughts, enjoy them but then feel guilt about enjoying them. 

I didn’t get the chance to read the post before it was deleted. The way the comments were talking about it didn’t appear well-informed. For example, I saw a reply in the original post saying it isn’t acceptable to have intrusive thoughts of that nature and that you should get help. In reality, a well informed therapist wouldn’t give any credence to an intrusive thoughts and just treat for OCD or just tell you “a thought is just a thought”. Intrusive thoughts ≠ fantasies. This is an important distinction. 

I don’t know about the man in the post. Framing intrusive thoughts as a kink is incredibly misguided. He either is extremely confused. Or if it’s actually a kink, needs actual help so that he does not act on those urges. I must reiterate that, kink ≠ intrusive thoughts. This is generally the case, but in life nothing is certain. 

I bring up OCD,  because wherever intrusive thoughts are mentioned, OCD sufferers are sure to follow. Obsessions are often a fear that takes hold of an OCD sufferers mind. These obsessions can include contamination, perfectionist related obsessions, identity related obsessions (fear of being trans/not trans, being gay/straight), violent obsessions (fear of harming another person/yourself), and yes, even sexual obsessions (fear of assaulting someone, and those ones too). These are all common obsessions of OCD that are treated. Compulsions are the reaction to these thoughts which might be avoiding partners, knives, washing hands, checking the oven/locks, reassurance seeking, etc. 

Generally, these are completely harmless and are more dangerous to the sufferer rather than anyone around them. A person who might have intrusive thoughts about assault and compulsions related to making sure that doesn’t ever ever happen, likely doesn’t fantasize about assault as it is ego dystonic. 

I apologize for the long read. However, intrusive thoughts are severely misunderstood and stigmatized. Especially for those with OCD. The post you’re referring to needs more context so I can’t comment strongly on it. I wrote this post purely for educational purposes.","My wording was off. Limited space. Should have included ""just"" intrusive thoughts. Like that it was completely normal and the person who asked her boyfriend what his kink was said that it was raping her. And that it wasn't random. It was compelled by her actions. And that it turned into a sexual fantasy or his kink. The thought of someone thinking about raping me during an argument is almost unbearable. 

I immediately thought about if this was about children. Someone who has sexual thoughts about kids while around them but ""feels super guilty about it"" is not ok. Who would let their kids be around someone like that?? I think far fewer than would let women be around a man who thought about raping them.","Those are intrusive thoughts. They're other things too.

Create a safe space (you've been working on that for years it sounds like, but reinforce that safe space), make sure your son knows that you're open to answering any questions, and open to listen to any worries and fears he has. If he does open up about worries of fears, don't dismiss them, instead look for what could relieve those feelings together. 
Also, I'd check with him if there's someone at school (like a dean or counsellor) that he can speak with privately about things he might not feel comfortable speaking with you about. If possible (I know American healthcare is pricey) let him know some sessions with a therapist are possible so he has someone to talk with about this privately, who is also equipped to help him with all the emotions he might be going through."

I don't disagree that it isn't easy to filter, I disagree that it's being actively addressed in a meaningful way. Aside from that, you're talking about implimenting a chat filter rather than active consequences for poor behaviour, like say suspensions or bans. A chat filter will only prevent specifc words from being typed out, but that doesn't really prevent sexist, racist, homophobic, etc comments since you can be those things without using slurs. And a chat filter sure as hell does nothing against voice chat.

In addition, while universities aren't allowed to deny admittance because of race or religion, many use unwritten quotas that make it more difficult for certain people to be accepted into certain programs. 
Women are already placed at a tremendous disadvantage for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) careers, and POC women even more so. ","Please forgive me if I say anything weird, but I have a serious question.

Please do understand that I'm not a US citizen, so I'm completely oblivious to any knowledge about living in the US (aside of SJW's, rednecks/guns and overzealous law enforcement).

Why is it so special to be accepted in any kind of school? Why does being 'non-white' matter? I mean, everyone I know over here just see 'people' and not whites or blacks or whatever. For us it's kind of weird to NOT get accepted to uni, academy, ... I'm genuinely wondering about this.

182,Exactly! - thanks for helping me clarify,"Okay, sorry I misunderstood. I totally thought you were saying that this was women’s fault for not leaving when they saw this.

But now I get you’re just saying we should hold men to a higher standard. Especially at the beginning of the relationship. Which I totally agree with. 

Like, it’s not cute that you still send your laundry gone for your mom to do - it’s ridiculous.","I honestly think we agree on this. I absolutely think it’s a men problem! I’m sorry if I framed it as only a woman’s issue. And I can definitely empathize with people whose partners change late in the relationship and stop caring, as well as how difficult divorce must be. 

Your examples were good and I didn’t mean to dismiss them - it’s more nuanced than I made it seem. 

I guess my thoughts were more directed at newer relationships where it becomes obvious that you’re dating a man child and it’s easier to walk away. 💕","I’m saying it’s not an option because you don’t know until it’s very late in the relationship. And yes, you can divorce someone over their housework division, but most of the time, women are told that there aren’t any men that are going to do it any better so she should just be happy with the one she has.

I also like that you’re framing this as a women’s issue when it is absolutely something that men should address.","I appreciate all the examples, but it really does boil down to: you get what you tolerate. And it often really is that simple. Being able to communicate like an adult and being willing and able to walk away are really the only other requirements that come to play in your examples.

Edit: a lot of women don’t have the options we have in the US, but for most of us - just don’t marry or have kids with someone who can’t do housework like an adult

Edit2 lol: I disagree about “not an option” - barring extreme circumstances, you choose your partners! And no, I don’t think breaking up over something like someone being unwilling to contribute to housework is strange at all","That’s not always an option. Haven’t you ever had a roommate or anything who for the first year (or months) was great and took out the trash and always cleaned their dishes and such - and then after a while devolved and it strained your relationship?

Or, you’re dating someone, and when everything’s good, you’re great, but a stressor happens and then the relationship changes because you never went through any relationship-testing events earlier in the relationship? 

Also, if you straight up ask many people, I’m sure they’d say - yes, I’m going to carry my own weight. But then you have kids, and they’re tired after a long day of work, and slowly but surely they push work off onto their spouse. And you’re not going to divorce just because of that - especially if you’ve got kids. But you may get to a point where your spouse only does things if you remind them - and then, you’re either the nagging spouse or you get overwhelmed by the chores and blow up and then you expected him to read your mind.

Additionally, that doesn’t solve the issue that women shouldn’t have to interrogate men and come up with scenarios to see if they’ll pull their own weight. We’re gonna have to make it work so that’s the expectation. 

And a lot of women don’t even know to look for that. Before I left home - I thought everyone could do certain things. Then when I got to college I realized that (both women and men) were lacking housework skills. Women might just expect that men will pull their own weight and dive into a relationship. In my Catholic family, you’re basically a slut if you live with your bf pre-marriage (I don’t subscribe to that idea but just giving an example of a cultural norm). So she’s never lived with him, and now they’re married and divorce is frowned upon and she learns that he won’t keep up his half without nagging which he’ll blame her for. 

That doesn’t even touch on the fact that we’re still at a point where men generally have a higher pay then their spouse and that often gets held over their heads. Even if they spend the same amount of time at work. 

So yes, it would be great if we could just avoid those men, but it’s not always possible, and sometimes you don’t see that side of them until it’s late.

Plus, there is tremendous pressure for women to settle so that they can get married. Imagine she’s been dating someone for years and they finally move in together. He’s nice and funny and good-looking and whatever. But she notices that he never puts his dishes away and she’s always the one to vacuum and whatever. She might complain about that to her friends - but a lot of the time that wouldn’t be an immediate dealbreaker. They’d say - at least he’s not abusing you or cheating etc. And breaking up over some dishes seems strange right?

But then they have kids, and the burden of domestic work for her increases exponentially and all the little things build. Again, she’s trapped in the - do I become the nagging wife that he makes jokes about hating all the time or do I keep this to myself and become overwhelmed with work?",That is a fixable problem - stop choosing partners that don’t pull their own weight with housework.,"That is absolutely true, and working women end up doing most of the housework anyway so the workload is becoming even more unequal in a lot of households."
183,"That sounds fine honestly, I'm sure those women are much better off not being married than if they were with a shitty spouse.","That happened in South Korea, and more men will not “step up.” Feminism rooted itself really hard among Korean women but not among Korean men, so the marriage rate has dropped significantly because 1950s attitude men and feminist women will not tolerate each other (among other reasons like economic reasons). But men don’t step up, they end up just demonizing women even more and being more sexist, and everyone just ends up single","I agree it’s a men problem. So stop settling with ones that suck, and maybe more will step up.","Not a joke at all. Most men do not pull their weight with domestic labor or childcare (or elder care, for that matter). I'm not sure how you think women are supposed to find the few men who truly will, particularly when they're outnumbered by those who won't.

They often underestimate what it takes to run a household and care for children.","I’m assuming you’re making a joke?

184,"That's pretty much saying it is up to women to fix the problem, it is not and never should be. 

I grew up seeing my mum work long hours so i made an effort to clean and cook for myself. My Dad is from a very traditional family but i even saw him help around the house and he worked crazy hours. I think one thing they both instilled in me was just accepting basic responsibities. If the lawn is looking overgrown, get lawn mower out. If the floor is dirty get the vacuum or mop. If there are dirty clothes wash them. If you are hungry then cook something. It's all basic stuff. I find it bizare that many men cannot pick it up though i have known many women for who such concepts are equally as bizare.

It should just be part of everyone's own routines to do such things. Not just part of a woman's checklist for potential partners.","Because there's only two kinds of men - those that entirely suck and those that are entirely good, and things never ever change with time and between situations.

186,I absolutely agree with you.,"That’s part of the problem - if women communicate that they are unhappy with the amount of housework their SO is doing - they’re often seen as ‘nagging wives’

On top of that, it’s still work to have to remind your SO to do basic chores. You shouldn’t have to communicate - clean up your own dishes - because that should be something he already does. Yet it’s still seen as “women are so mysterious and expect you to read their minds” when they just want you to do the basics without having to remind you every time.

She said it’s not safe. She said we know it destroys their brains.”",Who the hell are the RFK and how do we end them?,"The bigger a company is, the less likely that there's a ridiculous conspiracy that nobody has leaked. 

But RFK says the CDC is lying to us about thimerosol melting kid's brains, so that one schmuck over there trying to sell his shots must be telling the truth while the entire CDC and big pharma is lying.

What is wrong in people's brains that they believe this crap? Must be all the thimerosol mercury damage from the vaccines we got as a kid. :P

And yes, I know that junk isn't even in shots anymore, but RFK doesn't!","Worse. He did painful test such as lumbar punctures on autistic kids knowing that he was going to falsify their data anyway. 

The most ironic thing for me is that there's usually a huge ""big pharma"" conspiracy about bringing him down. He actively falsified data to increase sales of his own vaccine. Therefore there is a ""big pharma"" conspiracy. Just against him and he got found out. Yet because it questions anti-vaxxxers beliefs then it can't possibly be true. ","Didn't know that last bit. What a bloody con man. The whole 'study' was just inaccurate as far as I can remember. 

Isn't there something about him not even using a control group of children who'd not been vaccinated, so basically he had nothing to compare his 'findings' to anyway? 


","Not only to be famous, Andrew Wakefield had a patent on an alternate MMR that was less effective.","Well worse as most of this antivaxxing crap came from a now debunked study by a doctor who more or less made shit up to be famous. I swear they should charge him with murder for every kid killed by his crap. I have 5 kids and you'd better believe they are all vacinated. 

That neighbor was a dumbass for not getting vaccinated and absolutely horrid human for being sick and watching a young one like that while sick herself.

253,"Snickerdoodle, those are all little kids. The oldest one is maybe, what, 13? 

I've had meltdowns like the last two videos as well. I made a comic about one of my triggers if you want to see it. I went to a segregated school for about two years and was in special ed for longer. At the segregated school they used restraints and isolation rooms and I can tell you outright they abused them to their fullest. They told our parents it was to ""calm the kids down"" but who the fuck calms down from being forcibly restrained?

 People grabbing their childrens face and restraining them and otherwise antagonizing them for the camera is basically never going to calm someone down when they're having a meltdown. 

There's a huge difference between a 5-year-old with ""~SEVERE~!"" autism and that same adult 20 years later, particularly if that adult isn't isolated and prevented from finding communication methods that work for them.

I mean my special ed teacher tried really hard to make sure I stayed in special ed as much as humanly possible. Any time I had a meltdown or a bad day at school she'd record it. And she'd show it at my IEP meetings. And she'd tell every staff member who interacted with me in the building. She wanted me in special ed for a minimum of 2 hours a day. I have no idea *why* but she did. And she could make me sound like I really had no ability to function at all...all she had to do was spend 3 years taking away every healthy coping mechanism I had (drawing, mild stimming, seating myself so sensory disorder wasn't as much of a problem in class, wearing sunglasses, etc) and antagonizing me and she created a profile that sounded like a very low functioning individual.

then I think of people like my younger brother, who is nonverbal and at one point had and used a speech aid until it was repeatedly taken away because he used it ""too much."" He won't use a similar aid to communicate now. I've found I can draw a flow-chart if I need to ask him something and that works, but imagine how much easier if people had decided they were just glad he was communicating than taking away his talker because he asked for cookies one too many times.

Never ever take those videos for granted that these people are just ""worse"" than you. There's a lot of context you're missing when you watch a 3-minute video of a kid having a meltdown.

266,In saving this reply better to it. Your comment means a great deal and makes me want to reflect on it. Just feel nauseated at the moment and think I need to throw up. I’ll respond soon. You just explained it perfectly. Thank you.,"Your whole family dynamic with your brother is breaking my heart in addition to you losing your father. I’m so sorry. You deserve people in your life who love and care about you, and I’m so sorry your brother has never healed from his trauma to love and care about you the way you deserve. I definitely recommend therapy. For your grief regarding your father and the fact your brother will never be the person you need and deserve. 

Also- I hit a very low point emotionally with COVID too. (I’m a psych nurse and we’ve had an outbreak in our locked unit). I posted on Facebook about it too in a vague “please wear a damn mask” way, because I’m fucking alone and sad too even though I’m happily married w kiddos. Covid has taken our normal relationships out of our lives. It’s very hard right now.","I’m glad you got mad and said that. I cried and screamed in my closet last night after he called my spouse and told me to take down my Twitter post. I was so upset and angry that he was controlling what I was posting on social media. My tweet was literally like, “My dad died at 6:08pm from COVID. Everything hurts. Please. Dad.” — He said.. “Tell her to take that shit down.” His words echo over and over.

Thank you for commenting. It feels relieving that I’m not alone in being upset over it. Thank you.",All good. I just got mad the way he treated you like that when grief stricken. Sending internet hugs.,"My spouse says the same thing. My brother is older than me by 16 years. Long story short - my dad was married and had his son. A decade and a half later, he met my mom and I was the “accident” child. He lived with us until I was 5, 6 years old. He moved back in with his first wife but they told me he just lived at work. I found out I had a brother and my dad lived with his first wife when I was 11 years old. Anyways, his first wife died when I was 16 and then my parents got back together when I was 17. They are 20 years apart. It’s a weird and strange story to explain but for the last 16 years they have been so happy together. My mom is in isolation right now and completely heartbroken.

I started to ramble - sorry.

I know my brother takes advantage of things and even does it with my spouse (the wi-fi thing as an example). I just have never been close to him and as I got older, I started to do anything and everything to try and become part of his family. When I worked at Disney, I would get them all into the parks. Or if the kids needed photos for graduation, birthdays, etc, he knew I had photography equipment made for weddings. I thought doing all of this stuff would help get us closer. But we are still not close and I honestly think he resents me. I know he does my mother. But I think he resents me too.","> he will come to us if he needs something

That's just another way to say he's a leech.","I know. I got upset when he called my spouse, telling him to, “Tell her to take that shit down right now.” I understand that he wanted me to remove it from Facebook because he didn’t want his kids to see when driving home from work, but I thought since my Twitter was private, it would be okay to turn there for help. My spouse is amazing and listens to me and allows me to vent, yes, but I just.. I was hoping to reach out to anyone across the internet to.. To talk to. I don’t know how to word it, but I think you know what I mean.

My spouse texted my brother after that phone call and tried to stand up for me. My brother is just the very - he has to be in control type. We are not close at all and typically he will come to us if he needs something. His wi-fi isn’t great at his new house or he wants to take the family to Orlando and needs a discount or to see if I had any hook ups (I’ve used hotel points for him multiple times before) or if my hospital has any entry level jobs for one of his kids. Stuff like that. So I probably should have known better than to post on social media. In the back of my head I knew I would get in trouble. 

I’m going to wait until the end of the weekend to post anywhere else. I’m just glad I could post here. It makes things feel less alone. I have a three year old and I have to compose myself as best as I can around him. He grasps some of what is going on.. but it’s hard to explain and for him to understand. So having this safe space and everyones kindness is amazing. Thank you again for reading and your time and everything. Thank you, thank you.","Your brothers behavior is heartbreaking, irresponsible, and downright cold. I'm really sorry, but he doesn't have the right to tell you to take your grief down. You have every right to feel what you feel and talk about it in any manner you need to. He put himself first, and that's sickening. Again, I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry for your loss. Please talk as much as you need to, and here's a virtual hug and an ear to listen."
267,That's not much different than telling a woman she has to be a mother because she got pregnant. Both sexes should have the right to chose whether or not they become legal parents,I didn’t say any such thing. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as there’s mutual consent. Just know that it is the woman’s decision to terminate and make your decision to come inside of her accordingly.,But isn't that just controlling people's sex lives by telling them what they can and cannot do in the bedroom?,What a colossal failure of imagination! There’s plenty of sex to be had without ejaculating inside of her.,"Isn't that the pro-life argument? ""Don't have sex if you dont want a kid""",If a man does not want a child then he should never ejaculate into a woman unless he is positive that she feels the same way.,"When there was a vote here for abortion (which was allowed) I thought it was wrong that people OUTSIDE the breeding age (say 45+) could vote. Its no longer their bloody business.

Nobody should be able to stop a woman from choosing to abort, or make trouble for her about it. Its a consequence that will be with her for the rest of her life.

On the same principle, I also believe that if a man does NOT want a child and the woman wants it, then he should be given an option to lose all rights and duties over it - it is equally unfair that a woman should be able to impose such a life-changing consequence upon a man when it is avoidable.","I use birth control because I have tumors growing inside and outside my uterus (Endo).

268,"Yep- And we wouldn't use the word ""ruined"" to describe bodies injured for non-birth related reasons. No reason to use it for this purpose- I know plenty of people who have found an increased sense of pride in their bodies post-childbirth- having managed to accomplish such a beautiful thing.","And often when people say a woman's body is ""ruined"" they're associating that ruin with our bodies being less sexually pleasing for others. Birth-related vaginal injuries are really awful and traumatic to experience, no doubt, but they do not make a woman's body ""ruined.""","Just supporting this- ""ruined"" is a really problematic word to use and makes a judgment on people's bodies prior to and after birth.","You're not wrong about that, but referring to it as ""ruined"" just plays into this bigoted idea that somehow women are past their prime after becoming mothers.","Not always, but sometimes. Some women die, some get PTSD, depression, life long effects. Fact is, it's a very risky, painful and often expensive procedure.","Our bodies aren't ""ruined"" after children... Definitely not the same, but not ruined.","As if they care about pregnancies, it's not their body that's ruined.","If a guy doesn't want to have sex with a condom because ""it doesn't feel good"", remind them what else doesn't feel good, STIs and unintended pregnancies."

Just because someone is on pain meds doesn't mean they're a shit person.,"Holy crap, that *is* unusual! Maybe there was a performance review going on while you were there. Regardless of the reason, you had the angels on your side that night.

My husband went in a year or so ago near unconscious, with no obvious cause. He had just been very tired at home, went for a nap, and then was mostly unresponsive when I tried to wake him up. They were sure he had inappropriately used medication at home (he had pain meds and muscle relaxers) no matter how many times I told them he had not and even though his tests came back showing NO drugs in his system. They put him in a room with instructions to the nurse to let him ""sleep it off"". When he started coming around many hours later, he was in terrible pain. As in, screaming, begging me and the nurses to kill him because he couldn't stand the pain, trying to climb over the bed rails, repeatedly passing out. The doctor had the nerve to come in and complain to us about the noise. I begged him, crying, to help and he said, ""He has pain meds at home. He can take them there."" I called another hospital and got them to agree to a transfer, but the original doctor refused to sign off on one. I eventually had someone bring me pain pills from my house, gave them to my husband and then, with two nurses helping me, dragged him to the car and took him home, where neighbors helped me get him into the house. 

He was OK by the next day. I have no idea what was going on, but the experience left us both scarred.",Yes,Was this in the U.S.?,right? its unbelievable how differently this could have turned out,[removed]

271,"As I said above, the idea that ALL Boomers were peace and love flower children and progressives was largely a fiction created through the nostalgic lens of the media.

On the other hand, younger generations aren’t a monolith either…as indicated by the alt-right. It’s foolish and shortsighted to ascribe all bad qualities to Boomers and all good qualities to younger generations.",The second time he was elected he carried 49 of 50 states. Someone besides Silents had to have voted for him. Not saying all Boomers but progressives could not have gotten *that* drowned out.,"And that notion that once-progressive Boomers sold out and voted for Reagan is largely false. Most Reagan voters were members of the “Silent Generation”….i.e., parents of Boomers. Also, people tend to think that all Boomers were once hippies and progressives during the 60s and 70s because the media portrays them that way. But there were plenty of conservative Boomers even then. Most of those who were progressive back in the day continue to vote that way.","Right? It's like, who do you think started the women's rights and environmental movements? Granted, many Boomers gave up when they voted for Reagan but still...","Exactly. It's really lazy thinking to just blame all of our problems on ""Boomers."" I'm on the cusp of Gen X and Boomer, and I know a lot of progressive Boomers.

Many of the wackos we see today are Gen X (MTG, Ted Cruz) or even Millennials (Madison Cawthorn; he's edging towards Gen Z).

This lumping all ""Boomers"" together is getting ridiculous and, frankly, dangerous. Ignore the younger generation of psychos at your own peril.","Boomer conservatives would do anything to go back to the all-white, wife-beating, 1950's nuclear family, where women and minorities have zero power over the blue-collared white man, and they didn't have to think about ""scary"" ideas they didn't understand."

You do not win any prizes from your local insurance company for being considered an alive human. Maybe a spam marketing mail. That's it.

(Unless the law expressly prohibits discrimination against a certain kind of customer, the insurance company can deny whomever, and they will tend to do that for risky categories of people, such as newborn babies or the already terminally ill.)","Holy shit people don’t understand.  If I want life insurance for my baby, it shouldn’t matter if it lives 14 days or not, based on the abortion law that just went defining the baby after 6 weeks of conception.

End of story.","The insurance company is not trying to define when the ""fetus"" became a ""baby.""

Insurance policies are legal contracts, with very clear terms. The insurance company writes up _a contract_ to pay out only if the baby survives the entire 14 day period starting at birth. The insurance company cares zero whether that human is called a baby, a fetus, whatever. It is not eligible for a claim on the policy unless it lives 14 days after birth. End of story. Calling it a baby or not, is 100% irrelevant to that clearly stated provision of the contract.","Yes, but if it is a baby 6 weeks after conception, it cannot not be a baby after that and then become a baby again 14 days after birth.","sorry for the following semantics.. but IF it is considered a baby a 6 weeks after conception... then it CAN also be a baby at 14 days after birth... so... it can be both... I guess all you need to amend would be to add is ""begins being considered"" before ""a baby"" and then the sentiment hold.... again... sorry for the semantics... i couldn't help myself.  


That said - Fuck the Texas law. Its complete bullshit.","I think they're making the point that you can't have it both ways. It's either a baby at 6 weeks after conception, or at 14 days after birth, but it can't be both.

Edit: it has been pointed out that it can be both if it's considered a baby at 6 weeks after conception which is obviously true. However, the law will consider both to be acceptable points at which the baby starts being a valid human, depending on the context.","It was 14 days after birth. 
I do know people who have been lobbying to change this, after their babies died before that 14 day window.",Wow this is disgusting. So is it a baby six weeks after conception or 14 days after birth? It sounds like the system is set up to fuck us over or something /s

287,"Uhm, well, as of late I don't initiate anymore (that way there's no rejection) and I let her take care of that.

We reached the lowest point around my bday (march), when were were having sex once or twice a month, at best. After we had numerous talks, it's been back to anywhere between 1 and 3 times a week.

Ideally, for me it'd be on a daily basis, even more than once per day, but I've come to terms that I'm just not going to get that, and that it's not sustainable in the long term, so I try to be happy with twice a week I guess, but I keep initiation to a minimum (that way I rule out duty sex too)",That’s so sad. How often would you say you’re getting rejected?,"I don't think I've mentally checked out, as I often enjoy many activities that I share with her on a daily basis and I still feel very much in love. The fact that something in particular doesn't make me happy right now doesn't mean I shouldn't try to fight for it and make it better. 

I understand that life's too short and all that jazz, but I guess I'm somewhat old fashioned and I enjoy working hard for what I get rather than ""deserving"" someone else.

If, in the future, after I've exhausted every avenue in my control (getting fit, counselling, etc), and I feel that she's not putting in any effort on improving, then I'll be oficially checked out. However, that's not the case at the moment.",Sounds like you’re already mentally checked out. Have you brought this issue up with her?

Sadly, I'm all she has in the world right now, and I'm deeply in love with her despite the lack of satisfaction in 'certain areas' of the relationship. Maybe if/once she recovers from her depression and past traumas things will get better (unlikely, I know), or maybe they stay the same or worse, only time will tell.",I mean we don't need to get into your whole relationship but life is too short for settle for someone you aren't compatible with whether it be sexuality or otherwise,"It's not hyperbole, I've convinced myself it's a sex drive mismatch.

I'm so sorry.,Yep. He also lied on his tax forms. He was (and I'm assuming still is) extremely entitled. One of my aunts straight up told me he didn't belong in prison because he came from a good educated family like... he ESPECIALLY deserves to be in prison because he had all of the advantages in life and still fucked it up if you ask me. I guess entitlement runs in the family.,Sounds like he was just utterly entitled and believed the world belonged to him and he could do whatever he wanted because he's so amazing. Yeah he should be shot in the head.,"His childhood was blessed. He was born into an upper middle class family with loving parents who doted on him, sisters who adored him, and a brother he could look up to. There was no drinking or substance abuse in the family. He was never even spanked. He went on to get several degrees and have a relatively successful career (except that he kept quitting jobs, but he got new jobs easily because of his credentials and charm). Some people are just bad eggs.  


edit: like seriously, he had every advantage in life. He went to a private school. He had all of the sports and music lessons he wanted. And even with all of that he chose to be a piece of shit who molested his students, his children, and the neighbors.",That's crazy. My initial feeling is that he shot be drug out into an alley and shot in the head. But I also wonder what would drive a person to do that. What was his childhood like? I'm so sorry you and your family endured that. What a tyrant.,"Yes. He is in prison now for what he did to me, my sister, and kids in our neighborhood. My sister talked to the DA but wouldn't testify in court because he and our family basically intimidated her out of doing so. She has a learning disability because her mom drank while pregnant so she's easily swayed. The only kid in the family who didn't get molested was my second sister and that's only because she lived with our mom. Yet, even though my dad sexually abused and beat everyone in the family who was weaker than him, they all stood by him. Especially my aunts."
290,Everyone's different I suppose. Personally I don't think I could forgive them either.,"I've never needed to forgive someone in order to ""move on."" I've always been fine with not forgiving them, with knowing they are a piece of shit and that's why they did the horrible thing. Piece of shit people do piece of shit things. Unfortunately, there's a lot of terrible people out there. A lot.","I think possibly a person could be driven to forgive because the alternative is to never forgive and be driven insane by dreams of revenge, or ""why did this happen"", or other things. Forgiveness could be something a person needs to do for their own sanity, regardless of whether forgiveness is 'fair'. 

I agree with you though, it's not my thoughts that matter here but I feel the person in this situation should be locked up like the animal they are. In these cases I think, ""would I happy if this person lived next door?"" In this case, absolutely not.","Yea I don't want to tell the OP how they should feel, but to be honest with you this is one of the more brutal rape stories I've read an account of from the actual victim. I could see maybe forgiving the friend who sexually molests you while blackout drunk. It's supremely fucked up but if they were drunk too I could maybe see why you might find it in you to forgive (even if I wouldn't). But this was beyond disgusting, it was astonishingly brutal.","Yeahhhhhh there are some people that really cant come back from the worst thing they have ever done. OP's rapist analy raped her, beat her, and kicked her stomach causing her to miscarry her 5 month pregnancy. The utter brutality of the attack leads me to believe that she is lucky to be alive, and that he has absolutely done this before.","> ""we are all more than just the worst thing we've done""

Apply that to Ted Bundy.","It sounds a lot like something Bryan Stevenson, founder of the equal justice initiative has said. I can't recall exactly but he said something like ""we are all more than just the worst thing we've done""","""I do not believe people should be defined by the worst moment of their life""

That sentence really stuck out to me. That sentence can humble a person. Thank you so much for sharing. You're incredibly strong."

I’m not sure how you process, but if you want support from a group who has gone through the same sort of religious abuse, try the sub edenexodus. They also have a podcast that I’ve found helpful as I process and heal, so maybe it would help you too. 

You are such a wonderful mom, and I have huge respect for the way you’re protecting your kids. Love and hugs x
I wish I could do more, but you’re welcome to DM me if there’s any way I can support you.","They are fundamental Baptist, and demon possession seems to be the go-to excuse for anything not in line with their unreasonably (in my opinion) hard religious rules they follow. There is no real personal responsibility.","Not heard about the demonic possession (not from US) but the ""hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil"" is recurring theme for many abuse stories alongside with punishing whistleblowers. Alongside with trivialization, victim blaming (stories about children 'tempting' poor priests 🤮, explanation of children enraging parents and 'forcing' them to discipline them etc.). It happens over and over in child abuse, sexual harassment (see #metoo) etc. I wouldn't be surprised if MIL told your daughter that your daughter will get into trouble if she tell you something.","Is this seriously a thing? I don't even know for sure but it never even crossed mind not to believe my child. How could anyone not 100% support their child over an abusive adult!? I guess somewhere inside I know it happens, I just can't wrap my head around it. My kids are always my first priority. Eff every one else.",Sounds sadly typical.,"When the two siblings came forward with allegations as teenagers, they disclosed to their youth pastor. Their father, the youth pastor, and the Senior pastor of the church all were dismissive of the allegations, went so far as to tell the kids they should recant and say they only made allegations because of demonic influences, and then it was all swept under the rug via a strict ""we just don't talk about this"" policy. That's why no charges were pressed at the time, and now the statute of limitations has expired. So I could see some merit to what you're saying given how that was handled.",">Like, I'm seriously trying to think of any way I can justify or defend this. Make it make sense.

I will preface that you need to, of course, do what is best for your children.

As for your husband - I will note that it sounds like he grow up in abusive household and might have been abused himself. He might not remember/believe and not want to remember/believe which is why he forgot to mention it to you - I was abused, though not sexually and not by my parents, in this age and I just remember flashbacks. If my parents tried to convince me that it didn't happened instead of being livid at perpetrator/sorry that it happened they probably could.

I don't know what you should do but I can understand your husband. This is not the same as excuse but it sounds like he needs therapy to come to terms with his childhood. Weather or not you and your children should be there in meantime is another matter.

I'm really sorry for what your daughter and you need to live through. I second u/raaahhhhhh about child abuse therapy."

300,God bless you.,You have us. Everyone in this thread is here to support you 100%!,I have no circle. I have no one. That's part of what makes this so unbearably difficult.,"you don’t have to make any decisions right now, but I would insist that your husband go into therapy immediately. whether his silence was from his own trauma or a willfull act of omission, he needs to get to the bottom of it- for you, your children (that he will be tied to if you divorce or not), for any future children he might have if y’all get divorced and for himself. I’m sure the psychologist working with your daughter can make a referral.

I grieve for what that monster did to your daughter and for you. I hope you have a circle of people who can care for you while you protect your daughter.",Is this a thing you can do?

301,I’m genuinely really sorry that you have that unfortunate knowledge. Good luck and I’m sure whatever you decide will be what’s best for your daughter.,The reason I was a single mom was because my children and I were domestic violence victims. I am unfortunately very well versed in filing all of the appropriate police reports and medical evaluations and keep a safe file in a safety deposit box with all of my forms and papers. This is how their biological father has no parental rights.,Agree it’s definitely possible he repressed trauma or was taught to normalize it. Therapy stat to talk this out. I’d also file a police report on this.  It may be enough with her pay history to keep her from unsupervised visits.,"I have to disagree with who you responded to. I was abused myself and abuse can effect memory in weird ways. If your husband never dealt with his own trauma, well that might be why he doesn’t understand the gravity of this omission.",I so desperately want there to be some valid explanation.,All I can say is there's no way he forgot. He had to have intentionally withheld this information.,"Like, I'm seriously trying to think of any way I can justify or defend this. Make it make sense. But I can't. I have nothing.

I'd like to think hes mocking trump with a look what you cant do",He'll try to pull a Putin and pass a lifetime immunity for former presidents before he leaves office.,"To be fair, Trump is likely to get indicted for crimes from before his presidency.

You know what's scary? Even if Trump leaves office (which looks more and more likely, unless SCOTUS selects him)... we are living amongst about half the country, who looked at everything he's done the past 4 years and thought, ""Hey, let's vote for more of that"". OMG!",Trump is EVERYONE’S problem but definitely caused by white people. 😩😩,"I don't understand it. My husband is Black and he doesn't get it either. He has Black friends in OH (where he's from originally) who are hardcore Trumpers.  


The only thing I can think is that Kamala had a pretty poor record in regards to men of color when she was a prosecutor.  I know that hurt her with leftists (it's why I didn't vote for her in the primaries).  I haven't heard it discussed as being a major driver, though? 


But all in all, I think Trump got 4% of the Black male vote in 2016 and 8% this year, so in reality, as per usual, Trump is largely a white people problem.",Totally agree. And while polls are not so accurate I read the numbers of black men supporting trump rose significantly.

308,"Thanks for thinking that :)

Context: We talked a bit while hanging out with a mutual friend. Afterwards she found me on facebook, asked if I had anything to do on sunday (ex had broken up with me the day before) and so I said, not really, we could meet up. We talked a bit and I had a looming feeling she didn't ask to meet me bcz she wanted to be just friends, and I was kinda lonely, so I asked that.

Now happily in a relationship since two months. :p",I think that's super romantic and would have loved to be asked like that!,"Sure is.

Then again I am on the autistic spectrum so talking straight is my mojo. Yes, I do have a vested interest in all this.","It's definitely happening more now as compared to, say, 50 years ago.","Yeah. In general it would help a ton that we remove the 'playing games' from romance altogether.

A monumental cultural change is needed for that. I shall hope it happens in my lifetime.","it would be nice if the 'moral majority' stopped telling girls to just say no. If we tell girls to say no when they want to say yes, then tell men to just try harder when they get told no ,  you promote sexual coercion. We should not be teaching men that when a woman says no she doesn't mean it, and we need girls to stop playing games that play into that scenario.",Would be nice if the ''hard-to-get'' stereotype just vanished into thin air.,Definitely. Add to that that too many women say 'no...' but actually mean that they want you to put in more effort in pursuing them. The self-aware or insecure guys then tend to play it safe and assume she indeed means no. The impetuous guys then keep pushing and only stop after several no's.
309,"I’m a really tall dude (204cm) and people in school were always trying to convince me to pick up someone else who’s on the smaller side.

Edit: the awards! I don't have a speech prepared!","I took a self defense class once and was literally told sometimes you have to ""take the rape"" to get out safely.   It was described as a tool of self defense.  I am really surprised how often men don't understand the reality of these situations.","Having taken a self defense course, specifically for women and in an urban area we were taught in that course that compliance and surrender are also forms of self defense.   This makes me so mad that people can't figure this out.  

You are alone with someone who has obviously no qualms about hurting you or taking what they want by force.  Could I fight? Sure! Is it the best option? Only the person in that situation gets to decide.  

Anyone who has had to physically fight off aggressors (bigger than you) can probably attest to how terrifying and exhausting it is.  That's the truly scary part.

It just sucks that someone will have to get assaulted to stop them.","What happens next time, or the time after that?","While I agree with you, in theory, that they should have the consequences thrown upon them, they only face consequences after committing an act of violence. In this case likely sexual assault.

It's still better that the one good guy stopped it before it happened.","No, let the groups of shitty people face consequences for their behavior instead of making one good person save them from themselves.

That might be the problem then.

For the most part, in a large portion of Western countries, the major battles have been won if you look at things objectively. 

-Women outperform men in school.

-Women under the age of 30 are typically paid more then men, showing that any earning gap that did exist is quickly closing.

-Men are more likely to be victims of violent crime.

-Men are equally as likely to be victims of domestic abuse.

-Men are equally likely to be raped. 

-Women are likely to be issued reduced sentences compared to a man in the event they commit a crime. 

-Women are overwhelmingly favoured by the courts in custody battles.

-Men are more likely to commit suicide.

-Men are more likely to be homeless.

-Women have far greater access to resources if they are homeless, victims of violence, etc. 

-Men are 90%+ of workplace fatalities/injuries.

So, when both sexes face fairly equal amounts of hardship, the feminist movement (in the West) has had to move on and focus on things that can arguably be considered ""grasping"" for a problem. 

Now, that being said, women in the west do still face hardships that men don't (Abortion and Birth control access being the main one). However, it can easily be argued that men face plenty of hardships that women don't (see my list above). 

This is probably why fewer and fewer ""centrist"" people consider themselves feminists anymore in the West and are beginning to embrace the egalitarian and humanist movements/identities.
","There seems to be a major misinterpretation of my comment/post, although I'm sorry if I did not elaborate further.


There are two major points to clarify: 


Firstly, I did not write the original post to say ""Please, West, *interfere* in our causes"". I never implied or mentioned that anywhere. Where did you get that from? I wrote this in a genuine effort for dialogue and promoting understanding about your perspective because of the disconnect between the South/North. I'm genuinely trying to understand how these causes are considered revolutionary,  because they seem to have strong media presence.  Infact, when I said: 
>It is just extremely difficult to comprehend how these issues are considered revolutionary when there are much more deeply rooted problems, particularly economic and political, that should be at the forefront?


I was trying to understand why and how these causes are powerful when compared to challenges such as female poverty, equal opportunity, domestic violence, rape, lack of political power and so on. From my understanding, despite the progress on these issues, they are still widespread and deeply-rooted in many Western countries. The fight for these is what symbolizes the fight for women, in my opinion. 



Secondly, when I say foreign intervention, I mean when it is foreign governments and men trying to impose their own agenda on us, in the guise of ""advancing women's rights"". That has been our experience - it has not been good. I cherish and appreciate solidarity and compassion from fellow women across the globe, but foreign intervention/influence has been intertwined and tainted with political agendas. ","> Though, I do not support outsider influence.

328,"What the fuck I had no idea about any of this, i feel like I just read an episode of Black Mirror. God this is a weird century.","There is a phenomenon that has been developing recently called being a VTuber. This is when a streamer on the internet uses an animated avatar that follows their movement and facial expressions in real time. It allows streamers to perform without worrying about their personal attractiveness and keep other aspects of their personal life private. It also facilitates roleplaying as a character, which is a good fallback for making mild jokes and memes, and creates some interesting variety in streaming content. Finally, it subconsciously encourages viewers to participate more directly with the community and the character - for example, drawing a short comic about an imagined situation involving 2 real-life webcam streamers would be really creepy, but drawing the same kind of comic with two VTubers as characters seems relatively normal, since you're only ""taking control"" of them as characters rather than as real people. Because of this, VTuber communities tend to encourage a *lot* of interaction from their viewerships - for example, many of the bigger VTubers have enough fanart made of them that they can use freely-given, high quality art of their characters made by people in their communities for their Youtube stream thumbnails every day.

There are many, *many* VTubers nowadays: the cost of getting a decent custom Live2d avatar made for yourself has gone down in recent years, to the point that it's now in the same ballpark as a good streaming PC or other equipment, and the experience of being a VTuber is pretty much categorically better than being a real-life streamer in pretty much every regard. The audiences are much more positive and supportive, it's easier to be engaging as a performer when you can integrate little bits of character roleplay, and there's less pressure and entanglement with your real life. Becoming a VTuber in 2021 is an aspiration similar to ""becoming a streamer"" in 2015. However, since it's a very competitive market, many VTubers find it difficult to achieve the level of success that they're looking for on their own, so most of them opt to join a *management agency*, who handles a wide range of behind-the-scenes stuff for them and allows them to simply focus on streaming and making content (for a cut of their profits).

Hololive is the biggest agency known to western viewers, and the second biggest in Japan (where all this originated). Their viewership really exploded in 2020. They now have several individual streamers with over 1 million subscribers each, and the more popular ones regularly exceed 20,000-30,000 concurrent viewers during normal gaming streams. Special events and debut streams can sometimes exceed 100,000 concurrent viewers. They achieved popularity through a few key factors:

1. Although their streamers all have various individual character roleplays, as a company they all have a focus on *being an idol*. This is the Japanese sense of the word ""idol"", which has some nuances to it that don't translate perfectly to an American audience, but if you think roughly Britney Spears but a bit more modest and with more of a focus on being friendly and ""pure"", you kind of get the idea. Anyway, this focus on being idols gives the entire company a strong sense of drive and the impression of being ambitious underdogs, which makes people want to support them, watch them grow, and celebrate every new opportunity they achieve.
2. All of the streamers are on very good terms with each other, and ""collab"" (do streams with each other) very often. This is very effective cross-advertisement, which encourages their individual viewers to become fans of the entire company, and it also gives their streams a great sense of friendliness and variety. This may be especially appealing to viewers who are lonely and/or socially awkward, since it feels like getting to participate in a conversation between friends. Some of the streamers like each other enough to wholeheartedly roleplay as being ""interested"" in each other, and a few have voluntarily become roommates in real life.
3. They happened to hire 2 streamers with particularly strong English skills, who helped build a bridge to English viewers, and eventually laid the groundwork for the company being able to launch a full English branch, which has been incredibly successful.
4. Their communities are self-perpetuating because of the effort and involvement of viewers. As I explained before, the nature of these streamers really encourages viewers to invest their own creative skills into the community; the more this happens, and those high-quality creative works are recognized and signal boosted by the streamer, the more exciting and entertaining it becomes to be a viewer of that community, which in turn draws in more viewers, many of which are talented creators as well, and the cycle continues.
5. Hololive in particular seems to have a knack for hiring very kind, genuine people. If you look up and down the Hololive roster, you won't find a single person who's causing drama, being snarky or passive aggressive, acting jealously, etc. They try to create a supportive, harmonious environment for each other, and serve as role models for their viewers. This is a really attractive form of escapism for people fed up with the cynical, cut-throat society they experience in real life.

Now, the bad side: because it's founded on Japanese ""idol"" culture, Hololive is pervaded with the inherent misogyny of that system. All of the main Hololive streamers are women (there's a separate branch for men that is roughly 1/10 as popular), and their entire business model relies on the type of parasocial relationship that an attractive, charismatic woman can form with a horde of lonely male fans. A great deal of Hololive's income comes from Superchats - stream donations through Youtube - that are given by lonely audience members who just want a bit of attention, or want to feel a bit appreciated by the streamer because of their money. Of the top 12 highest Superchatted Youtube channels in the world, 11 are Hololive streamers, and two of them have earned over $2 million in total donations, in less than 2 years. 

And because of this, to play to their audiences, many of the streamers often rely on jokes and fanservice that you'd think of as intolerably exploitative if it was dialogue written by someone else rather than improv by the streamers themselves - lots of teasing about the size of boobs, questions about the color of panties they're wearing, that kind of thing. And to wrap all that up in a bow, a large confluence of factors - from the friendly, non-critical, non-confrontational vibe that the streamers try to effect in their streams, to the unrelenting competition of viewership and donation numbers, to the company's underlying ownership and control of the streamers' *very identities* - means that it's very likely that any points of discomfort or disagreement between the performers, their management, and the demands/expectations of their viewers will just be swept under the rug and never addressed publicly.

There have been some scandals too. One talent was stalked and sexually harassed by her manager - the company eventually took her side and helped her with legal fees and relocation, but only after it appeared like they were trying to bury the issue for a while. Another talent was the victim of a horrible, targeted harassment campaign by Japanese fans right after she debuted, because she was seen as a ""troublemaker"" or not ""pure"" enough to be an idol, to the point where she resigned in disgrace. What's more, although that person's life was nearly destroyed in the process, it's *strictly not allowed* for anyone in the Hololive community - streamers or viewers - to talk about her or what she's been doing since she left the company (ostensibly, this rule is to protect her privacy, but it also serves to protect the company's interests of severely discouraging anyone from trying to maintain their internet popularity after abandoning their company character).

So, in the end, is it a good or bad thing? Is it misogynistic or empowering? Is it perpetuating the traditionally very exploitative idol culture in Japan, or revolutionizing it? Is it providing comfort to lonely people, or validating their problematic fetishization of Japanese culture and parasocial female attention?

Personally, I think it's positive overall. But I'm also solidly part of the lonely male demographic they're intentionally pandering to, so who knows.

Edit: Oh also, it doesn't really have anything to do with ""anime"" per se. There just happens to be a very high correlation in their fan bases because VTuber avatars use the same art style, and fans of anime tend to be fans of Japanese VTubers for a number of reasons.

And to wrap all that up in a bow, a large confluence of factors - from the friendly, non-critical, non-confrontational vibe that the streamers try to effect in their streams, to the unrelenting competition of viewership and donation numbers, to the company's underlying ownership and control of the streamers' *very identities* - means that it's very likely that any points of discomfort or disagreement between the performers, their management, and the demands/expectations of their viewers will just be swept under the rug and never addressed publicly.

There have been some scandals too. One talent was stalked and sexually harassed by her manager - the company eventually took her side and helped her with legal fees and relocation, but only after it appeared like they were trying to bury the issue for a while. Another talent was the victim of a horrible, targeted harassment campaign by Japanese fans right after she debuted, because she was seen as a ""troublemaker"" or not ""pure"" enough to be an idol, to the point where she resigned in disgrace. What's more, although that person's life was nearly destroyed in the process, it's *strictly not allowed* for anyone in the Hololive community - streamers or viewers - to talk about her or what she's been doing since she left the company (ostensibly, this rule is to protect her privacy, but it also serves to protect the company's interests of severely discouraging anyone from trying to maintain their internet popularity after abandoning their company character).

So, in the end, is it a good or bad thing? Is it misogynistic or empowering? Is it perpetuating the traditionally very exploitative idol culture in Japan, or revolutionizing it? Is it providing comfort to lonely people, or validating their problematic fetishization of Japanese culture and parasocial female attention?

Personally, I think it's positive overall. But I'm also solidly part of the lonely male demographic they're intentionally pandering to, so who knows.

Edit: Oh also, it doesn't really have anything to do with ""anime"" per se. There just happens to be a very high correlation in their fan bases because VTuber avatars use the same art style, and fans of anime tend to be fans of Japanese VTubers for a number of reasons. But they're two different industries, really. Like I said before, Hololive has much more to do with Japanese idol culture rather than Japanese animation.","Can you explain Hololive to me?

340,"Kyoto Animation is a studio that was originally founded by women doing the grunt work of animation, mainly outsourcing for other ""proper"" studios and slowly worked their way into being a proper studio animating their own stuff in-house. Close to 80% of the workers are still women, and they have made some of the most well known, memorable works in anime. Most of their stuff does a pretty good job of portraying girls and women well. Violet Evergarden is probably one of their best works.

I think there are a lot of studios out there that avoid some of the more problematic issues. It's just cheaper to crank out trash tier series, and there's a massive oversaturation of series these days in the hopes that one will hit gold.","Some is fine imo.

They're made as fantasy escapism for certain type of demographics but you wouldn't hate all books just because 50 shades sold millions. 

The problem with anime is part of their society. Japan in general still have problems with sexism and that end up being reflected in their media.

347,"Just pointing out a response to the birth control failure argument for abortion. I went to a Texan high school that heavily emphasized abstinence-only sex ed and there was definitely implied slut-shaming.

Lol,> then you shouldn't have had sex in the first place (you slut),"I edited my comment to reflect what I meant, so to take out the obliterate comment. 

You are correct about the cheap, easy and effective birth control. However, I challenge you to find one that is 100% effective (Except for getting a hysterectomy). Shit happens, birth control fails, condoms fail.","How do you obliterate this argument? There are many cheap, easy and effective forms of birth control available and  not getting pregnant is very easy to do. You literally have to do nothing.

That's my favorite one to talk when debating this with certain people. (I rarely all out fight people about this, I hate conflict)

Edit: I guess I shouldn't have said obliterate, to be honest. Because I can think my points are valid all I want, but usually when I'm debating with someone on abortion, they are so dead set in their ways there is no reasoning with them.","In short, should the rights of a non-viable fetus hold more weight than that of the mother who would be forced ~~to carry it to viability~~ raise the child until approximately age 20 when they don't have the necessary resources (money)?

","The issue is whose rights supersede the others - the woman or the fetus? It then delves into a philosophical and scientific question about whether a fetus is considered “human” or not. Roe v Wade determined, based on science, that it is not until it reaches the stage of viability. Medical advancements have started to shift the goalposts on viability, though it’s still in contention (ie more states are able to pass restrictions after 20 weeks - though the survival rate of a fetus is extremely low, not to mention many tests that determine abnormalities or severe defects aren’t able to be performed until that time which is why you see a push to protect the rights and leave the decision up to the mother and doctor). 
In short, should the rights of a non-viable fetus hold more weight than that of the mother who would be forced to carry it to viability? "

I don't know if you have posted about this before, but there are women smarter and more informed than I who could also give you advice. I can feel how stuck,  sad, and defeated you feel. I also hear a spark in your voice that is still fighting!

I wish there were some way for him to go to jail for awhile. Just to give you enough time to get away. 

I'm so incredibly sorry. You didn't deserve this. None of the victims of abuse do. You were honest and vulnerable because you wanted to believe in the good in people. I don't know why some people have a radar for good people, vulnerable people, or people who haven't figured out how to set boundaries-- and exploit them. I don't know how anyone could be so calculating. It's sick.","TL;DR: I think it was the way that he was always the injured party. Like now I know he was the perpetrator of abuse for his relationships and also the other woman he had as a roommate. Beware of dudes who seem too kind right off the bat. Too helpful. Sounds crazy, I know. 

When I met him, I had just been assaulted. I talked to him about how I didn’t have any family and how I was scared living in my apartment where the guy had stalked me. He knew I was isolated AND that I didn’t feel comfortable or okay after having to report my harassment, stalking, and assault. I was honest because I am an honest person and I wish I hadn’t told him how alone and vulnerable I was. 

He offered to help. He pretended to be kind. Now, I don’t trust myself or my judgement of people. I am not ME anymore. I feel so so broken. 

At one point, I realized how bad it was when I had to call the cops AGAIN a second time. I tried to leave and he tried to hurt me. I thought I could HELP him somehow. I can’t. 

If all his stories center around him being the one hurt by others and he seems really kind for no reason… It’s probably too good to be true. Real men admit their mistakes, flaws, and areas of growth.

Oh wait. He also called himself “an asshole.” I didn’t see it and I feel SO SO SO STUPID for thinking, “how can you be an asshole when you’re helping me find a new place to live to escape a bad situation?” Jokes on me. He WAS/IS an asshole and he knew I didn’t have anyone to protect me. 

He also asked me how much I made indirectly. Found out how much at work and somehow all my bills at his place totaled that amount. I have no money leftover to leave. He even borrowed money from me just to keep me here I’m pretty sure. 

It started with negging. Out of nowhere, a subtle put down. I told him to stop. He did. Picked up raising his voice around me… to yelling at me. Turned into looming over me without touching me. Flipping tables, throwing stuff, slamming stuff. “Accidentally” knocking me over. Being angry at me for existing, somehow. He didn’t want to be that way. Could I help him? Would I go with him to therapy to explain what I saw? Could I stay because he got fired from work to help with bills? Could I pay for… X, Y, Z and he’d “pay me back” later? Packing to leave, he lost it. Fucking lost it. Shook me like a rag doll and then later body slammed me to the ground. 

Some dude I thought would be safe to live with because he was so big and could *protect me* unlike living with another woman… Became my biggest nightmare. I’m never happy anymore. I hate my life. I wish I had just continued being stalked and assaulted. Living with it had systematically changed my whole identity and I hate who I am now. I don’t wish this on any other woman. I have it all documented for the police for when I leave. 

I’m terrified to leave until I have the money ready to get a place for myself/my dogs and my important stuff hidden away. I can’t leave them with him. I NEVER thought I would be in this position. I would have judged me for not leaving. I wouldn’t have understood how much physical danger it actually is, not being safe at home. How much danger it is even *thinking* about leaving, much less slowly planning an emergency escape. 

I’m not sure there are real warning signs until you start to hear things like “you’re overreacting,” “you’re crazy,” or “it was a joke!” Sometimes someone can seem normal for years and flip. If I could go back, I would have started planning my escape sooner.",That’s a really good point like a crab in water. What warning signs would you tell someone to look out for?,"I’m living with someone like this and I couldn’t listen to it all either. I wanted to watch it all because I feel like it’s important for us to support one another but it was too hard. 

I hate that she hasn’t been able to leave yet. I kept thinking about the boiling pot/frog analogy and I know exactly how she got there. No one ever thinks it could happen to them until it does. I just hope, hope, hope she gets the support she needs so she and her animals can leave. 

There are so few domestic violence shelters that accept pets. I bet one of the reasons she hasn’t left is because he keeps threatening her dogs. I hate abusive people. I wish there was something we could do for her.",Ahh!! Thanks for letting me know about this form of abuse. I definitely was exhausted just listening.,"I can't recall the specific terms but abusers apparently do this in order to intentionally cause mental exhaustion so that their victim is more malleable 

It's hard to defend yourself or feel safe or able to leave when this is constant. And then I'm sure he will love bomb her too afterward so that the drastic shift from awful to perfect disarms her further. 

My heart breaks that she has had to deal with even a moment of this guy","Damn this is waaaayyy too complicated. If someone is playing all of these mind games, it’s time to leave. 

He was annoying the shit out of me with all the yelling, double-talk, circuitous talk, blaming…no one deserves to live like that. I just tuned him out after awhile…I can see why she would too. “Wahwahwahwah” Yeah go fuck yourself buddy."

Peace to you and yours and best wishes on your family!","Thank you for your concern, and I'm so happy you're healing from that experience. I'm so sorry that happened.

worse before they got better, but with a lot of hard work I eventually finished my nursing diploma. I work in Pediatrics and I'm presently working on upgrading my education to my RN.

I haven't had a panic attack at home since moving in with him and we discussed having babies in the near future yesterday!","Do you have people in your life that support you emotionally now? I read your post and really want to encourage you. You deserve a good life with real friends that have honest and pure love for you. 

You are worthy of good things. I hope you are in a place in life where you are the only one deciding whom to invite into your personal space. 

I wish you every happiness that life has available.

Sex work was the only option I had when I started, I was facing homelessness and I had tried everything else. (2008 economic crash, I had two jobs: a cook and a call canter employee. Both businesses went under in the same month and I spent the next three looking for work without any luck while maxing out my credit cards on groceries and defaulting on rent.) So yes, I ""wanted to,"" and I willingly took a job as an escort (first with an agency and later independently) because the alternative was worse. There were definite benefits, like making the amount I used to earn in 70 hours in one night. I wanted to be able to focus on school and be food secure, as much as it was terrible for me. I'd never actually slept with a man before that night. I wanted sex to be for the people I loved, but the world doesn't always let you live your ideals. I planned to do the minimum necessary to keep afloat financially and repay my debts. But I was blackmailed by my ex into doing it far more often, for much longer, and with people I would have declined as clients. She threatened to expose me to my school and my family. She controlled all the money, and instead of paying down debt she spent it on cocaine. And I fully believed no one would ever consider me as a partner if they knew I had done sex work, and I wouldn't build a relationship while hiding that information. So I thought it was staying in that situation or being alone forever. Things got really bad, and I was in some incredibly dangerous and traumatizing situations. I was raped. At that point I had other career options, and didn't want to be doing it any more. But I had no way out that I could see. There was one guy who heard my ex screaming at me from the car as I was sobbing and refusing to go. He heard her threats about what she would do to me if I didn't do it. And he saw how bruised I was. He gave me the money and asked me to leave. I'm so grateful to him, because he would have been completely justified in cancelling. But I think he knew that things would be much worse for me if I didn't get the money. 

TLDR; You can enter sex work consensually and still be exploited. Money is a factor in making decisions, and the pay for sex work might be the best choice for an individual, even if they hate it. We need to decrease the stigma surrounding sex work so that people aren't trapped by the threat of being exposed. There are definitely hundreds of men out there who did contribute indirectly to my abuse, but I don't blame them. There's one out there who made an ethical, selfless decision, and my gratitude to him has endured for more than a decade. If sex work hadn't been an option I would have been homeless at one point.

There is no good way to spot who is in it because they “want to be” and who is there because of bullshit like this.

Thanks for the tip about the water!","EMDR was a lifesaver for me when I was SA'd. It's definitely not easy, and I'd not recommended it if you still have a strong trauma response. If you start the process, take something to eat with you for after the session, because it made me very hungry. Also, be prepared to feel empty and a bit numb after your session. What helped for me was taking some time to go to a park afterwards and watch the rain on the water to calm my brain.

353,"Yes definitely. I don't know what the answer is either, but to me the glaring issue is also society's view on women. I don't think making sex work legal and regulated is going to change that and instead will only endanger more women since the root issue isn't being addressed by doing that. 


I hope we figure something out soon.","I think it all circles back to purity culture and objectifying women. Certain jobs may be legal, but they still have a negative reputation and are largely stigmatized by the general population. ""You're a model? That's so cool! Oh, you're an OnlyFans model? Slut."" ""You're a dancer? Wow, what kind, ballet? Stripping?! So you sell your body to strangers."" ""You're an actress in minor films?! That's awesome, what kind of films? Oh, porn?""

I don't know what the answer is, but as usual, nothing will change until society's view on women does, because a guy who has a lot of sex is a player, while a woman is a slut or a whore.","But there is already a lot of sex work that isn't illegal (like OF, stripping, porn) and it's still such a huge problem. I just don't see how further supporting this would change anything.","THIS! When sex work is decriminalized & made less stigmatized, it opens up ways for SWs to take legal action against clients who mistreat them.

354,"It's complicated.

Found that legalizing sex work increased human trafficking. The demand for sex workers outpaced the ability to supply it through legal means. Whether legalization actually decreases human trafficking (a claim made flippantly all the time) is far from a settled matter. It needs more research but what we have currently indicates the opposite. 

I did an analysis comparing the impacts of legalization, decriminalization and criminalization of sex work. All have their various pros and cons. And as others have already said even among the cohort who ""want to do it"" there's a lot of different reasons. Examples: I want to do it because it's the only way I can afford to eat. I want to do it because my boyfriend really wants me too. I want to do it because it's the only way I can get my heroin at a discount.

 Like the reasons for ""wanting to"" aren't always free of coercion or positive which is why ""choice feminism"" can be lacking in its refusal to analyze what influences people's choices.","But there is already a lot of sex work that isn't illegal (like OF, stripping, porn) and it's still such a huge problem.

355,"That would require her to not be a piece of shit.

I, and any other open-relationship people I know aren't there for you (not YOU, the general you) to lie and cheat.  We have rules too.  Rule 1: Don't be a piece of shit and fuck up a closed relationship.

She's just a cheating piece of shit.","Wow. In an open marriage situation, it seems like the ideal would be that the partners only see others who are similarly in open relationships, or unpartnered. 

This makes me wonder if she gets off on the sneaking/shame parts of cheating. That would have some explanatory power in relation to her being given permission by her husband to sleep around, but continuing to be a party to dishonesty and deception — including to her own friend.","Her husband already knows and seems to be as 'okay' with it as he possibly can be. I posted this below but I don't know that it's super visible:

They have an “open marriage.” Read: she cheated once before with her boss and her husband didn’t want to divorce so... they have this arrangement. I did not know this until after my husband passed, otherwise I definitely would’ve re-evaluated our friendship.","Yeah those kinda of people don't need you to be villainized they are already bad people.

I would tell her husband he doesn't deserve to have that done to him any more then her home wrecking you.  These kinda people make me sick. You didn't do anything wrong and don't let a thought that you did creep in. 

I hope you have better people in your life then that friend in the future.","Seriously, yes please. It takes a lot for me to get mad but I was furious after she gave ME a sob story that she couldn’t bear be villainized...for her own actions! Then blocked me so I couldn’t even express my anger!! There are no words.",Oh puke. Let me at her. Unbelievable.,"Thank you so much! This friend initially came to me trying to support me right after it happened and I clung to that. I don’t know why and I feel stupid for it now. I guess I just wanted to be close to people who were close with my husband in those final days (shock does weird things).

356,"Wow. In an open marriage situation, it seems like the ideal would be that the partners only see others who are similarly in open relationships, or unpartnered.

I'm amazed by your strength and resilience. I think one of the toughest parts of going through a hard time like this is that you don't get validation, and support is erratic.

If you can get ahold of Ginger People products (sold on Amazon and elsewhere), those are also fantastic. They have ginger juice and a bunch of different candies of varying intensity. Also excellent for motion sickness, btw.

Tomato soup (cheap-ass Campbell's condensed) and iced tea with lemon wedges will also do the trick. That little bit of acidity will often cut the nausea a little.

I also find myself turning lately to pho with lime squeezed in as a good, soothing remedy, for the same reason as the above. Get it delivered, or do up a pot yourself (I use Jet Tila's quick recipe and mod it to make it easier, so I don't have to go to the grocery--let me know if you want my mods).

Also, if it sounds good, try eating it. Your body may decide ""I can make this one thing work,"" so give it a shot. Make sure that you're getting *some* calories in (if all you can handle are milkshakes, well, sounds like you're drinking milkshakes) and are staying hydrated.

We're still paying on his truck. The mortgage. Credit cards. Tool payments. The bills from the baby haven't come yet. We're going to have bills from this. We have insurance but the copays and deductibles are high.

There is not much more they can do if he gets worse.

I can't replace my husband's $28 an hour job cashiering at Walmart. So, yeah, this is going to have serious ramifications.

We'll get a definitive diagnosis at the advanced neurology center early this week.","What you’re describing sounds very serious, and you might need to start calling in some help from friends and family. You mention in a response here that family lives far away, but this sounds like something that you may be unable to deal with on your own and you will need resources to help your husband, care for your new child, and come up with a long term plan for how to manage this. Sometimes you have choices to involve family members, and you’d rather not if they are far away, and sometimes you don’t because the issue is serious enough that they need to be there. This may be one of those times.

It sounds like your husband’s physicians have an idea what’s going on, but maybe haven’t made a final determination or disclosed their suspicions to you while they wait on testing. It might be beneficial for you to sit down with a neurologist one-on-one and make them explicitly spell out exactly what they think is going on with your husband, as well as the long-term ramifications and progression of his diagnosis. Make sure to ask them what the ramifications of a diagnosis might be on your husband’s work and life long term. This sounds very serious, and you are going to need all of the information available to make good choices. 

Some of the responders here are attributing the problems you describe to “lack of sleep” or other more minor and temporary issues. However, the symptoms and history you describe also bring up the possibility that this may be a more serious chronic health diagnosis. 

No one here can help you troubleshoot what is going on, as this will be something that needs to be done by your husband’s specialist physician—likely the neurologist. This is far above Reddit’s paygrade. 

I’m being repetitive, but I can’t stress the importance right now of cornering your husband’s medical team if you need to and making them tell you what’s going on. Bring a trusted friend or family member with you, record or take notes, and make them repeat things that don’t make sense. If this turns out to be minor, great, but if it’s not, you will want to know now so that you can plan instead of being blindsighted in the future. 

I don’t want to scare you, but I don’t want you to miss necessary information because you are unaware that people are treating you with kid gloves. Hopefully I’m wrong and that’s not the case."

If you're carrying anything in defense that could be construed to be a weapon - a knitting needle, for example - it's important that you **never** tell anyone it's to protect yourself.  That makes it a weapon.  *Using* a weapon in self defense is a right protected by the Charter, but being in possession of one is not.

More on topic, you *can* carry pepper spray intended to be used on animals.  But if you ever get stopped by the police and say ""I'm just terrified of being raped,"" then you have admitted to a crime.  I'm sure it's similar in some US states.

426,"Former Haligonian... I sometimes feel like the Atlantic Provinces are the ""rural area"" of Canada. With other resources (money and jobs) concentrated in other parts of the country, the East Coast loses out on essentials like doctors. When I lived in Halifax (for about 8 years, after moving from *actual* rural NS) I would have to travel the hour to my hometown to see ""my"" doctor because I couldn't find one in the City.

About 6 years ago I moved to a northern city. The population of this ""city"" is a fraction of Halifax, but because there are so many well paying jobs up here, it really draws people up. I haven't had any problem finding a doctor. Sure, there are fewer people here in general. But I would argue there's a greater concentration of doctors here. Especially young doctors recently out of school looking to pay off student loans. There's also a much shorter wait time of you go to the ER despite there only being one hospital. 

I don't think universal healthcare is the problem in Atlantic Canada... I think it's a combo of the aging population/ high student loans for young professionals/ lack of well paying jobs to pay off those student loans. ","I'm in an urban area.

428,"Oh ffs your misrepresenting the situation to the point you might as well be lying then. 

Halifax and the atlantic provinces in general has both an aging population and young  professionals not staying. This means that the number of new GPs in the province has not being going up, while the number of people who need access to GPs to manage chronic conditions has been going up. As well as current GPs retire, their patients need to find other primary care physicians. 

What this means is that the waiting list is not agnostic. People with chronic conditions who really need access to a primary care physician are getting placed on the list before you.

439,While laziness is definitely a factor (particularly when it comes to women) let's also not forget the horrific staffing and overwork issues in and around healthcare in general.

That was her 3rd time in the E.R as well. She didn't have insurance so getting into a specialist was a whole other challenge but I think after like the 6th E.R visit she finally got a recommendation.

Thankfully she's doing better now, after colon removal and a colostomy bag . It just makes me rage how complicated and sadistic this Healthcare system is.

And yeah, it's certainly been a shock/adjustment & my girlfriend has laughed hearing me complain about really minor sexism that is just utterly nonsensical but everyday stuff.  But honestly, it's also so individual.  Like I was about as privileged as I could've been - an attractive, muscly, white dude - so just the shift from someone who kinda comes off as a chad to someone who's thought of as cute/bubbly probably plays as much a factor as gender itself does.

I just made a friend in my new city who's a slim gay man a few years younger than me & it's been fascinating to talk to him because our experiences with masculinity/manhood are just so *wildly* different.","hahaha yeah but hearing it and living it is different, for example I would hear sexist stuff when I was a child but now I am an adult it hits with the ""oh so that was true and not a fairytale"".

I like contrapoints because she talks openly and in detail and honestly I have learnt so much haha.","Thanks! They've only been minor things and the doctors have luckily all come to the same conclusions I did.

I mean the general conclusions of most trans people is that sexism is definitely real, most of it is wrapped up in hidden privileges rather than overt sexism, and that yes, men also suffer from the current patriarchy/culture.  Honestly while frustrating, those observations are kinda boring though since they're just so well known (at least among women).  Like ""wow, I experienced exactly the sexism I was told I would, shocking.""","I find it super intresting the experience of people who transition because they have lived the reality of being treated differently by society.

I know people that were horrible students in high school but became great ones in college","Literally the most average people from my highschool became doctors. Some way below average, just had doctor parents. Ah and also one guy with some serious anger issues.

What do you call the student who graduated at the bottom of their class in med school?

At least tell them to put that on record that you asked for something and they didn't give it to you. Sometimes it makes them scared about potential liability and motivates to give you what you want.
Don't be just polite and passive, because that's the easiest type of person for them to ignore. Doctors are not saints or geniuses. Lots of them don't give an f and went to medicine just because it pays well."

448,I agree and I think coming to terms with certain types of past actions are harder than others. We all want to see ourselves as the protagonists of our stories. It can be a massive identity shift to accept you have caused someone harm on that level in your past.,"I think you're right.

It can be frustrating to make an effort to change and then hear that you're part of the problem after making that effort to change. I don't know if you can ever totally get rid of the bad influences, maybe just learn to recognize it and try to act differently? Either way, some people find it hard to come to terms with their past actions. 

It can be hard to step back and realize that these conversations are not an attack on men. This subject is mostly talked about in a negative light, which can initially make it feel like it isn't constructive until we realize how important it is for women to be able to share these experiences and for others to read them and see that this is a real problem that exists in our world. Women are just sharing what they've experienced and venting their frustrations. Men do the same thing! 

Mostly, I think we all just need to drop our egos, listen, and learn from each other.","I honestly think this is why the very defensive “not all men” attitude is so prevalent. I think there are many men who suspect they may have crossed a line in their youth and feel a bit defensive. 

Idk I just know most times ppl get super defensive is because they recognize something in the critique they don’t want to admit is true.","I bet you're right! 

Most if not all of the men I've known grew up with a culture that centers around objectifying women, myself included. I want to say it starts around puberty, but it's probably younger. We learn to channel our attraction and sexual urges in ways that are hurtful towards the women we desire and damaging to all of our relationships with women, even if they're platonic friendships. 

Some boys realize its unhealthy and wrong, usually in their mid-twenties, but some never do. I'm not sure if it's social change or maturity that shifts that mindset. #Metoo started when I was around that age.

I could totally see how both dads could think about how they acted when they were younger, because it's so common! I cannot think of a man I've known who hasn't shown some of that behavior or acknowledged that they did in the past. 

I'm convinced the only way to stop it is for men to purposely change their culture. How we view and talk about women shapes how the next generation will. We have to learn it from somewhere, because little boys certainly don't objectify women from birth. That behavior is learned. Respect can be too. Good on them for believing her and trying to teach that boy to be better.","Tbh honest, I think my brother believed her bc HE was that sort of boy when he was younger.","Wow, sadly I am surprised that both dads believed her...","This even happens when they're sober!

451,"Oh, for sure! Education is a stepping stone in that path. I didn't mean for it to sound like I disagreed with adding education, just that I think it wouldn't solve the problem alone.

I would guess that a big part of what has helped me is listening to the conversations surrounding the Me Too movement. That was part of my on-going education and we never had these conversations in school. Maybe if we had a critical thinking class discussing gender issues, I would have realized my mindset was unhealthy sooner? I hope so.","I agree with that. I still think some standard class to make the standards known makes sense. It doesn't solve the issue of course, it's more to fill gaps that fact that common decency doesn't mean universal decency. Sometimes we have to come right out and explicitly tell kids what is right and wrong and why sometimes.","It's a cultural thing for men. There's not a class or a thing my parents could have said that would have made me act better when the hormones kicked in. I wanted sex all the time and would go to extraordinary lengths or put up with almost anything to get it.

Men in my life always objectified women, which led to me doing the same. Family, teachers, strangers, other boys my age, media...they all influenced how I viewed and treated women, but it wasn't a conscious decision to do it. That's what was normal.

We would talk about ""that fine piece-of-ass"" and even came up with code phrases we could use to say these things to each other in public and not sound creepy to an outsider. None of us were violent, all of us knew about and respected consent, but we were still acting in damaging ways that were unhealthy. 

It's a culture, not just an education thing. We knew it was wrong, so we hid it from women. Maybe the education would have worked at a younger age, but once puberty set in, it was there until I made an effort to change myself and grow. 

Men need to take responsibility for changing how they view and talk about women or this will never change. How we act shapes future generations because kids pick up on it too. Women can help by teaching men and influencing media, but at the end of the day, men need to step up and own changing our own culture or this won't stop.","Heck make it more general then. It's not sex ed it's respecting boundries class.

Knowing that you can say no to someone touching you, knowing that's wrong to intimidate others, knowing it's wrong to take advantage of someone when they don't know what it going on.

All of these can be applied to non-sexual instances too, and are also wrong then.","If the school steps in, parents complain. They either pull a religious argument or ""that's the parents' job!"" and it kills the whole discussion.","Education on sex in the US is a joke, and this is a symptom of that. If parents won't do it the school should step in, except it doesn't really.

Imagine if sensitivity training or a class on sexual harassment was mandatory.",No this point of view is not the problem. You’re right that victim blaming is not a good solution but the person was just expressing how helpless they would be to protect their daughter. Education of men only works if everyone gets on board and as we know not every parent is going to agree they should educate their sons this way.,"This point of view is the problem.  Why is it on women to hide and protect themselves, and why as a potential parent do people think this is the answer? Why not teach our sons to respect women and their bodies and generally not be assholes?

Unless a guy is smart, defiant, lucky, avoidant, or some combination of those, you get an individual who by some male role model was taught that that empathy makes you weak, what you want is what's most important, and that sex defines you.

The only requirement in Canada is that if the fetus is born alive and dies, it's murder. So logically, only medically very (very!) necessary abortions happen after the 5th month.  But otherwise, it's strictly the woman's decision... as it should be.

It’s a wonderful book and I hope you (and your partner) get out of it what you’re looking for!","I found you aswer more than satisfying, thank you. I think I’d be able to cope, it’s been a long time so my injuries have healed for the most part 😊","I can’t confidently answer that question, as someone who’s never been assaulted, but I can give you a sense of how she handles it.

Chanel Miller has a wonderful ability to express the horrors of her case in a vivid, infuriating, moving way, while managing to throw in just enough humor and tangents to keep the book engaging and readable. Whether that humor is for the reader’s sake or her own is unclear (perhaps both).

She chooses not to dwell on physical specifics purely to dwell on them; details are revealed sparingly and with purpose. The book is more about her emotional trauma and healing over time, and how the assault and the court case consume her life and the lives of those close to her (until they no longer do). She writes about how she learns to cope with herself and how to share her experience with others. She also writes about how those processes are not and may never be complete.

So, TL;DR I can’t promise you that you’ll feel safe reading her book. But I do believe she wrote it with other survivors in mind.",He does like to read! I’ll recommend it to him. Do you think it’s a «safe read» for me?,"If your boyfriend likes to read, I’d recommend Know My Name by Chanel Miller.","I was raped at 18 by a boy in my dorm. I was suicidal at the time and had enogh to deal with. I had no idea where the nearest rape centre was.

I know two girls personally, who were victimized by a teacher and one girl who was raped in an underground cafeteria when I attended, I'm class of 97.","Look up the Glen Ridge NJ gang rape case from the late 80's - It's a horrible but fairly well-known story. They even made a TV movie about it. The group of boys were popular athletes and the girl was a low IQ special needs girl that they took advantage of - it was going to be swept under the rug until the story was leaked to the media who finally broke the story open. Simply horrible - they tried to claim it was consensual.

I spoke with another female student who volunteers in the SPED room. She said he made advances and when she declined, he harassed her and threatened her with violence almost daily after that. She also said it wasn't unusual for him to be running around unsupervised. The ""teacher"" of his sped room was often taking off and leaving the kids on their own.",The actual fuck.,"What's worse is that he's supposed to be supervised at all times, especially when walking through the halls.

If this is true then why the fuck was this kid going to a school with other kids? That just makes it more horrific knowing they allowed him to enroll in the first place, didn’t adequately supervise him nor Janie, and continue to let him go to school. 

Fuck these people.","Oh, I’m not saying the boy doesn’t deserve to be brought to justice. I’m just wondering if that was a factor in the grand jury not continuing the case.

I'll zigzag all the way home and have done this, frankly.","Just to clarify, are you saying this as a man trying to be clear you mean no harm? That’s definitely not a bad idea. As a woman I get told to cross the street if I feel unsafe, but also told that crossing the street only shows the big scary stranger just how scared you are making them more likely to attack. It’s good fun being female","I cross the street, if I can. Use the other sidewalk. I'm not trying to get bear maced by a stranger because I walk too quickly.","I feel like that’s something where each individual has a different opinion on what feels safer. If a guy were trying to walk past me at night, I’d be fearing that they’re trying to catch up to me for other reasons. However I also understand that if they were to hang back it would make a person feel like they’re being followed. Kind of a tricky situation to find the perfect answer to",This isn’t directly related to your post. But why on earth do people keep parroting the idea that if a women is walking alone at night a man should hang back to avoid making her uncomfortable? That would make me nervous AF. Men are taller than I am. They take bigger steps than I do. Catching up to and passing me is normal and expected. Instead of lurking at a distance like a shadowy creep why not just walk past me? Lingering is unnatural and unnerving.

465,"You are not wrong for believing something you observed was sexual assault by your definition. Witnessing assault is also traumatizing and I’d encourage you to seek out therapy or at least a close friend and talk through those feelings BUT those feelings, while 100% valid, do not center your friend and her agency which is vital to the recovery process. 

I’d probably handle it by saying something like “I was very disturbed by Tyler’s actions last night. From my perspective, I think he assaulted you. If you need any kind of support - I want to be there for you.” 

She may react by laughing it off or simply say that she wasn’t assaulted and you were mistaken. You can say something like “Okay, I’m sorry I was mistaken. If you ever want to talk about this further I’m absolutely here for you but I won’t bring it up again”. And then go to a space of your own and process your own trauma. She may not be ready to process this right now, she may need to define this without using terms like “assault” or “victim” bc she is triggered by other past traumas, she may be lying to you and seek out help from someone else later but regardless your role as a friend here is to BELIEVE her when she says what has happened to her. Center her agency so that she has a path to recovery. 

Seek out your own peace friend and give yourself grace. It sounds to me from your other comment that you witnessed something traumatic and you probably reacted out of that trauma. It was not helpful to your friend, but it was a very understandable and human reaction. Seek support and talk through those feelings  in your own spaces away from these friends.

You says it's insane to be sexualized just for existing....but sex is WHAT CREATED YOU

Sexual thoughts are NOT perverse","We aren't cavemen. Reproduction for us now includes mental and emotional aspects as well as physical. The fact that even you consider sexualizing random people says a lot about how normalized it is, when it shouldn't be because, again, we are evolutionary evolved from cavemen who only rely on instinct to survive. I think it's more than reasonable to not wish to be sexualized for just existing.","I get where you are coming from...but it is literally INSANE to act like having sexual thoughts about strangers isn't 100% in the norm.

We can play civilized all we want, it's why society chooses a court and consent model now a days as opposed to the capture or purchase customs of old.

However it's literally the single founding principle of all life on this planet.... REPRODUCE!!!!!

So as much as enlightenment is great and all let's not pretend that 100s of millions of years of evolutionary programming is a lewd violation of mind rape law. 

There is a very healthy difference between sexual fantasy and perverse obsession","I feel the exact same. I'm able to see everyone as they are, with 0 sexual attraction until they consent to being viewed like that. I really don't get people who struggle to not sexualize everyone they see or say it's natural to imagine having sex with every girl they see in public. Like that's fucking weird to me, without consent it's just gross and probably violating many of their unsaid boundaries.","This is why I'm a closet naturist.

Believing in something grander than oneself is a profoundly human thing, and I say that with deep respect. Spirituality and faith can help a lot of people move forward and grow, and it can create absolutely wonderful communities. 

I personally feel that wanting to _be right_ about how to go about said faith and spirituality is a _huge_ distraction from what it should be in its very essence. It doesn’t matter whether there is a god, or not. We should be the best people we can be now, just because.",How do you prove a non physical attribute doesn't exist? It'd be like proving God doesn't exist.,I hope you don’t expect for everyone to subscribe to that perspective the moment it’s proven. There are people who think the earth is flat ffs. I’m actually pretty sure religions will dismiss the actual explanation and continue business as usual. They’ve done that for a number of scientifically proven facts.,"Cannot agree more.  Almost finished reading a book called The Hidden Spring.  Science is getting closer and closer to finally explaining that the ""soul"" is just the brain.  It's a hard read but recommended.

Once we ""kill"" the soul, humanity can move ahead with much more unanimity.  If we can survive to that point .","I went to a Catholic university with a lot of these women (and men, but strangely the women were much more vocal against abortion). The argument about fetal life (which is always how they wanted to frame it, focus on the fetus not the mom of course) would always boil down to ""but souls."" These were philosophy majors."
492,"You know, I think you're the first person that I have seen who honestly and accurately describes both points of view without resorting to defamatory accusations.

It usually descends into arguments / accusations along the line of ""You just want to control women!"" and ""You're a baby murderer!""","If you want to get technical, pro-legal abortion and anti-legal abortion.

And the issue is not one of choice. The issue is that of a conflict of rights and a definition of personhood. 

Again, you are not pro choice. You are pro the legality of one very specific choice in one very specific context.

Which I am too.

Anti abortionists are trying to defend what they percieve to be one specific human life in one very specific context through being against the legality of one specific procedure.

It's not ""choice"" you are defending, it's ONE choice. You don't care and don't defend many other choices.
It's not ""life"" they are defending. It's ONE specific way of life in ONE specific context. And they don't give a crap about many other lives.

The rest is propaganda. Condemning their propaganda while considering yours ""the truth"" is the definition of hypocrisy.","Pro-abortion is also a misleading and cringey term, if you ask me. It plays right into what forced-birthers want to believe. That there are people out there who just love abortions and want everybody to get them. The issue truly is one of choice. There are people asking to be allowed to make this decision themselves, and those who oppose giving women the ability to make that decision. It low-key sounds like an anti-choice stance and I'm almost certain that's what you're trying to do with it.","It's anti one choice in particular. The same way pro choice is for one choice in particular. Abortion.

Hence, pro abortion or anti abortion.

""Anti choice"" is made with the intention of implying that those against abortion do so because they don't like people having choices. The same way pro-murder was made with the intention of implying that pro abortionists do so because they want to kill.

Both are crappy, both hinder debate, both are cringy.",It really is an anti-choice stance. This debate is way more about controlling women and removing bodily autonomy than it is about abortion itself. I think it's incredibly apt.,I've seen it used. It's as cringy as anti-choice. They are second-generation euphemisms.,"The position of ""anti-life"" sounds like you're trying to genocide the human race","Why do people indulge anti-abortionists by calling them ""pro-life"".

493,"Oh, far from it. Often times they claim that the pregnancy should be “re-implanted” back into the uterus. There is no proven process to do that.

If god cared about babies the second fertilization happened then he wouldn’t let so many of them be naturally miscarried. They know this. They only care about controlling and subjugating women.

I don't mind that the show is dark. I really love horror as a genre, although I stopped watching the saw series after the second or third one. Those are definitely gore and torture porn.","If you want to give it a try and haven't already, I found the book much more positive than the show and liked it way more. I only watched a few episodes of the show because it felt too much like torture porn (misogyny porn?) to me, but the book shows a way more nuanced, at times hopeful, portrayal of the main character's inner life. Reading the book was invigorating to me, whereas the show felt extremely draining.","Honestly I think full Gilead is the endgame for these guys. I love the show, but I had to take breaks while watching it because it hit so close to home. I honestly think a lot of religious men want this as a reality.","You are probably very much right. The thing that scares me the most is the idea that they *do* notice the issue and try to *fix* it somehow. Because at that point, they'd go full Gilead. Not allowing women to leave the state, not allowing families to emigrate without some 'proper reason', disincentivising migration to an undue extent ('private individuals can't own property in Georgia if they don't live there for at least 6 months a year' or similar rules), or similar.","I don't think they will notice. I was raised Mormon and left, and my limited experience with my family is that religious people fall into two categories. Those that have faith and can be opened minded, critical and logical without losing that faith, and those that wear rose colored glasses. The people who wear those glasses refuse to absorb any information that contradicts their faith and worldview. They will either deny it exists and refuse to look at it altogether, or come up with a bizarre explanation that makes it wrong. These people are very much the same people who will pound a square peg into a round hole, even if it breaks the peg and the board with the hole in it, and then will look at the broken, useless result and proudly proclaim that it's perfect.

Just to be clear, I don't care what people believe as long as they do not try to convert me. Since leaving Mormonism I really enjoy speaking to other people about their religion and culture.

In short, I do not think these guys are capable of critically analyzing this situation, and if they are, they are manipulating the situation into one that will directly benefit them.","It does really make me wonder, to a certain extent. As a progressive Catholic, I have a lot of experience with religious people, including conservative religious nutjobs. From my experience, there usually is an element of wanting to create a 'Godly Utopia' there- lots of misogyny, lots of delusions, but mixed in with an element of genuine desire to create this environment that matches their misguided, horrible, but still genuinely held religious beliefs. A world full of godly Christian couples married to one another in hard-working prosperity, smiling kids running around everywhere.  All white or extremely assimilated POC people, of course, and daddy definitely makes a good bit of money.

I do wonder: When they see in a few years that the people coming closest to that weird little image - educated young families- are the ones running for the hills the fastet, will they realise that something has gone wrong in their grand plan? Or will they be too delusional to notice?","They're not thinking about it hard enough, or abstractly enough, to understand this. At this point I think they're either delusional or doing this just to keep their conservative voters.","I don't think Republicans in many US states appreciate the huge amount of brain drain this will cause. Educated, well-off women, both single women and entire families, will migrate to blue states or leave the US entirely. That includes women who very much want kids.

I'm a married, Catholic woman with three wanted kids who never dated anyone but her husband. I *personally* would not abort a fetus unless it was medically necessary. I'm basically a Republican's wet dream. Yet I would *never* have gotten pregnant in a US red state. My family has a history of complicated, dangerous pregnancy issues. My mum had two (!) pregnancies implant in her fallopian tubes *within one year*. I was very aware when I started trying for kids that I might need abortion as healthcare at some point to save my life. I wouldn't have undergone pregnancy in a state where the failsafe of abortion wasn't  available in case things go south, ergo, my husband and I would have moved. That would have meant the loss of two fully qualified lawyers for that state.

I'm not sure whether Republicans understand that the very people red states need- because many red states are *already* struggling economically- will leave due to fears like the ones you have right now, and the ones I would have had in a similar situation."

It seems a bit disingenuous to bring the two up together when they're not really related much.",">Either you're down with everyone having fucking rights or you aren't

It goes both ways. I'm not happy with the lefts' handling of the pandemic when it came to *some* of the mandates. We unrolled electronic vaccine passports where I am (Canada, so Liberal not left; ideals similar) which made for barriers to access certain things, even care , for people who were not tech savvy. This is particularly true for already marginalized groups -- unhoused, substance abuse disordered, poverty, elderly, etc.. That is just one example, though -- there were plenty that I feel caused a lot of harm and took away privileges that were bordering on taking away items from the hierarchy of basic human needs.

That isn't to say they weren't necessary; it's just that when public understanding and when science changed, we didn't update our approach. We let mothers birth alone. We let people die alone. We isolated our elderly and vulnerable in long term care centers to their rooms for months, not allowing social interaction beyond brief changes. ""Rights"" might be subjective, but let's not pretend that the left is pure and innocent.

We are still denying people visitors in the hospitals if they don't have a vaccine passport, despite having ways to mitigate risk in the absence of the electronic passport. 

The right is absolutely more heinous. I'm just expressing that your statement is far too black and white for such a broad group of politics.","Have 0 respect for ""moderates/centrists"". Either you're down with everyone having fucking rights or you aren't, at this point. There is NO middle ground for that, and unfortunately, you're either part of a political party that WANTS everyone to have rights or you're part of one that thinks that only certain people deserve to have rights- and that the government/state has the right to decide if you are even considered to be an equal person.",It’s definitely not the time to be a “moderate”,"You know what tho?

498,Good luck my friend. We're gonna need it.,"It's just that none of that has to happen that way.

For example, as I understand it, there is zero legal problem with stuffing the supreme court. It's been the general understanding that you don't do that, and to some degree for good reasons, but it's not illegal.

Now imagine a world where the supreme court tries to enforce theocratic rules on a population that's, I dunno, 70% atheists, 25% super-liberal christians/muslims/whatever, and 5% extremists. Do you really think that that society will simply wait for judges now on the SC to die, and to just accept (and implement) all the oppression dictated by them in the meantime? Rather than do the obvious and find whatever loophole there is to stop what almost everyone among the population and representatives agrees is abuse? Like, say, appointing another 10 sane judges to the supreme court so that the religious nutjobs can be ignored?

That's really my point: If there is a consensus in the population that theocracy is not acceptable, then formal rules won't be able to overrule that. It ultimately doesn't matter that some rule says that people need to be oppressed, when people generally disagree. A few religious nutjobs ultimately can not force a whole nation to obey their rules. You always can start declaring their nutjobbery as terrorism and then remove judges from the bench for being members of a terrorist organisation. Or whatever. You generally want to be careful with those kinds of methods, but if there is a vast majority that supports it, that is what's going to happen, no need to burn it all down.","I know I'm part of the problem. But when you truly feel deep down inside that the problems can't be fixed then there's no point in trying. And I do think it's supported by reality. The Trunp administration absolutely stacked rhe most important courts with young extremely radical judges with lifetime appointments. Congress is useless, it's the courts where the real change is. The Supreme Court only hears a small handful of cases a year, the vast majority of established law goes through the lower appellate courts, where they are now overly stacked with young extremist activist judges. And there won't be progress there for 70 years until they all die out. By that time I will be dead, and so will many of the users here. Yes I know I'm being doom and gloom but it's truly how I feel. The only way to fix things is to burn it all down and start over from scratch. But since that isn't going to happen I've given up.

But also, I think that view isn't really supported by reality. Consider that there is a quite significant imabalance between older and younger people when it comes to conservatism, and in particular when it comes to religion. While that means that it could be a slow-ish process, it seems pretty much inevitable that with old people dying, they won't be able to hold on to power, even with all the tricks that they are using.

My mind just like, broke for a second. I had been talking to myself out loud, but like, that's not that weird. Definitely not as weird as what he's doing now. I deadpan stared and said, ""yeah I'm fine"", and he turned around and got back in his car.

514,"An important part of the new guidelines is the inclusion of HPV co-testing. You likely had your repeat pap in 1 year because they didn't test you for high risk HPV variants the previous time. If they had, then they would have seen the high risk HPV variant and had you do a 1 year follow up, anyway.","As someone who went from a clear pap one year to CIN III/suspected invasion by 13 months later at my next annual, I recommend everyone take these new guidelines with a huge grain of salt.

Had I listened, I almost certainly would have lost my chance at having children, and might have lost my life. Im lucky to have gotten out of the situation with only surgery.","While well woman exams and paps are an important part of a womans healthcare, it should be known that Pelvic exams and Pap smears are NOT required nor recommended screenings for oral contraceptives and **guidelines explicitly say they should not be required**. Any doctor who insists on doing so is not following current guidelines, nor evidence based practice. 

The reason many doctors ignore these guidelines and require these exams anyways to prescribe contraceptives is quite literally because of, ""the prevailing view in the profession that if women could get their pills without a prescription, they wouldn’t come in for annual checkups."" This is a common symptom of the paternalistic view of women patients. (After all, men are never required to, say, have a colonoscopy as a condition of getting blood pressure medication, Viagra, or even a vasectomy, even though men are much worse about going to the doctor and getting checkups than women are.)      

Women don’t need to have their birth control pills held hostage to get needed cancer screenings. That’s not just my opinion. There’s hard data to prove it. An interesting article on this topic: [Many doctors are denying birth control to those who won’t take cervical screenings — even though it’s not medically necessary](https://theestablishment.co/bargaining-with-my-birth-control-2a2de4e49172/index.html).   

FYI to any American women who are reading: **Pap smears are only recommended every 3-5 years**, depending on age and history. [This](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/03/14/148520621/doctors-revamp-guidelines-for-pap-smears) is an article from 2012 when they changed the guidelines, but it talks about how overtesting results in unnecessary treatment that can cause complications and problems for women down the road. 

TLDR: Evidence shows that annual pap smears can do more harm than good, so the ACOG changed their pap recommendations accordingly.","Well woman exams and Pap smears are vital parts of preventative healthcare.

Raccoons will only actually fight when cornered, they will not fight you for food. Good chance those ones have been fed by other campers and were more begging than being aggressive. Her emotional distress may have set them off though. Bears generally stay away from campsites except in spring when they are REALLY fucking hungry. Wolves stay far the fuck away from people.

Planned Parenthood, as well as other companies like The Pill Club and Nurx, can prescribe and ship birth control to your door. Usually a pack of pills costs about $20 through these services.

The [Texas Equal Access Fund](https://teafund.org/) provides support and resources for those seeking an abortion.

Costco sells Plan B for under $10.

The law also has a whole thing about how if someone is even *suspected* of helping someone get an abortion, they can get sued for up to $10k. The law allows non-Texans to get sued for this as well. If you need to seek an abortion after September and need help, be as careful as you can to prevent yourself or others from getting implicated."

553,"Sure, many will, and that sort of motivated reasoning is practiced by many Democratic partisans as well (and hypocritically promoted by politicians of all stripes who must know better).

No logical stance is immutable in the minds of Republican voters, only ""Dems bad, GOP not bad, facts only true if they make me feel good"".","I seriously doubt any of Trump's stated policy ideas will do anything significant to address the economic issues that Trump's campaign focused on.

554,"> But Putin's choice to aggressively enter the Ukraine was not just a result of his authoritarian regime. It was a result of a long disputed trade issue that ended up with Russia being backed into a corner in 2014. Putin's support of Trump is based on all of this.

The number one reason Russia was being backed into a corner was its neighbors and most of the Western world have no love or trust for authoritarian Russian governments. Putin doesn't need to expand militarily into the rest of Europe if he can just switch off their gas to get concessions. For the same reason, any other moves he makes to increase Russia's own power or weaken the states around him ultimately have the effect of projecting that power farther into Europe and the rest of the world. It's not like the economic dispute takes place in a vacuum.

There's one other possibility you're ruling out. Trump has been soft on NATO in public. If vacationing Russian soldiers turned up in one or more of the Baltic States, and they call for help, and Trump doesn't fight back, that's it, NATO's broken. Russia becomes the dominant military force in the region. Again, it doesn't mean there will be Russian tanks in Berlin the next day, but that's because he doesn't need to invade everyone to dominate them.

Putin wants to be stronger than everyone around him so that when he *does* want something, they give it to him or are unable to stop him from taking it. Most of the countries around him want something better than USSR 2.0 so they keep trying to block him.

I'll only add that I admire a lot about Russia and hoped they were on course to slowly come together peacefully with Europe despite their internal setbacks, until they turned back to armed force to advance their goals. And now they've bumped Trump into the White House. It's a sad state of affairs.","The US backing down in Syria would allow Russia to have a navel base located within the Mediterranean which allows it to flex it's military strength a lot more. This is concerning.

But Putin's choice to aggressively enter the Ukraine was not just a result of his authoritarian regime. It was a result of a long disputed trade issue that ended up with Russia being backed into a corner in 2014. Putin's support of Trump is based on all of this. 

The result of the recent election will potentially mean that the US will back down in Syria and Saudi backed pipelines will no longer attempt to supply Europe via Syria. Russia will have no need to push into bordering EU countries if they secure this deal with Trump.","> Europe's dependence on Russian gas is vital to Russia's economy.

That also gives Russia significant political leverage on top of its military strength, leverage it's never been afraid to use over weaker states. Understandably, EU nations, particularly in Eastern Europe,  would prefer a US-EU energy supply over a Russian one.

There are no saints in international politics, but Putin's responsible for bringing armed conflict back into Europe after a long period of peace. His domestic rule is firmly authoritarian in the same direction Trump's campaign rhetoric pointed. He's not the kind of leader whose freer neighbors would feel comfortable trusting him with their own futures.",Becuase the EU and the US have been throttling Russian gas trade. Europe's dependence on Russian gas is vital to Russia's economy. Disputes between Ukraine gas pricing (backed by the EU) prompted this push into the Ukraine. This is also part of the reason that Clinton and Putin are so involved in Syria. The plan was to completely remove Europe's dependency on Russian gas by building pipelines through Syria.,Mmm I wonder why Russia is so friendly with Trump. Maybe because Trump will allow Putin to further press their way into Eastern Europe. ,"Not really - once the Trump supporters get a taste of actual Trumpland, they'll be clamoring for impeachment.

My issue is that friendzone used to be a legitimate term, but has since become toxic and rightfully so because of how and who was using the term. But by proxy the sociological phenomenon  associated with it has also become somewhat toxic as a result.

I disagree. The person who attempts to change the terms of a mutually beneficial friendship then flounces out after a rejection was never a friend in the first place, but a user and manipulator.","I think friendzones, or at least when the term first came about, are real and just shorthand, buzz wordy sociological terms for the imbalance that can occur between folks in relationships.

589,I didn’t say that everything is solved. There’s a bigger picture I am looking at here. What are you going to communicate to your daughter about domestic labor (or communicate to young women in general)? That she should just accept it or that it’s worth pushing back on and not something she is required to do just because she’s a girl?,">more households where the woman is the breadwinner

But if covid showed up anything, it's that women are still doing the ""second shift"" when they get home, and still hitting the glass ceiling at work.

We'll agree to disagree here.","I think it does, because it means a lot more kids and young people are questioning the gender binary, which means they are open to questioning what it even means to be male or female which has largely been a social construct, which is kind of wonderful. I didn’t even know what gender non binary was until a friend (previously female identifying) came out as they/them to me a few years ago. I think it does help cis women, because it directly challenges what the patriarchy is holding up about gender norms, and basically is an f you to this system. It’s brave for people to come out as non binary, and it’s the first time gender as a social construct has entered the mainstream, and it does help us.

Yes, there is still sexism, but besides gender fluidity there are things that are changing. There’s more women who are college educated, more households where the woman is the breadwinner (https://www.americanprogress.org/article/breadwinning-mothers-critical-familys-economic-security/), more kids with openly gay parents which, more people coming out as trans and non binary (which you may or may not know about a kid for years), more people seeking treatment for their mental health, more women living their lives on their own and on their own terms. There are more movies and shows directed by women, and this has been awesome because we consume media. Yes, there are still bad things. My point, is it’s also good to acknowledge the positive changes, because the more we celebrate these changes the more positive impact we have on the world. If we only focus on what is worse, then what does this tell young women? It takes away their power in the world. It’s awful Roe was overturned, but there are still more of us that support roe it than not. If we want to push back and keep moving forward, we have to acknowledge the progress and continue to push progress. Otherwise, we are giving up, and yes, we could lose more rights. But, it’s not inevitable if we focus on how we want to shape the world and realize there are many like minded people, who are perhaps, the majority.","Okay, I'll give you that. But I don't really think that the fluidity of transgendered or binary youth really has much impact on cis-girls. Cis-girls and women don't suffer any less sexism than they did before. For them, things are very much the same, and sometimes, a bit worse.","I would say, for one thing, that are understanding of gender is changing, and this is the big, relevant change of what it even means to be a girl or boy in society. They/them is very common and accepted with young people and even kids, and kids are pretty willing to challenge gender norms in ways that didn’t exist before. There’s much more fluidity around gender than there used to be. 

I would also say there’s more acceptance and awareness of mental health and diverging from being neurotypical. So a lot of young people I have worked with are very good at talking about their struggles. This doesn’t mean they’d not have struggles, but it’s not stuffed down like it was a a generation or so ago. This has been my experience working with gen z. I also have a teenage stepson. The most popular kid in my stepson’s middle school was a girl that came out as gender non binary went by they/them and had cool style. It had nothing to do with looks. This is a big change, and would have been unheard of in the 90s or early 2000s. Gender non binary did not exist. 

I’m not saying it’s all better. We don’t live in a utopia or equal society. That being said, I am saying our understanding and attitudes towards gender are changing, especially among young people who, frankly, are leading the way on this, and that absolutely has an impact on how kids are expressing themselves. With parents who are supportive, usually, it’s good and positive.","How are things truly different for girls?

Sure, body and fat shaming is less prevalent, but it still happens. I wasn't pressured to send nude pictures to boys when I was growing up though, and I didn't have to contend with boys watching porn the way they do now in lieu of a sex education. Rampant sexism was going on when I was growing up, but music gave women a lot of power, and the freedom to be exactly what they wanted to be. Remember the Lilith Faire? There was a certain message about the 90's that I don't really see much today: *It's wonderful to be a woman. Celebrate your womanhood.*

I honestly can't really see how things are better today than they were then. I will say that teachers and parents are less tolerant of that shit than they were when I was growing up, but that's because it's *we* who have changed, not really kids.

I guess it all depends on what constitutes a good role model.....but I didn't say there weren't any, I just said there were few. And I really do believe that.","I don’t disagree there are problems for girls. I’m pointing out that there’s been changes, and things are different. That doesn’t negate any issues. I just think it’s worth considering what progress there has been, and that kids are a bit different than when we grew up (assuming you are a millennial). I definitely don’t think all issues have been solved for girls. That would be nuts.

I disagree there aren’t role models though.","Uh, I totally disagree with you. If I'm so wrong about it all, then why do so many young girls have such poor self esteem and still think they need to be beautiful? That is not something that I'm projecting. It's very real and very much a concern of the time. 

If anything, growing up when I did was actually better for some girls, because we at least had the whole ""girl power"" thing going on. These days role models are scant and few."
590,"And why does he insist on living at his mothers house, if her actions bother him?","He eats her head off too. He can go weeks without speaking to her. He ignores her on the daily. It’s like we live there with her but not all that present. We do our own little things. His lack of a healthy relationship with his mom affected me in the past because I wondered if he would refuse to build a connection with my mom because of it. It’s super important in my family that we’re all close and happy and spend time together. He isn’t treated like a “son-in-law”, he’s treated like my parents own kid. The love and respect he receives at my place is not to be found at his.","What does your husband say when your MIL says racist things about you? This makes my blood boil. If any of my family members or friends said racist things about my SO, heads would roll.","I love him and I want this to work on the long run. But it deeply hurts that I don’t know how to be the bubbly person I once was. And now my grandma is deteriorating but the one person I want to go with me, refuses just the idea of traveling to my country. Fuck. 

I know all the answers lead to I’m unhappy. AND I AM but fuck I just want to be happy with him again. I want to live life with him. I want to do things with him. I can always do it solo but I want to WITH him, and that’s my downfall. 

I know I’m being frustrating because the answers ARE THERE but I can’t help but want things my husband doesn’t. 

I’m just feeling a lot and needed a safe place to let it out. I’m so sad.","Honey you literally just said several paragraphs about why it’s not just about travel.  

It’s not.  His unwillingness to travel a symptom of his larger attitude towards you, your culture and your race.  


There’s nothing wrong with YOU.","I think it is. But I also wish he’d spend more time with my family. Like actually learning them and being present in their lives. 

I try to build a bond with his mom all the time. She’s super mean to me when he’s at work and I’m home. I usually have to spend my free time outdoors to avoid her. I only tell him a few things at a time because I know his relationship is already so bad with his mom. 

I try not to make it worse but I’m living in hell with him just so I could be near him. 

I feel like I’m dying in order to be loved. My family means EVERYTHING to me; yet I left my comfy home to spend our marriage at his place. 

Why can’t he come and stay with my family while saving for money? It’s not like we had a traditional marriage. I stay with my family almost every other weekend. If I can handle his moms racism, why can’t he handle my family? We’re just a bit loud and have more fun at home. 

It’s the little things that have become big because I don’t see him trying for my family but I try everyday to be accepted by his mom. 

I have to hear about my dark complexion, what I can wear or not wear because “bright colors don’t look good on dark skin and dark colors also don’t look good on dark skin” 

I’m considered white in my south Asian community. I’m considered almost sickenly pale. Yet I’m getting told on the daily that I shouldn’t wear this or that. 

I try so hard to be accepted when he isn’t home. Or when he is home. I’ve just recently stopped trying because NOW when I look in the mirror, I see myself as dark and now I have an issue with it too. 

I’ve never been a colorist in 27 years of my life. Now when I lay on his chest, I’ll tell him “wow, I’ve really gotten dark” 

Fuck, it makes me cry just recalling this from the other day. Like I actually told my husband “my arm did get dark huh” 

Why have I become so disgusting.","Bare minimum doesn’t sound “great” to me. 

The problem isn’t about just the travel, is it?","In other ways.. everyday things are pretty nice. He makes sure we get to have our date nights, he’s more emotionally present and physically present when he isn’t working and home. He spends more time with me, he tries to meet my physical needs. I acknowledge all the little things he’s done for me. 

It’s just.. it’s bare minimum.. so I’m left feeling like the things I ask for more—aren’t being met. 

I’m sure he’s probably feeling discredited and misunderstood. I’m sure he has complaints about me too; but I just feel like I’m so giving and out there and I wish he’d meet me halfway."

597,I doubted myself for a bit too. I enjoyed the conversation too so not futile. Have a good'un.,"I’m really sorry! I watched this video previously, and despite going back and seeing this warning, I somehow completely missed it that it was YouTube’s doing. I thought that you were referring to trigger warnings that this creator uses, without actually understanding you. 

This argument has been futile and my fault! :(","I was reading it as the video had been slapped with these warnings by YouTube, who were basically saying that the content may be false and may mislead the viewer in some way that would have a negative impact on society.

It may be that these content warnings were in fact general trigger warnings that were added by the creator with positive intent.

If it is the latter I retract my previous criticisms, but looking at it again it does seem to be something YouTube has added to ward people away as if the video is going to e.g. incite hatred or violence.

You then get into the query of is this similar to censorship or is it more similar to a general age rating as you might see for all movies.","I think you’re wrong about content warning being about information, but I’m not 100% sure what it is. Here are two options:

1. Content warnings means that the medium features content that may be triggering, such as Abuse, Murder, Substance use. Trigger warning is about the discussion of such, without necessarily featuring content. For example, I could have triggered a classmate while talking about abortion, without actually featuring pictures, videos, recordings, written experience of abortion. I should put a trigger warning. If I do have any of these, i should’ve used a content warning for abortion. 

2. Content warning is about a medium featuring content that elicits strong negative emotions, such as abuse, murder, substance use. Trigger warning is about a medium featuring content that might elicit a traumatic response in someone. If my discussion includes depiction of excessively harsh criticism, and a classmate has traumatic responses from experiencing excessively harsh criticism, I should have a trigger warning, but not a content warning. I should have a content warning if I depict or mention something that will make most people very uncomfortable. Think Gordon Ramsey calling a cook stupid and him freezing/crying because of childhood trauma

So when a video contains hate-speech, a content warning would mean “this video will contain depiction of hatespeech and not just mention it” or “I think that most if not all of my audience find the hate speech that I will depict as disturbing, instead of eliciting a traumatic response in only a small part of the audience”","Yeh. So this video seemed to have one that basically said ""be careful with the information in this video, it may be false"". That is absolutely ridiculous.

The ones that say ""this video touches on topics that may trigger xyz"" are a good thing.",Aah. I think I got you now,"Regarding content warnings: More or less I have no idea, but different ones. The ones calling out hatred (like this one) really shouldn't have content warnings, and there are far too many genuinely hateful ones that don't have warnings but should.

Trigger warnings are a different thing, and are absolutely fine and more videos should have them.",Are you saying “more videos should have tw” or not?

601,"That’s why twitter calls it “deactivation”, not “deletion”. Deactivating your account will not be subject to the 14 days GDPR law because it’s not technically “deleting” your account.

Source: I help manage global user data for a cloud company and have to do things differently for EU customers.","The law applies both internationally and to private companies. If twitter doesn't pledge to be deleting all user data when an account is requested to be deleted within I believe it's 14 days then it is not legal for them to operate in any EU territory and they can face a fine worth I think it's like 10% of their yearly earnings plus whatever other damages the EU court decides. 

Twitter can still be accessed from Europe so I'm fairly confident they are following this law.","not everyone, including Twitter itself, is in the EU. Also, now that it's a private company, they might just decide to keep all that data for themselves whether you delete it or not.",If you delete a tweet it's still backed up for 14 days so that changes nothing. Just deactivate the account. EU law mandates that all personal data is deleted within a certain amount of time after account deletion.,"This is not true. You have to delete all your tweets otherwise your data is still there. There are 3rd party bots that do it for you because the only way to delete tweets is individually.  Basically, you have to give the bot your login and password and it goes and runs the script. I learned this after I deleted my 15 year old account when Musk announced his intention to buy. Gotta nuke it completely otherwise he still gets your data whether you use the site or not.",Deactivating is deleting,"Hijacking top comment to ask: how do I delete my account?

Eventually it mentioned “deactivating” the account, but I’m not sure if that’s the same as deleting it.","Nah I did this same thing a few days ago aswell.

604,Lmao nice,I'm the same. I had an IV removed and they had a cotton ball on and a bandaid over it. I walked out of the hospital and everyone was looking at me.

Not that that can catch a whole load of blood most likely,"I'm a REALLY hard stick, and then I bleed everywhere when the needle comes out.

605,"Not heated at all, and the psychiatrist I gathered earlier.  Good luck and be well","i appreciate it as well! while self esteem *can* be indicative of how successful someone will be in life it's actually one of the more shaky ways to determine their success. personality theorists see incongruence between who one is and who one wants to be as a more solid indicator for distress and other similar issues in life. This is where i really think gender roles can hurt people, like you said with your point on nature vs nurture and how they could be passed down by parents. A child who's raised to be a girl that doesn't want to be a ""girl"" (in the context of feminine stereotypes) would probably show a greater incongruence between who she is/pressured by her family to be rather than who she wants to be and that's where you'd see more insecurities or, on the other side, more acting out. (Acting out is seen more with authoritarian or negligent parents) 

It's also definately frustrating to see it take it's toll on others you know.

Though self esteem can be built back up, you're right that it's incredibly difficult to climb out of those types of thinking. With therapy and psychiatry, many times it's not an option that many people can afford or just would be too embarrassed about attending due to how stigmatized it is. There's an incredibly large multitude of factors at play with situations like this and it really depends on the specific situations that lead to seeking out abusive partners, knowingly or otherwise. 

If any of this comes off as heated i assure you I don't mean for it to, i just got out of classes so I'm a little fried, also if you want me to clarify anything please ask, I'm studying to be a psychiatrist and love talking about personality theory and child development/psychology","“Loser magnets” are the ladies who say “why do I always go out with losers” as you saw it wasn’t an insult. I also agree that a woman who’s never been in that type of relationship ends up with that personality trait. It’s either a family member talking down to (or at) her or radiating off a parent who’s witnessed it in their parent, I don’t know exactly. I will say it’s way to common and until there’s some way to teach self-esteem it won’t get better, unfortunately. But how, I think that comes from your own successes, win at sports get more confidence playing, same with exams at school, but I hated to see it in some of my daughters friends. I appreciate the dialogue","I'd say you're right that self esteem plays into it, i see it as the result of a self fulfilling prophecy wherein the women who you so hilariously put as 'loser magnets' are that way because they believe they can't do any better. what interests me is what causes women who're neurotypical and haven't gone through trauma/psychological programming by an abuser, to develop that sense of themselves and when it takes form. Gender norms seem very pervasive with younger girls, which reminds me of this really great video essay I watched about the book titled 'the care and keeping of you' and how that book used to perpetuate ideas about dressing modestly and that it's not okay to discuss puberty and going through it (for girls of course.) 

All this to say that i think you hit the nail on the head and that I believe part of that insecurity for women who hadn't already had it programmed into them is caused by how heavily parents or caregivers adhere to gender roles.

 I think the idea of the ought self and the actual self also definately go hand in hand with this but i digress- I'd be happy to try (to the best of my half completed psych degree) to explain those a little more, it's really interesting stuff!","Thank you, your thoughts if you don't mind.","This is an interesting comment, I'm just commenting as a bookmark to see how the discussion goes when more people reply!","Interesting you say that and here’s a theory of mine.  I’ve always said the most attractive trait any woman can have is self-esteem or self-confidence. Most real men are not afraid of a successful, intelligent woman but they are attracted to them where insecure “men” or I’ll say abusive guys avoid them. A woman with little to no self-esteem in fact are loser magnets (is that too harsh?). In that situation the guy sees a woman who won’t question him, when asked “where do you want to go eat?” will say wherever you want is fine, what movie “whatever you want to see” etc. which for that guy is great until it’s not. At some point that does get old and that’s when he changes and isn’t nice any longer, now it’s “can’t you make a choice?” “Why am I always deciding, can’t you make an F’in decision?” etc. and it gets worse from there, I believe that’s why so often it’s “he was so nice when we started dating then he changed….”.  So a confident woman attract confident men.  Any replies either agree or disagree?",It really is. What you’ll find though is men do exist who value strong women. And the reality is those guys still were formed within and live in a culture that is misogynistic AF so they won’t always get it right - but when you call them on their shit they’ll listen and learn.

You were specifically talking about violence against **AFAB** people

>to women (and enbies) who are **AFAB**

I said that it isn't because someone is AFAB vs AMAB

>I think it's less of an AMAB vs AFAB thing
 
You were the one pitting AFAB vs AMAB (a line of distinction that I, as a non-binary person myself, hate). You were the one who in response to a trans* person turned around and said that AFAB people have it worse. It's no different than those men who turn around and bring up how bad male suicide statistics are, but only in response to people commiserating about misogyny. Which is especially egregious when statistics show that ""women who are AFAB"" don't actually experience violence ""more so"" than trans people (once again, including non-binary people such as OP) of **either** AGAB.

Look, I'm going to stop replying here. All you're doing is flipping an uno reverse card and going ""no u"" on the bits that I'm calling out.

EDIT: and I've been blocked","um, the post also says that OP *now understands what women experience* in terms of harassment and violence.

This is a lot more complicated than you think it is, and actually unpicking the nuances and challenging some of the assumptions here is a necessary and important thing to do. Shutting down discussion and trying to make people compete with each other in the way you are attempting to push for is incredibly unhealthy. Literally nothing in my comments is anything but supportive of the OP, and it’s possible to be supportive *alongside* engaging in a wider discourse. You do not have an absolute right to set the terms of discussion here.

Further you posted a link talking about violence against women, and yes, compared to men women are much more likely to be a victim of violence. However, OP is not a man, nor were the groups addressed in the comment you replied to (with the exception of femboys, but them being men is secondary to the point being made). I brought up statistics of violence against trans people because non-binary people are definitionally also transgender (with some very rare exceptions where a person may be intersex **and** also raised as such).

622,"Sure, and others need a harsh reminder that women are not a means to a end, but ends in themselves. 

&nbsp; 



Gentle suggestions for therapy and philosophy will not reach men who threaten violence because they aren’t getting compliments or their dicks sucked. I’m out of fucks to give for woman-hating, slut-shaming miners of manosphere hate.  Their quality of life *might* improve with therapy, but if they want a partner, they will have to actually respect and regard women as fully autonomous humans with the same natural rights to happiness and freedom *they* enjoy. There are no shortcuts to romantic or social success, and impotent rage towards women is a prison of their own design.","Thats actually the point. Thats the part of men that needs to change. They need to stop seeking validation from women and that needs to come from how they're raised and their environment, therapy for those who deviate.

Edit: to clarify, it doesn't always need to be positive reinforcement. Their environment can change in a way that is hostile to unwelcome behaviour. But if we are talking about changing the most people we can for the better as possible then both the carrot and stick should exist.","Well put, but so long as that benchmark requires the use of another’s body, I feel comfortable demoting desire for female validation.","Its the male equivalent of a woman's value being tied to her desirability and ""purity""(yack).

Its obviously not the only thing. But society demanding multiple things doesn't undermine any individual one. Its just whichever benchmark you dont meet is what you're supposed to feel like shit over.","> Its not innacurate to say that patriarchal norms train men to act this way.

It’s inaccurate to claim that men’s entire identity and mental health is wrapped up in their reputation with women. 


Anyone from any culture can easily lay down a quick list of what traits make a man. Strength, competence, respect of their peers, courage, independence; confidence. But romantic success is their supposed sticking point? 

&nbsp; 


Nah. Prowess does do not define a man; prowess is what a man *wants*. Men are now claiming that romantic success is how masculinity is defined because it lends urgency to a made-up problem.","Its not innacurate to say that patriarchal norms train men to act this way.

Where they go wrong is thinking it actually excuses behaviour and they dont need to change. They do need to change.

Poverty causes robberies but doesnt make it okay to do. People with minority characteristics will automatically be at disadvantage even though it is unacceptable. Society will often cause ails that manifest in the actions of individuals. Short term solutions are needed to address the individual while long term solutions address society. In this instance it'd be the destigmatizing and accesibility of mental healthcare.","Women know this, but men counter with the claim that “society” has trained men to believe that sexual validation from women is the measure of a man’s value. 

&nbsp; 

Sounds good, except it’s blatant bullshit. Society has no knowledge of the individual man’s sex life. The individual *wants* sexual gratification and frames it as though sex and female validation are essential to life, placing the burden of their mental health on women.","The cure for mens loneliness is not women, its mental health care.

Just like the cure for addiction isnt drugs, its mental health care."
623,"yes, and what do you think is going to happen in therapy besides “men, just stop?” i’ve already offered other solutions and i can give you many more besides what you’re saying which is, “men, just go to therapy”","Therapy is not a cure all for anything.

Its not a cure all for drug addiction. Its not a cure all for mental health. Its not going to be a cure all for men that hate women for whatever motive they may have. 

But it is the best we've got. Therapy is also for a lot more than literal mental illness. ""Men, Just stop"" is never going to work. We have to make them.","it’s coddling that we suggest them going to therapy is all they need when people have no idea the slightest amount of what actually happens in therapy. if you go in and say “i’m lonely,” well the therapist is going to just suggest you meetups and activities to go to, where the man can then harass women there with professional approval. the therapist will not figure this out until a couple years into it, because it takes time to dig through the surface at the inner issues. we could have been raising men differently this entire time instead of wasting time and resources on people who have no intent on becoming better and hardly see women as people. 

for example, mass murders are an incel related problem. this is not cured by therapy. it’s also multi faceted. men who feel entitled to womens bodies do not have a mental illness or any kind of emotional distress. they are simply frustrated that they can’t demand sex and have women fall at their feet.

suggesting therapy is also problematic because it suggests these men have a mental health issue. this is far from it. they are usually very privileged and live comfortable lives. they are fully capable of changing their mindset on their own, to stop watching misogynistic men on youtube, to stop laughing at rape jokes, to stop blaming women for all of their problems. they choose not to.

inb4 “therapy is for everyone”, no it’s really not. if you go in there with no actual pressing issues, you will just stare at each other for 45 minutes. learned this the hard way.","Not trying to makes leaps, I just really don't understand what you want. I don't think you actually want less men in therapy, that's just what it sounds like. ""Men need to fix it"" is not an actionable solution so I can only base what I think you think the solution is on the fact you are claiming therapy to be a solution by women and therefore a bad option.

Destigmatizing therapy IS the societal solution.

Therapy is not coddling, as you mention it is hard work and requires active effort to change yourself.","you’re making a lot of leaps about what i’m saying. individual people going to therapy is great. but suggesting every man in current society enrolling in therapy will fix the problem is insane. it’s clearly not a personal issue. and when you treat a societal issue like that, you make the societal solution women, again, in a different setting. i’ve been going to therapy for years. i know the kind of work they do. if you do not actually want to change, you won’t change. it’s hard work. its exhausting. i highly doubt these types of people are willing to put in the effort. stop coddling them.","So, your argument is therapy wont work?

Therapy actually is ""them working it out themselves"". People go to therapy to work on themselves. Going to a therapist isnt nonconsensual, male or female they can turn down any patient they want. 

Youre also making it out like these are convicted felons. These are guys who think they are lonely and want to figure out why. The therapist will tell them their want for a partner is a deflection from why they are actually unhappy. Therapy ensues.","not what i was saying at all. but putting dangerous men in a close setting with women is a bad idea, and also just reinforces their belief that women are there as tools for them to use to feel better. the long term solution is that men stop feeling so goddamn entitled to womens bodies and time. they need to get used to it. this stuff is not only caused by porn, the media, their fathers, but also encouraged and shared by men among each other. nothing women say will change their perception of women. they need to work it out themselves.","Thats the short term solution but doesnt tackle the cause. We also need long term solutions.

Your solution is like having soup kitchens but no effort to create affordable housing. Sure, you're saving lives now, but youre really just surviving while maintaining the status quo. 

And in no instance does anyone that knows anything about mental healthcare think the actions of a patient are the fault of the therapist."

629,"The early Romans believed that a good woman was a woman who did nothing noteworthy, except to honor her male relatives and her family’s lineage.

Lucretia is held up as an example of a virtuous woman because she “allowed” a man to rape her when he said he was going to kill her and a male slave in he bed as if he caught her in the act of adultery. She would rather be raped than shame her husband by being accused of being adulterous. After the rape, she called her husband and father to her, “confessed” to being raped (it was seen as the woman’s fault, no matter what) and then killed herself to preserve her family’s lineage and honor.

Roman women didn’t even have real names. Each daughter was given the feminized version of her father’s name. If there were more than one daughter, they would be named Julia Major (older daughter of Julius) and Julia Minor (younger daughter of Julia).",Thanks for the rec! The Aeneid thus far has treated the women characters as mere convenient plot devices. Some truly WTF moments.,"After you finish The Aeneid, you should read Lavinia by Ursula K. Le Guin.

And so good too! I'm reading The Aeneid right now so I'm getting bits of the whole Trojan War saga from all these different works.

630,">I knew a woman who adored babies, but lost interest once they could speak.

That might be a woman who simply can't stand toddlers, I know they can be very difficult, but it also reeks of narcissistic mother to me - likes infants she can dress up like dolls and use as extensions of herself, but no longer likes the child once they're able to form and express preferences that might differ from hers.","Thanks for doing that! There’s so many cool subreddits out there; hopefully someone knows of some data. 

I do love a good tangent. ❤️  I could see communal childcare reducing the need to opt out of getting pregnant/having a child.

I know a smidge about infertile women in BaManianga society but because having children was part of how you became an ancestor I can't conceive of a woman admitting openly to not wanting children. Second wives were a not uncommon strategy if the couple was infertile but a lot of childcare was communal and the wives lived together away from the husband so I'd imagine there was high involvement even on the side of the infertile first wife.

I literally used to beg my parents not to have anymore kids after me (I'm the youngest of my siblings).

Why is it that if a 16 year old girl accidentally gets knocked up and goes through with the pregnancy, no one bats an eye but a woman in her early 30s whose never wanted kids ""might change her mind""?

People outside of /r/childfree tend to think it's a toxic sub because sure, some people don't like kids but honestly there's a lot of support and we can all commiserate with each other about our frustrations of what it's like to be a person who genuinely does not want children.

Agree to disagree for sure","You can set your own standards, that's fine. But in my experience, setting higher standards gets you a better, more considerate partner. So I will always advise women to leave if they aren't being considered. Feel free to not follow that advice.","If I was in a relationship and someone got me a Christmas present I didn’t ask for or even allude to wanting and I showed appreciation, but didn’t get them anything and then got broken up with immediately without discussion, I’d think that person was nuts.

I’d never do this, but if I *said* I’d get something for them and then didn’t, I’d be more understanding if they wanted to end things immediately, but I’d still think an immediate break up without discussion would be a drastic move.

There are plenty of fish in the sea, and women have historically been taken for granted when it comes to hetero relationships, but what I see now is a lot of people over-correcting and just sifting through men until they find the perfect man that does the perfect things.. and I just think that’s so silly because no one is perfect and if you expect your man to know all the “rules” of common courtesy and won’t sacrifice a second of your time to discuss your expectations, you better be fucking perfect, too",No. I don't think you should ever have to ask for common courtesy. I refuse to ask people for basic consideration. There are better fish in the sea.,"Yes, but there was a key thing you said there: “keep asking for common courtesy”.. I personally am just waiting for OP to say explicitly that she has had a conversation with her SO.

She says this has been happening for two years and she said he said he doesn’t celebrate Valentine’s Day (but I wasn’t under the impression that the topic of the gift giving empty promises is what led to him saying that.. I took it as them speaking generally about that particular holiday.. I could be wrong though of course) and then she said she’s just not going to get him a gift anymore..

She never said she that in two years she’s ever actually had a conversation with him about this thing that clearly bothers her.. maybe she did, but I don’t like filling in contextual details in order to form an opinion.. I’m very curious to know what he’s said when she really brings it up.. if she has..

People are going to walk all over you if you let them.. and if it turns out that OP just kept expecting her SO to spontaneously change without having a real conversation, I have no issue putting some of the blame on her for not standing up for herself.. hints and passive aggressive huffs and puffs doesn’t translate (which I know is a huge assumption there - I’m just giving a generally example).. but yeah, if you’re in a relationship for two years and don’t feel comfortable being straight up and having a conversation or just otherwise letting something like this go on for two years without explicitly discussing what your expectations are, that’s not completely on the SO..

All that said, IF it turns out OP has in fact been continuously “asking for common courtesy”, I’m 100% with you and the majority of the people in these comments..

And actually, I’m not even an advocate for second chances honestly.. setting a boundary one time should be enough.. if they care, they only need to hear it once and there are plenty of potential partners out there who “only need to hear it once”.. I feel like a lot of people are taking what I say as “be patient and lenient on men because they don’t know better” which is not my sentiment at all, but people are responding to me like that’s what I’m saying.. I am literally just saying: “step 1. say something”

Am I assuming she hasn’t said anything yet? More like, she didn’t say she said anything so I am taking that as she didn’t say anything.","I think the opposite - people take yellow flags and don't have the proper caution, and that's how they end up in relationships like the one OP describes, where their partner fails to show up time and time again. I've dated too many people like that to even give them a chance - and then I ended up with a great guy who *doesn't* drop the ball. It's better to be selective than having to keep asking for common courtesy, imo.","I mean, I guess we’re all just different, but if I were in this situation, it would clearly be an issue (if he wasn’t giving presents, but I was), but it’s no where near deal breaker territory for me.. especially if I haven’t even had a conversation about it first.

I posted another long winded reply elsewhere, but I just think the yellow flags in a relationship are worth a conversation before jumping ship, because people just think differently and prioritize differently.. my sister once blew up at me for something I didn’t see coming one bit.. it was just a blind spot for me.. off the record: I still don’t quite understand why it was a big deal or how she even cared to put so much energy into being bothered about it, but guess what? I didn’t say any of that stuff to her, because whatever her reasons, it clearly bothered her and I care about her and that was enough for me to care about this thing that bothered her and be more attentive to it.. I think the “you can’t change people” is taken too literally and rigidly..

Additionally.. the other side to this is determining.. hey, is this a yellow flag? or is it an incompatibility? If it were me, I’d be on the other side of this.. I *hate* giving/receiving gifts.. the only difference between me and this guy is that I would never say I’m gonna give someone a gift in the first place.. if he got me a gift, I’d say “ohh you didn’t have to do that! Aw, thank you! I feel terrible I didn’t get you anything” and that’d be the end of it.. if that happened several more times, honestly, I’d be as uncomfortable as he felt slighted, like.. he’d think “why isn’t she getting the hint that she should be getting me gifts” and I’d think “why isn’t he getting the hint that I don’t do gifts”.. that’d be an indication of incompatibility.. then if we have to have a conversation, depending on how compatible we are in the other areas, if he really expressed that he’d appreciate more gifts, I’d absolutely give in without question.. but if he says “oh, I was just doing it because I thought you were supposed to but if you really don’t care about gifts, giving or receiving, then we don’t have to do that”, that’d be even better

Honestly, I only like giving gifts if I know the person is going to like it.. like if there is something I know he’s been eyeing for a while and a special occasion is coming up, I’d definitely get it.. if a special occasion wasn’t coming up, I’d just get it as soon as I could if it was something I could afford readily.. gifts for the sake of gifts straight up makes me nauseous and gives me anxiety, giving and receiving.. to have it deemed as “who would want to be with a person who doesn’t give gifts on special occasions” - I take that personally.. and I just really don’t think that’s a hard rule the way a lot of people here are making it out to be","Does she really want to date someone who doesn't take the time to think ""hey maybe I should find my gf a gift like I told her I would for this major holiday that many many people give gifts for and my gf gave me one two years in a row"". Even if he's not malicious, he's dense and the opposite of thoughtful - how far does this extend into their relationship? Deal breaker."

Most men are decent. Guys that rape or harass tend to have multiple victims. 

So while every woman has a story about assault or harassment,  many guys are surprised by how common it is."
643,"You can believe that, and I'll continue holding people accountable for their actions.","Hundreds of full adults are investing in gold honestly believing that within 6 weeks the US will cease to exist. And screaming at their confused children that wonder why these previously sane people people are throwing all of their resources away on something worthless. 

They don't believe that because they are idiots or insane. They believe that because someone convinced them to listen only to the news they provide. 

Honestly I find people are imbeciles more often than not. I see it in my daily life as well. 

And it is my firm belief that education could cut down on violence, rapes, shooting, abortions, etc.","If you're raping someone and putting your penis in a vagina you know where it goes. That makes no sense. 

We hear no a million times a day in various contexts. All of a sudden men don't know what no means when it comes to sticking a body part in someone? Lol bs. 

I'm not confusing anything with anything, and was referring to intimate partner rape when I said that. Strangers don't gaf regardless. Again, if those same boyfriends said no and their gf did something anyway they'd absolutely know they didn't want it. 

It's not rocket science and you're treating men like they're imbeciles and likely make other excuses for them.",">We all know what ""no"" means. 

At the age of 15 and having completed sex ed I still had no idea that a penis can go into a vagina. That is a little detail that many programs leave out because parents object to children seeing diagrams of sex or detailed descriptions. 

The main education of sexuality is porn, where ""no"" means something other than ""no"". Any other view is naïve. 

>We all understand consent. Flip the scenarios around on the rapist and they'd suddenly understand if it happened to them. They want what they want and the rest doesn't matter.

The mass majority of rapes are confused boyfriends that go too far. You are confusing that with stranger danger where a stranger breaks in and rapes.","Lol a rapist doesn't care about education and communication. We all know what ""no"" means. We all understand consent. Flip the scenarios around on the rapist and they'd suddenly understand if it happened to them. They want what they want and the rest doesn't matter.",Which again turns it back into a matter of education and communication.,"Whether they believe it or not, rape is rape. That doesn't change anything for the victims.","Very few rapists believe they are rapists. They do exist, but not the majority. Everyone is the hero of their own story."

Asked her later "" How many go back? "" Seemed surreal to me, he didn't have his claws into me that deep yet and I had a baby to protect. She looked around, made this almost hopeless gesture said "" All of them "". I said "" I won't "". That doesn't make me special, like I said he didn't have his psycho claws deep enough into me yet .

Please do report, every time. Might be someone not too far into a psycho's power to break free. Have always worried about those other women. And their kids- there were other kids in there too.

And I'm happy about that too. Don't care if that sounds heartless.","People ignore it often when people choose to be with someone abusive. Because you call the cops on someone for beating his girlfriend and the cops show up and the girlfriend is defending the boyfriend, saying leave them alone, calling the person who called the cops an asshole and getting in their face about it.

651,"This still has nothing to do with what I said. Stalking and obsessive exes are a major, massive issue, but one that is very difficult to deal with as laws aren't really designed to stop people who haven't broken significant laws.

But again, that has nothing to do with anything I spoke about. Leaving someone, leaving the house you live with your partner in and are in a relationship with is what I'm talking about. How you deal with an ex who won't leave you alone is a completely different situation. For one thing you have to leave said relationship and stop living them to be in the situation you're talking about.

Cutting them off from friends and family is a choice you allow to make, and yes I understand why it happens. but being cut off from friends and family in no way means you have no choice but to stay and saying their is no choice is frankly gross.

Saying they have no choice gets people killed, they have a choice, you're denying that they have authority over themselves, you're treating abused partners as not just victims but wholy incapable of acting on their own. 

It also ignores that eventually, after the 15th time they get back together and finally leave their abusive partner, it's because they exercised their choice.

Turns out they managed to bend a steel bar reinforced door, smashed balcony window, one of them went through a table and a guitar and tv got thrown out the balcony. 

Pregnant girlfriend and his family stay there (despite accusations he beats her). A few weeks later I here another fight but the other guy had already moved out so it was the guy and his pregnant girlfriend. I heard what sounded like her saying ""I can't breathe, stop"" so I called the cops and went to knock on the door at the same time to try to stop him doing anything worse before cops got there.

She eventually left and I walked with her to her car, she was thankful but also made excuses for him, didn't stay to talk to cops (though they talked to her later). 

Cops basically couldn't do anything, the friend who got put through a table and door did nothing, she didn't leave and was back there the next day, all I got was the stink eye from both for calling cops.

That's the issue, you interfere and the abused dramatically more often than not stays with the abuser. You get emotionally invested, you feel responsible by calling the cops, you have to talk with cops and take the anger from the people you called the cops on and the result is usually that the abused gives you shit as well as the abuser.

These women aren't staying by choice. Abusers gaslight and brainwash their victims into thinking they have no other options. 

No, they do have options and they almost always have a choice, they just choose the bad option. 

I absolutely know how abuse works, you do not. Someone gaslighting you is doesn't mean you have no choices. If you choose to ignore teh abuse and allow their lies to persuade you to stay that's still a choice. 

Cutting them off from friends and family is a choice you allow to make, and yes I understand why it happens. but being cut off from friends and family in no way means you have no choice but to stay and saying their is no choice is frankly gross.

Cops come, arrest the boyfriend and you're literally physically separated, but you have no choice but to defend your boyfriend/husband, bail them out and stay with them, absolute bullshit. 

>Saying that people choose to stay is entirely incorrect and gets people killed.

Saying they have no choice gets people killed, they have a choice, you're denying that they have authority over themselves, you're treating abused partners as not just victims but wholy incapable of acting on their own. 

It also ignores that eventually, after the 15th time they get back together and finally leave their abusive partner, it's because they exercised their choice. The choice is often hard, horrible, it can mean taking your kids into the unknown, or potentially facing homelessness, but to say there is no choice is fucking ridiculous.","> People ignore it often when people choose to be with someone abusive.

You clearly have no idea how abuse works. These women aren't staying by choice. Abusers gaslight and brainwash their victims into thinking they have no other options.

My mom stopped slapping us and started throwing us against walls.  Neighbors made comments about how strict our household was.

She used to berate or pinch or slap. She started grabbing your hair and slamming heads against objects.

Finally, she knocked my father down the basement steps and then went down and grabbed his head to smash it against the concrete floor. Neighbors continued to laugh at my father. Blaming him for the horrible abuse he constantly took. They would rather make jokes about his masculinity. They would rather watch this for decades.

I overheard gossip as they stood outside staring toward our house.

Hoping one of the adults would know what to do. But all they ever did was ignore or mock our suffering. 

Calling the police on my own mother was so emotionally difficult. Because the abuse teaches you to freeze or fawn to keep things peaceful. Survival is protecting and coddling your abuser. If you can just be good enough, keep them happy and calm...well, if they get angry it's your fault. Not theirs

 Living in abuse is a fucked up survival mentality
 
Calling the police on her would be counter to survival. Your whole body breaks down even considering such a betrayal. Even if it's in defense of your siblings and father, the thing is their survival is also tied up in the abuser. Your every instinct goes against protecting yourself.

 I had to learn to discard wanting to survive.  The hope for anything improving had to die entirely. And I was finally able to do something so traitorous as calling the police for help.
 
It was something I was only able to learn once I lost all trust in the community.

They knew. They did nothing. 
 
Neighbors looking the other way just means you are a silent audience to whatever comes next. Maybe they leave. Maybe someone ends up dead.  But years of trauma will continue unchecked.

Interfering is better.  Even if it can occasionally be a catalyst.","Because they don't leave their abusive partner, and they get even worse treatment once the cops leave.

654,"Right. I have a friend who was dating a girl a while back, and I suspected that she was abusing him. I knew him several years before he dated her, and we worked at the same place.

She told me that he was crazy, and abusive, and that he once put a cigarette out on her arm. Normally if anyone were to hear that you'd be alarmed for the woman. But this one was different. She told me this almost.... gleefully? And he was sitting there right next to her, not saying anything. As time passed, my friend was becoming increasingly sullen at work. She called him almost daily, accusing him of cheating on her. He would complain about her spending all of the money he had put in their joint account.

One day we all went out to eat somewhere and I think she said something I disagreed with, and logically explained why, which probably made her feel stupid. After that day, my friend started making excuses as to why he couldn't hang out after work anymore. On top of that, there were some other mutual friends they had that saw him as an abuser so they stopped hanging out with him. She was isolating him.

One day she texted me saying to stop giving advice to him. She claimed it was because his dad wanted them to only follow the advice of the couple's counselor they were supposedly both seeing.

I ended up messaging his dad on Facebook, and he was aware that she wasn't all that she was cracked up to be, and asked me to support his son, which I was going to do anyway.

Eventually they broke up, but was still wanting her to take him back. He was eventually served a restraining order. I went to the courtroom with him, but he accepted ended up not fighting it, and accepted the restraining order, which was the best thing he could have done.

But, to just lump them all together as ""weak"" is wrong - it is implying that someone needs to be perfect in these situations (and, I compared it to society's view of the perfect victim, too - one who leaves on the first offence and who behaves exactly as society expects - both are skewed views).

We need to focus our scorn on the *abusers*. Not the victims. Not the witnesses. They (the abusers) are the ones who are wrong here.

No one saw the full series of events. But about about a dozen people saw part of it.

Two of the 12 called police. Only one person went outside, a 70yr old woman who held Kitty as she died. After she was stabbed and raped. 

I'm sorry but 2 people saw her get stabbed. One only called the police AFTER she was basically dead, AND the old lady found her and started shouting:

""Intoxicated that night, Ross heard noises and after deliberation, cracked open his door to investigate. He saw Genovese laying on the ground, still alive and attempting to speak, and Moseley stabbing her. He shut the door and called a friend to ask what to do. The friend said not to get involved.

Ross eventually climbed out of his window and went to a neighbors apartment. He called the police after hearing Sophie Farrar call for someone to do so. Ross’ explanation—“I didn’t want to get involved”—became the famous rejoinder of the Bystander Effect.""

I don't know why we discourage ourselves from mutual aid. Well, I can think of a couple of reasons in Western society. But in any case, it's nice that the evidence shows people can be awesome.","Absolutely. Doing everything they reasonably can to help. Even if it inconveniences them by making them late for something... it's worth it when a life is potentially at stake. After all... maybe the abuser doesn't kill the victim this time. But maybe they do next time, and next time they're quieter about it and it goes unnoticed. 


I just think of the infamous bystander case mentioned in psych... where a woman was beaten (iirc to death?) in an alleyway, and not a single neighbor called the police... though several heard and/or saw it happening... one did shout out from their window. Which briefly scared the guy off. 

Any neighbor could have likely gone outside, or grabbed something to use as a weapon, and simply scared the guy off with their presence. But no one did.","... Or trying. We can't individually make them stop, but yes, everyone must try to support others who need help. Otherwise what is the point of us?","This. In my experience, most people don't call. Don't interfere. Most people are not good people. A good person would interfere if able, or at least call AND ensure the police found the right place and were able to intervene. 

Most people don't want to be bothered, tbh. And like to think of themseves as good because they would never beat their wife... but that's not all it takes to be good. Being good also includes stopping people doing bad shit.","Omg your story is so harrowing. This could have been me. My ex used to always resort to strangling me. It was his MO. 

No matter how loudly I screamed for help while trying to run away from him or talked about it with people practically begging for help, no one ever did. We even had roommates who KNEW and saw what was happening and would go in their room and lock the door rather than help or call the cops. Only once out of 3 years did the cops ever get called and I found out the next day they went to the wrong place and didn’t even follow up or try to find the true source. 

People always talk big like if they heard or saw something they would do something. Lmao. No. Not in my experience. The bystander effect is very real and people are very selfish."
659,"That's an interesting topic... thanks for the book recommendation, I might have to read it. There's definitely lots of bullying types in my workplace.

Seems like it might the workplace version of a pdf I got on reddit : ""Why does he do that"" by Lundy Bancroft.  Which focuses on abusive relationships iirc.


Idk. A long time ago, in middle school... i found out another girl was being raped by her father. I didn't tell a guidance counselor because I didn't want to make her situation worse. I've checked up on her facebook, and she seems to be well adjusted and living a happy life. But what if things turned poorly? She was always cutting her wrists (self harm, not suicidal)... what if she died? I probably would have regretted not speaking up. I'm glad she turned out okay. But I don't like to live with regrets, wondering if things would have turned out differently if I had just DONE something or said something. 


I might regret it if i get seriously and permanently hurt trying to help someone. But i definitely will regret it if I provide 0 help. If that makes sense.","Of course. 

There's an interesting book, *Nasty People and How To Avoid Being Hurt By Them.* (I think. It's been a while) It's more about manipulative workplace bully types, not physical abuse. But the lesson is the same - Why do people say/do nasty things? One main reason is because they don't feel good about themselves, and they boost their own self-esteem by putting others down. For the physically abusive, this means inflicting hurt so they can feel that they are superior, because deep down they know or suspect they are less than others and can ""prove"" this is not so by being the physically dominant.","If they're gonna hurt a victim for someone trying to save them, they were going to hurt the victim anyways. 

Interfering doesn't change anything when you have someone violent who is looking for an excuse to abuse.


Ie. The abuser will say ""I'm only doing this because you tried to escape"". But if they didn't try to escape? Then the abuser will say ""I'm only doing this because you didn't wash the dishes"". 

It's like how a cheater will always cheat... an abuser will always abuse. They just make up excuses and find anything wrong so they can try to explain their behavior. When deep down it's just that they're fucked up.","Very good points. 

Except - nowadays, a bully knows the power of a phone and will see any move to call, record, or whatever as a provocative move. And, they are unpredictable. Stand well back, be ready to run. 

I'm an average height, slightly(?) overweight guy - but I haven't been in a serious fight since grade school. I seriously doubt I could take on some guy who has a habit of physical violence and a berserker attitude where they could be aggressive without regard to themselves getting hurt.  I don't want to find out the hard way, because if I lose the victim- if they don't want to leave - is no better off than when I started. Most likely worse, now the guy is angrier. ""See what trouble you brough onto me!!??""","Calling 911 takes less than a minute, assuming you know where you are. (And you should always know where you are tbh, pay attention to street names and businesses nearby... or look for a nearby house #). 

Then hit record on your phone. To get video of the person and what they look like. What they're doing. 

Telling them you called the police and are recording them will often get some to stop without a physical altercation. 


It can be a bit more obvious if they're on drugs or drunk... in that case just keep your distance. 
It shouldn't be too hard to outrun a drunk if you're in even half decent shape. 


I'm a petite woman who weighs just over 100lbs. Doesn't mean i would just run and hope the police or someone else did something. If i get hurt. Then i get hurt. But at least i wasn't a coward who stood by and didn't even try to help someone being actively hurt. 


Granted, physically interfering depends case by case. If you see a stranger attacking someone for no reason (ie a random street attack or something), then take into account, can you AND the victim handle the stranger? Are there any makeshift weapons you can use nearby? 


Domestics are a bit different. Because the victim has to be the one to want to leave. And if they aren't ready to leave their abuser, they'll likely attack you or get mad at you for interfering. And let's be real, there are very few cases where a woman is being locked in a house and 100% unable to physically leave. They usually stay out of a misguided sense of love. And repeatedly willingly go back home to their abuser.","The problem is... what are you going to do?  The aggressor is likely drunk, and obviously acting irrationally. Unless you're the type who can definitely win a no-hold-barred bar fight, the moment you get involved you put yourself at risk. 

Calling the police is obviously the best idea. However, you are dealing with an irrational violent person. If you even open your door or knock on theirs  to tell him off, and then the police show up, he may simply blame the person who told him off. Just call the police and let them handle it.","This. In my experience, most people don't call. Don't interfere. Most people are not good people.

660,"Wow this is so profound and correct and completely relatable to how this has been going for me. Thank you again, kind internet stranger, for the wonderful advice and conversation. I am so thankful. This is a weird type of validation that I didn't even know I needed. I'm a bit lost for words but what you just said restored some of my peace.","People don't like admitting bad things happen.  We fear them and many people try to hide from the truth, that bad things do happen.

Men don't have to deal with the frequency, ubiquity, or severity of sexual assault so most chose to pretend it doesn't happen.  Lots of women like to prescribe traits to victims in an attempt to distance themselves from bad things.

This is one of those things that many people, men and women, will try to invalidate your feelings on.  They will try to make it seem less severe because they want it to be.  But it doesn't change reality and you need to listen to yourself better and not let others' convince you it isn't a serious issue.

Men do not need to be following you, or running after your car, or banging on you windows.  All that is really fucked.

Be careful with pepper spray in a car.  Wind can blow it in your face.  It helps to crank your air on full blast and shoot it out of a cracked window with all the other windows up.",Wow you're totally right thank you for validating my feelings and making me realize the severity of this. I'm so appreciative of that you have no idea. I feel like maybe I have desensitized myself to these kinds of interactions.,"You shouldn't try to not let it bother you.  It is a very legitimate reason to be bothered.  You are really minimizing your feelings.

You're pretty much saying ""well at least they aren't sexually assaulting me yet"" so i have no reason to be bothered.

You are completely justified being bothered by men BANGING ON YOUR FUCKING WINDOWS trying to make passes at you.  That's messed up behavior.",I've been trying to not let it bother me so much because honestly it could be so much worse. Like at least they haven't touched me. But there was an incident today and I have been bottling this up for a while. I felt like there might be other women on this sub who would understand. But yeah I'm scared to leave my house a lot of the time and being at work is really stressful because even on days where this doesn't happen there's usually men that stare at me and it makes me really uncomfortable.,"I try to not respond unless I feel I can add something meaningful.  I didn't really have anything meaningful to add but I felt bad for you.  I really cannot even imagine being in a situation like that but it terrifies me for others...

I can imagine it being stressful. It would make it hard to even leave.  Make you hate going to work.",Thank you for reading my rant I have just been so stressed from all of this lately,"I bet you could set it up to have two different sets.  One for windshield wiper fluid and the other pepper spray.

But it would definitely be a good idea to get some pepper spray if there are so many creepy ass dudes there"
661,Yeah! I'm grateful she was willing to try things to make it easier,That's really great they're offering numbing gel! I'm sure it'll go smoothly with that.,"My doctor was actually amazing it just hurt so much more than I expected. I'm supposed to try again with another appointment next week and this time they gave me a numbing gel for it, I'm just really nervous",It's different for everyone. It wasn't nearly that bad for me. Either your doctor wasn't doing it correctly or you might have a condition that gives you higher sensitivity but I would at least talk about it with your PCP if you don't feel comfortable mentioning it to your OBGYN.,Can I ask how you got through it? I had one on Wednesday and it hurt so bad it was unbearable and I had to ask her to stop.,"Oh yeah, I just wasn't prepared for it to hurt but I got through it.",How much did it hurt? Like was your doc able to do the whole pap smear?,"I'm not sure what it's ""supposed"" to be, but mine wasn't painless"
662,"Okay, that's fair. Online it's kind of skewed but when I asked two friends of mine and they said that it different didn't hurt them that bad and that it's kind of concerning if it does lol","Nah it's not considered ""painful"". Like when I think painful I think endoscopy, or getting a plasma draw (basically anything with a big needle.) But I've never heard of pap smears being considered one of the painful procedures.",Is it like not? I've been doing probably way too much reading online on pap smears and I've seen things saying it's usually painless and then other things saying it's commonly painful... So idk about you but I don't actually know how it's supposed to be?,"Yeah I mean if it was a procedure that was widely known as being maximum level uncomfortable, outdated, old-fashioned...I would have a different opinion.","That's actually insane that so many women on here can convince themselves to get through it, I don't understand how y'all do it. I was telling myself the same stuff at my appt, on god, and it was still unbearable.","Yeah, there was something that helped me, I sort of just told myself over and over it will be over in a minute, I trust this doctor, she has a careful touch so I trust her...basically just taking deep breaths and trusting that the doctor knows what she is doing.
I think it's good they rescheduled, no need to start again right after quitting, that was nice of them. Better to wait it out then retry later.",I just had a pap smear done and I really wanted to get it over with and done too but I just couldn't. I even asked them after I got dressed if we could try again but they didn't want to because it went so bad. I know it's for my health to get it done so I rescheduled of course but I'm really stressed out and I think it's once again not gonna work. Was there anything in particular that helped you when it hurt?,"Yeah in short, the second time it hurt a little bit more than I expected it to. I did let her finish the exam because I trust her as she's a doctor (and the nurses also did there best with me, like asking if I prefer a female doc or if either female or male is fine. I felt more prepared because I knew they took the time to check that with me, for instance.) And I wanted to finish the pap smear since I went all the way there to get it done, because preventative treatment is better than treating something that's blown out of proportion, just trying to stay healthy etc."
663,"She didn't put any fingers in, when do they do that? 

She also didn't say that it being so painful was abnormal. I think maybe I should ask her about it","Yes. It’s similar to when they put their fingers inside you to check your ovaries, or when you insert a tampon. Not a “fun” feeling, but not painful","Is that how it is for you? Like they just put it in and open it quickly and it's completely fine?

I know these questions are dumb as hell and I'm sorry but you're legit blowing my mind","No. It’s just something being inserted into the vagina, it’s not by itself a process that should have any pain associated with it.",Wait really? The speculum part shouldn't hurt?,"The speculum being inserted and opened should be painless. I wouldn’t call that part fun, you wouldn’t just go have that done to yourself because it feels good, but that is not a painful thing at all. More just discomfort or feeling weird or odd.","She told me they were quick! I could barely get past the speculum being inserted though, and every time she actually tried to open it the pain was so intense. I just don't know if how much I hurt is normal and if I should just bear it when it should be quick","Painless no. It’s quick though, you just have to let them get the cells. It takes seconds"
664,So many women are telling you it’s offensive and you’re choosing to die on this hill. I wonder how many generalizations the women on this sub could make about men like you…,"There isn’t a problem. When that happens you respect how that person wants to be referred to. Which is how you should treat everyone. Until then, female and male are not offensive in nature.","If a woman doesn’t want to be called a female, what’s the problem?","That was a cute attempt at an insult. I understand what kind of person you are. I’m not gonna bite on your bait though.

 I just use the terms Male and Female outside of casual conversation to avoid any issues. Thank you for inquiring.","If you’re describing people in a scientific study, sure.  

A woman is an adult.  A girl is a child.  It’s pretty straightforward.  There are actually adjectives to differentiate age if that’s relevant (it often isn’t).  If you’re skittish about calling a 22-year-old a woman, I think that’s a you problem.",Of course you can. Though they do denote an age also. The better terms to use when appropriate would still be male and female.,So men and women aren’t words you can use?,"I’m honestly not sure and I’ve been shocked to hear it. I use male and female, I deal with adults. You really shouldn’t be using boys and girls outside of casual company, both have been used to demean and insult. Male and Female are the proper terms and should be used where appropriate."
665,"Just a heads-up, do NOT use lotion on your fingers or anything while inserting them inside your vagina.
Lotions/soaps/creams all can change the pH balance inside your vagina and cause unneeded issues. As they have a lot of chemicals in them and such. Not sure about coconut oil as well.

I would suggest you use proper lube/lubricant that is used for sexual purposes, they're specifically made keeping pH and everything in mind.","Thank you but I'd rather have someone else(that is trust worthy) to do it, but I doubt anyone would want to help me with it😅",I would trim and file your fingernail — you don’t want anything to be sharp and pokey. Then use something to make your finger slippery — maybe a dab of lotion or coconut oil. And then just move very slowly and gently. You will be okay.,"I know this sounds weird but I'm scared to push in my finger in there, I'm clumsy so I'm scared of hurting myself, but also because I'm scared of everything 😅","I never had that problem so I am not sure. The pill is not large. Can you get a finger in? If you can, that is plenty of room for a suppository.","Ok, but how do you insert it when you're a virgin? I tried many times with a dildo, but then I get a uncomfortable/painful feeling even when I didn't insert it, I just push in a little and it hurts, so how would I push in a pill? I'm scared of pain and I really can't tolerate/handle it so idk.","Boric acid is a certain type of acid that is generally in the form of a powder that can be put into a capsule. A suppository means that you use it by inserting it into your vagina. What it does is get everything in there the right pH, which allows the healthy microorganisms to grow and kills off the unhelpful microorganisms.","How do they work? What is boric acid? And what is ""suppositories""?"

My IUD caused horrible UTI/BV problems that only went away when that devil device got removed,Dude you have an IUD? I just saw your post history.

Yes, Nexplanon is a type of hormonal birth control. It contains the active drug etonogestrel, which belongs to a drug class called progestins.

669,Good luck with everything!,Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I really appreciate it. I’ll have to update you once I have my MRI 😊,"Short answer: If it were my ovary, I would do the recommended follow up just for the peace of mind that it's probably not a cancer or something scary, but I really wouldn't lose sleep over it.

&#x200B;

Long answer: It's scary when anything shows up on a scan! I like to tell my patients that imaging is good for finding lots of things, both benign and bad. And as imaging gets better, we find smaller and smaller things. That's good because we catch the nasty stuff, like cancers, earlier, but we also find lots of small benign things as well. Doctors want to make sure any finding is in fact benign, so that usually requires follow up, whether following something over time, or a different kind of test, or both. It causes a lot of anxiety on the part of the patient, which totally sucks! 99% of the time it's nothing dangerous, but that 1% where we do catch something small so early makes a huge difference to those patients, so in the end is putting people through all that testing and anxiety worth it? There are varying opinions, so that's where the physician expertise comes in. I'm not a doctor, but I see this play out a lot, and never have I ever had a patient say they regret going through the testing to confirm something was benign.","Okay thank you, so this doesn’t seem alarming? I’ve never had anything wrong with me do the fact I need an MRI is terrifying lol","Occasionally. But usually only when they're really big and it just takes the body a while to break down all the blood products. My facility refers out for OB/GYN, so anything that doesn't resolve gets sent out to to a bigger hospital and I usually lose them to follow up. I will say tho, that the worrisome ovarian pathology almost always is big when found, or gets bigger quicker on follow up scans, like grows by centimeters in 6 months. The little 1-3cm endo cysts or teratomas usually stay pretty stable. I can't stress enough how small a 1cm ovarian cyst is in the land of radiology. It's really hard to be exactly sure what it is by ultrasound.",Thanks! That makes me feel better. I have one last question for you- Have you ever seen a hemmoragic cyst not resolve within the 3 months before and still be that kind of cyst?,"Generally not. Most commonly endometrioma or maybe a small teratoma. It's just over a centimeter big, that's very small to accurately characterize by ultrasound anyway.",Thanks. Is a hemorrhagic cyst commonly misdiagnosed for something more serious?

674,"> if you genuinely don't trust your SA with sex

It's usually shortened SO for significant other, SA tends to mean sexual assault.","For lots of guys, throat fucking is a kink, including for me. I've only ever been able to do it a few times because most women don't like that gag reflex, and I totally respect that. Just make sure to set boundaries beforehand, and if your SA violate those boundaries, consider leaving. This is just to say that this kind of kink isn't far-fetched by any means. Hell, it's an entire category of its own on most porn sites. On the other hand, I've had gfs whose kink was rough play/hands tied/light slapping. This is not a kink for me at all and I feel super weird slapping a girl, even if it turns her on. I guess we're all very different and we all have our own kinks. Just make sure to set boundaries beforehand and make it clear that a violation of those boundaries will result in you leaving.

In this particular case, I think only you can make this decision. Like you mentioned, I don't know if your past sexual trauma is leaking into this situation or if you genuinely don't trust your SA with sex anymore. Look deep within yourself and decide how you feel about the whole thing and go from there. Don't listen to all of us as only you can gauge whether he is being genuinely sincere and whether you can move past this.

But forgetting not to rape your partner? Forgetting not to tell about other sexual partners?! That‘s just not things one can forget. The telling part requires planning to tell the boyfriend, and much more than a slip of tongue. And going on when she‘s puked?! That’s just insane. A normal spouse would ask if their partner is comfortable if anything out of the ordinary happens. And forgetting to be gentle? The fuck? Is he a roided up animal or what?","People who ""forget"" boundaries are lying. I have a friend who's in an open relationship, with the caveat that it's only when they're apart and they do not discuss their hookups by the request of my friend. All well and good. Except his boyfriend *repeatedly* ""forgets"" and tells him all of his escapades, which deeply hurts my friend, who has to re-establish boundaries, who then gets hurt again the same way. It got to the point that I had to tell him straight-up that this is not his boyfriend being inexperienced or forgetful, this is his boyfriend getting off on the power over him. And he *still got back with this dude*. 

Toxic people target vulnerable people who will go along with them and we have to not get so caught up in positivity that we make excuses for abusers.","And how many victims of sexual abuse end up in relationships with this sexual dynamic and whether or not it’s actually healthy or just retraumatising, especially with a guy like this who says he “forgot”  boundaries. This situation sounds so dangerous and unhealthy - OP, I really worry for you.","I try to be sex-positive and I get that BDSM is a thing but I wish we could have an honest conversation about whether a bunch of the men ""into BDSM"" that hurts/dominates women could just be violent misogynists who use kink to excuse their impulses","Guys who hurt you during sex actually just want to hurt you.

677,"Oh my God, that's horrifyingly",The reports that a record number of teenaged girls are being admitted to the hospital for anal tears makes me deeply uncomfortable and sad,"This. You immediately get branded as not being sex positive if you want to have a frank discussion about the increasing misogyny in porn or the bdsm crowd (which seems like everyone now.) I have a teen niece who talks to me, and know that so many of these girls believe that they have to do anything a boy wants to be desirable, even if it feels terrible. 90% of the porn online these days is extremely degrading to women, and this is mainstream now, not even seen as kink. Violently skull f'ing, hair pulling, spitting on women, calling them whores, slapping their faces, coming on their faces/tongues, etc. is all totally normalized as mainstream, not even branded as kink. I'm sex positive, but I think a lot of girls have been bamboozled into accepting sexual aggression and misogyny by shaming them for supposedly not being sex positive or cool if they don't want to be treated like garbage cans. Somehow I feel like our feminism has been used against us in today's culture to trick us into doing sh\*t that feels degrading and painful. I'm uncomfortable with the turn it has taken. 

I can't help but think of Armie Hammer, using the guise of BDSM to rape and abuse very young women, telling them they don't need a safe word and they belong to him to do anything he wants with them, burning them, carving his initials in their skin, biting them, beating them, choking them, all without explicit consent, going well beyond their limits and providing no aftercare when he left them behind, bleeding and severely bruised. All of that was done in the name of kink, and he thinks that just because he talked them into being tied up, that they no longer could withdraw consent for any act he chose to do to them. Each of those girls describes feeling totally confused and violated, but not having had the language to explain at the time how he raped them when they agreed to sex and even BDSM, but not the extreme violence that he escalated it to without their consent.","I try to be sex-positive and I get that BDSM is a thing but I wish we could have an honest conversation about whether a bunch of the men ""into BDSM"" that hurts/dominates women could just be violent misogynists who use kink to excuse their impulses","Guys who hurt you during sex actually just want to hurt you.

678,"100% agree! You have to really want it on your own and be secure. Any pressure or if it comes from a relationship is horrible.

Anyone in the community will tell you that there’s people who just want to abuse their partner and they are not welcome. In a sub/dom relationship the submissive one *always* is in control, because they can stop it whenever they want to.

I think it’s a safe bet that men who want to hurt women and use BDSM as a cover are more likely to have deeply ingrained misogyny that they can’t hide, whereas people whose sexuality is defined by kink and would be just as horrified as anyone else at the thought of actually hurting someone likely have a better understanding of interpersonal and societal power dynamics","I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to say that kink is like that in the majority of cases.

When I said ""chill out, no one is talking about BDSM,"" they simply continued to argue from the assumption that using the term ""My Slave"" meant he was a kinkster which had nothing to do with him also being a rapist and we were all just being big ol meanies to kinksters. It was fucking asinine. 

I'm tired of acting like so many men being into the brutalization of women doesn't give me pause or that consent cannot be pressured. But maybe I'm just a judgemental vanilla loser 🙄","I think it (as in ""safe sane consensual"") should generally be legal \[1\], but at the same time it seems obvious to me that the ""D"" side in BDSM is almost inherently predatory behavior. Meanwhile a huge share of the ""S"" side has been the victim of sexual abuse and assault prior. ""Come to think of it, I was sexually abused as a kid/teen, maybe that does have something to do with my kinks"" seems to be very common. So yeah, I mean, isn't it obvious that BDSM / kinky sex, in the majority of cases, is a man manifesting his predatory desires on a sexual abuse victim, consent and ""everyone enjoying it"" notwithstanding?

\[1\] The state has - in my opinion - a duty to protect people, sometimes against themselves, in extreme cases even against their own express wishes. There are limits to what one can consent to.","I try to be sex-positive and I get that BDSM is a thing but I wish we could have an honest conversation about whether a bunch of the men ""into BDSM"" that hurts/dominates women could just be violent misogynists who use kink to excuse their impulses","Guys who hurt you during sex actually just want to hurt you. 

I cant imagine anyone thinking otherwise.","Seriously. I had a bad feeling about it when she said that he could ""take it out"" on her. Yikes.","Yeah there are a lot of people out there who go that hard with oral... more common than you think. But she expressly stated to him to be gentle today - and he should have respected that.   


OP - don't resolve your fights by having kinky sex. I've been down that road and it just doesn't work - it makes things worse for you because it just overcomplicates things and brings your vulnerability way way up. Resolve the fight and go do something wholesome. Save the kinky sex for when you are both in a good headspace, not fresh off a fight. <3","Wait, you threw up and he kept going? Can you explain more? Did you throw up a tiny bit in your mouth and he had no idea that happened? Or did he witness you actually puke and think “sooo sexy let’s ram that cock in there some more!!”

Because the first one is clueless and thoughtless, the second one is actively and intentionally cruel. I cannot on any planet imagine making my partner throw up and continue doing the same sex act like nothing happened."
684,"Technically it’s BDDSSM:

The initialism BDSM is first recorded in a Usenet post from 1991,[1] and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and submission), and S/M (Sadism and Masochism).","Isn't the S in BDSM Sadism? bondage, discipline, sadism, masochism?","I think it (as in ""safe sane consensual"") should generally be legal \[1\], but at the same time it seems obvious to me that the ""D"" side in BDSM is almost inherently predatory behavior.

690,thank you! i was going to type a longer comment to that person saying essentially this but i really just don’t have the energy to argue about this anymore lol.,"Oh for fucks sake! Porn is not normal sex. It's manufactured for men, and uses women where it chews them up and spits them out. I'm from LA, the porn capital of the WORLD. And guess what? Every time there is an outbreak of fucking syphilis (which is really deadly), the clap, or pretty much any other STD, it can always **BE TRACED BACK TO THE PORN INDUSTRY**. 

Not to mention that it is very damaging to young children that are just coming into their sexuality and don't know shit about sex, to watch two adults go at it where the guy throws the girl around, chokes her, cums on her face, and skullfucks here. NONE OF THAT SHIT IS NORMAL. Women internalize this shit as young girls, and men internalize this shit as young boys.

We live in a country that really lacks in sexual education, and yet, porn is everywhere. That's pretty much what young children are getting as a sex ed. 

>Porn is a huge industry

Which is also largely unregulated and does not practice safe sex. People in porn circles DIE because of the rampant STDs that happen. Yet the porn industry doesn't give a shit about them, they just keep on keep on, refusing to get their male actors to wear condoms and practicing questionable business practices. You may be unaware of that side of it, but the porn industry is seedy as fuck in every possible way. 

I am very sex positive and don't have any pearls to clutch. But porn just keeps getting more and more extreme, and further and further away from what real sex is.","I highly doubt all these things you are clutching your pearls over are as new as pornography is, it’s more like we as a society have changed and people are more open and comfortable discussing their sexual proclivities. I’m also unsure why you keep trying to demonize porn, it can 100% be part of a healthy sex life (whether single or in a relationship), and you may be surprised to learn that not only do plenty of women watch porn, they also watch it with their partners and use it to open up discussions about mutual fantasies and kinks. Porn is a huge industry and there is literally something for everyone, some people really like the more hard core stuff (and there is plenty of it), but there are lots of people who like gentler, more female pleasure and couple/romance focused porn (and there is plenty of this as well).","In this case it wasn't. So why feel the need to defend it? Also, this, and also the guy ejaculating on a girl's face wasn't a thing until porn came alone.

691,"Yes. 

Can you not see that there is another issue as well,  if it's a new behaviour??","It. Doesn't. Matter.

It doesn't matter if he made her throw up with her consent every other time they had sex. She set her boundary \*for this time\* and he completely disregarded it and assaulted her.","Yes,  agreed. 

If he did something pretty extreme that was new then I would say the situation is very different from doing something normal for them that looks extreme from the outside. 

I'm just asking so I understand. 

It could be more concerning or less concerning depending on the answer.",People can change any boundary at any time. If that's not respected* that's SA. He knew she didn't want it rough and did it anyway.,"I think it does matter :)  It does not make it OK even if it's normal for them,  but it does change the background. Even in this discussion,  we started with the act itself and now we are talking about what she asked for. They both potentially matter,  but we can't know without asking :)","She said she wanted it to be gentle this time, it doesn't matter how rough the previous sessions were.","If it's normal for them,  then that is relevant.  

We can't tell two consenting adults what they can do. Or rather,  we can,  but that's about what we like and not what they like :)","Why is it important, when he made her vomit *and held her down while he kept going*?"

But no. I was just sharing statistics, and this is what the stats look like. If you're involved with a man, you automatically, statistically, are more likely to die by his hand. That's the cold, hard truth of it. Men kill women far more than most anything or anyone else does. And it's mostly the men close to that particular woman.

Police know this. That is why they almost always start off with the man as a suspect when a woman gets murdered or goes missing.

703,"Thank you for this. It’s very easy to say “no sane person would do something like that”, but these guys don’t behave like someone who’s (medically) delusional. They’re angry, filled with hate, lacking respect and remorse, and convinced that their reasons are justifiable, but they know it’s murder and do not care.","Yep. Logically, extreme violence is an indicator that the perpetrator **is not** mentally ill, so they should be handled with a level of wariness that **exceeds** that used around people who are genuinely mentally ill. 

The violent perpetrator has the greater capacity to assess, plan, mislead, and enact violence - a true and ongoing threat to anyone who gets close enough. 

People are unsettled by the perception of unpredictability in a mentally ill person, but perceived threat does not translate to actual threat. The average person wants to think that a sane person (as they think they themselves are) is not capable of such brutality. Spolier: some humans just suck.

Thinking mental illness = threat is a bias I wish everyone would examine within themselves. The world could be a kinder place if we did.","Thank you!

704,"I remember watching a true crime doc about a teenage girl who lured a 12yo girl into her car and took her out to this place in the woods and brutally tortured her before killing her. And unsurprisingly it turned out her parents had done some truly horrifying things to her throughout her short life. It made me so sad that the teenage girl, though she was the one who actually did the horrible acts to the other girl, was to be punished for the rest of her life because of what her parents had done to her. It disturbed me that her parents wouldn't even get punished for what they did either. Our society is all about pointing the finger and calling it justice and then we're shocked that horrible things keep happening. I think people have a hard time understanding that trying to help, to rehabilitate, to prevent, to teach, etc. is not the same as excusing horrible actions. 

I'm very sorry about your uncle.","People are so supportive of trauma victims—until they admit to committing some heinous crime during a trauma response, that is. Once victim becomes victimizer we call them depraved monsters. My dad used to say your empathy isn’t worth much if you can only empathize with people you understand, and I think that applies here. I really don’t think anyone *set outs* to become a sociopath.

I’ll never forget my mom telling me about my kind and mind-mannered uncle coming back from Vietnam asa very young man and maniacally running down a dog in the road. He later said he couldn’t clearly recall the incident, and was really disturbed by it happening. He also experienced what everyone called “extreme fits of jealousy” when he later married the love of his life, a widow to a young man who died in Vietnam, whose photos he would violently smash while hyperventilating. It seemed clear to me that there was a hell of a lot more to it than just “jealousy”.

I’ve been in relationships with people who were badly abused as children and have seen a couple different versions of trauma responses. When that shit hits, I really don’t think people have control. They become strangers to me, but also to themselves. These were people whose abuse ended by elementary school yet it clearly affected them deeply. Even with a therapist, with family support and a very motivated individual, it is really, really hard to undo that damage. And most people aren’t getting any of that.

I’m fairly sure there are statistics on this and the fact is that a significant portion of violent offenders in prison have experienced significant trauma. You can absolutely fuck up basic human development, like self-regulation and empathy, with the right combo of trauma and lack of support.

ETA: And I honestly don’t know why people act like suggesting there could be some reason humans seem more capable of heinous violence in some geographic regions vs others is “letting people off”, but I suspect it had something to do with the “justice=punishment” mindset that puts dangerous people in concrete boxes with each other so they can become even more poorly-suited due release into society.","I don't want to argue with you because I've got the whole gamut of mental illness myself, but it is very very common for abusers to have been abused themselves. They are often mentally ill. Well-adjusted people do not abuse others. And pointing out the mental damage that using violence as punishment for children causes can help teach folks to stop doing stuff like that. In general I don't think acknowledging the mental health of violent and abusive people is meant to demonize everyone with mental illness as violent, it's more so acknowledging that being violent is not normal and it often occurs because of abuse by caregivers.","Thank you!

So, even in my close life, I have never told a woken how to feel about a childbirth. If you had read better you would have realise that I, again, just said my opinion.

Also another thing, the boyfriend may not actually have a ""rape kink"" but rather is experiencing [""groinal response""](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/symptoms-of-ocd/#TypesAndExamplesOfObsessions):

> Intrusive sexual thoughts may lead you to constantly monitor and check your genitals. This attention and the anxiety you are feeling may actually increase blood flow and physical arousal. This can make you feel as if you are aroused by the intrusive thoughts when in fact the opposite is true. Many people with this type of OCD call this 'groinal response'.",Thank you for that. OP terrifies me far less than the adoring fans in the comments that had no concept of such a complex history or reasoning behind his plain statement.,"So I decided to look through the comments of the deleted post a bit and found out that OP's boyfriend is a rape survivor.

I've heard some survivors of sexual trauma having intrusive thoughts of sexually victimizing someone the same way they themselves were sexually victimized and the fact these thoughts occur during arguments or when she decline his advances might be because that what happen to him before he was rape.

Of course this is me just theorizing, but now knowing that the boyfriend is a rape survivor himself does make me see the post differently now.","It scares me that she deleted the post with the overwhelming impression that most people thought that she didn't have anything to be concerned about. That someone would get aroused at the idea of what those people did to me, especially a partner I trust, is a fear I didn't even truly comprehend I had to have. I know my brain jumps to worst case scenarios all the time and that's on me, but even if my worries are unfounded, I wish her wisdom, courage, and safety in her journey ahead.","> I didn’t get the chance to read the post before it was deleted.

If you replace ""reddit.com"" in the url with ""unddit.com"", you'll be able to see the deleted post and comments.","Admittedly, I did look to see if you had responded to the post in your history before deciding to comment. I am an OCD sufferer and I have seen how misinformation not only harms but kills people in the OCD community. 

As a result, I made an account just for this. 

You’re completely valid in having boundaries and being unsure of the intention behind the comments as well as the boyfriend of that post. It is terrifying when we cannot know the true nature of other people. You’re allowed to not want to associate with people who have these types of intrusive thoughts. I’m just pointing out that many people have these types of intrusive thoughts. This does not mean they want to do these things, they like to think about them, nor do they even get the thoughts, enjoy them but then feel guilt about enjoying them. 

I didn’t get the chance to read the post before it was deleted. The way the comments were talking about it didn’t appear well-informed. For example, I saw a reply in the original post saying it isn’t acceptable to have intrusive thoughts of that nature and that you should get help. In reality, a well informed therapist wouldn’t give any credence to an intrusive thoughts and just treat for OCD or just tell you “a thought is just a thought”. Intrusive thoughts ≠ fantasies. This is an important distinction. 

I don’t know about the man in the post. Framing intrusive thoughts as a kink is incredibly misguided. He either is extremely confused. Or if it’s actually a kink, needs actual help so that he does not act on those urges. I must reiterate that, kink ≠ intrusive thoughts. This is generally the case, but in life nothing is certain. 

I bring up OCD,  because wherever intrusive thoughts are mentioned, OCD sufferers are sure to follow. Obsessions are often a fear that takes hold of an OCD sufferers mind. These obsessions can include contamination, perfectionist related obsessions, identity related obsessions (fear of being trans/not trans, being gay/straight), violent obsessions (fear of harming another person/yourself), and yes, even sexual obsessions (fear of assaulting someone, and those ones too). These are all common obsessions of OCD that are treated. Compulsions are the reaction to these thoughts which might be avoiding partners, knives, washing hands, checking the oven/locks, reassurance seeking, etc. 

Generally, these are completely harmless and are more dangerous to the sufferer rather than anyone around them. A person who might have intrusive thoughts about assault and compulsions related to making sure that doesn’t ever ever happen, likely doesn’t fantasize about assault as it is ego dystonic. 

I apologize for the long read. However, intrusive thoughts are severely misunderstood and stigmatized. Especially for those with OCD. The post you’re referring to needs more context so I can’t comment strongly on it. I wrote this post purely for educational purposes.","My wording was off. Limited space. Should have included ""just"" intrusive thoughts. Like that it was completely normal and the person who asked her boyfriend what his kink was said that it was raping her. And that it wasn't random. It was compelled by her actions. And that it turned into a sexual fantasy or his kink. The thought of someone thinking about raping me during an argument is almost unbearable. 

I immediately thought about if this was about children. Someone who has sexual thoughts about kids while around them but ""feels super guilty about it"" is not ok. Who would let their kids be around someone like that?? I think far fewer than would let women be around a man who thought about raping them.","Those are intrusive thoughts. They're other things too. But yes, that qualifies"

What wins in competition gets you hurt in real life.  The studio I trained with spelled it out for us. 

“Avoid fighting if you can. If you can’t, win. Winning means hurting someone. Your goal should be to put them in the hospital. Aaaaand here are a couple good ways to do that.”

And that line of thinking has kept me out of many more fights than it has helped me survive. 

And to the target audience of this sub, keep it in mind if you decide to take self defense training. Look for a school that will part this to you. Not the kick in the nuts then run philosophy.

ETA- LMAO ""doctors bias against boys"" troll","You missed the point no one is looking for green outsides, it's almost impossible to miss. Could you add a source as of why you think it's studied more in boys.  


EDIT: If you are a teacher and one kid disturbs the class to the point you literally can't continue with your class and it disturbs every other boy and girl too, then of course for the teacher the next step is to contact the school psychologists and parents in order to get the class back working. I'm not saying that teachers should ignore every other symptom or that this is the best course of action, but that is just how it is. This has nothing to do with the teachers or the doctors's bias against boys, far from it.","But the reason it is diagnosed more is it is studied more. Girls still have clear symptoms, but no one bothered to study them or educate carers on them. 

So everyone is looking for your green outsides when really they should be looking for green tongues. Green tongues are easy to spot if you bother to actually look, and know why it is important.","I don’t know where you are basing your points on. If you had a disease that would make insides of one gender turn green and outsides of another gender go green which gender would get diagnosed more? If girls also showed clear symptoms of ADHD then they would also get diagnosed as often. Again I’m not arguing about the purpose of the original post. I just wanted to clear up why it’s the case for ADHD. Not competent enough in autism spectrum disorder so not going to enter this “argument” as you may very well be right. 

Also I’m not trying to making this “boys vs girls” or anything like that just wanted to clear up some misconceptions about ADHD disgnosis rate.","That is the whole point! Women with diseases aren't studied, men with diseases are. Men with diseases are also what are written about in your textbooks.

So you are getting down voted because you are stating the obvious as a validation for your lack of care as a child. When really you should be upset that no one bothered to study female development with autism resulting in no one thinking you should even be considered for diagnosis.

Your explanation isn't flawed but the point you are making is.","That’s because boys tend to display
symptoms of ADHD differently.
Symptoms like
hyperactivity where as in young girls might not therefore it often flies under the radar with
parents and teachers. I myself
got diagnosed at 24 even though I showed all the symptoms one could. But since people
in general are not as aware or don’t believe in it, it
often goes unnoticed.

EDIT: Not completely sure why I’m being downvoted. I agree with the original post. Just wanted to clarify why males get diagnosed more as I have ADHD and have bachelor’s degree in Psychology so thought it would be an interesting fact to know. You can google it I’m not making it up."
730,"I don't even disagree on the numbers. Being informed on all of this is useful. I don't think it's a competition, though. Like you don't have to only learn about one risk, so I'm not seeing a huge value in comparing them and being like, ""this thing is worse so don't post about the other thing.""

And no worries, unless something goes horribly wrong I will not be becoming a parent. Learning how it actually works absolutely demolished the tiny ""maybe I want this even though I don't enjoy little kids, I'm supposed to want this aren't I??"" feelings I had.

I am not talking about my personal experiences, so no need to show concern for my personal relationships. 

I don't think men are monsters. But if you look at the statistics, it's a rather eye-opening picture. Men are more dangerous to women than giving birth is by far. And yet, it's funny how I'm being downvoted for saying that. But murders, rape, kidnapping and assault is typically done by men to women. 

If you have a daughter, you ought to be aware of these statistics instead of pretending they don't exist.","Oh, that's not a segue I was expecting. But, systemically, the problem does look something like this.

Individually, I cannot follow you there. I would stake my life on the trustworthiness of my husband and brother. I *did*, when I got married.

I believe men are not inherently monsters, but I also believe culture teaches many of them to be cruel and disrespectful and that we badly need to deal with that and fix it.

I'm sorry you haven't met any men who rose above their environment. It is scary being physically weaker and having to trust people who were not taught to respect you.","You want to know what's really dangerous? Getting involved with men. If you really want to find out about what can end your life, or harm you, the answer is simple: men. 

Men murder more women than anyone else. Men rape and physically abuse women more than anyone else. And no shocker here, but women serving time have almost always gotten there because of a man whom they wanted to help, or actively participated in a crime with. 

Men are far, far more dangerous to women that giving birth is.","Counterpoint: some of us didn't have any idea how dangerous/shitty all of that could be until learning about it in this sub.

I'm so glad this information is prominent here, even if it is sad to read about.","I have to agree with that to an extent. I really didn't enjoy seeing the posts about how dangerous and shitty giving birth is, as I don't think it's very supportive to pregnant women or young mothers.

731,You can keep your head buried in the sand if it makes you feel better.,"At the risk of repeating myself, I'm going to reiterate my comment because I don't think you're getting it.

You should go look at the post in question and read it. It didn't talk about any warning signs to look out for. There were no tips or any informative information about *anything*. If it had talked about any of those warning signs, or how to mitigate risks, than I would feel very positively about the post. But it was just a scare tactic. You probably still would have gone through what you did because reading it wouldn't have pointed you in the right direction for any medical advice. 

It's like me standing on the street and telling women not to walk down the dark alleyway, even if they *have to* to get to where they are going. Pretty useless.",Pregnant and people who can get pregnant need to know about the realities of what can happen. Knowing warning signs of issues and conditions can help save lives. I lost a full term pregnancy because I didn’t know the signs of an issue I developed. Not talking about the problems pregnancy can cause isn’t the solution. Not talking about it to avoid scaring women is what leads to scary shit. Edit: I also almost died during birth because I didn’t know some signs and symptoms of the condition I developed. It would have been a far different scenario if I had known to keep an eye on these symptoms and to mention them to the doc. I used the sunshine and rainbows like of my own volition. Did I say you said it? No! I didn’t so don’t get your panties in a twist.,">Acting like pregnancy is all sunshine and rainbows doesn’t really help.

Who the fuck said that? Did I ever say that? No.

 Listen, if you think that the pain of birth is glossed over, *I don't think you are paying attention*. People talk about it all the fucking time. And yes, most women in the US know that it is dangerous and can be rough. 

Yes, it can be helpful to really discuss it, and how to mitigate risks.  But that post was a fucking train wreck, with nothing but a very negative spin on giving birth, and made it sound like suicide. Sorry to break this news to you, but men raping and beating women is far more likely to happen than someone dying in birth. 

A woman is raped somewhere in America **EVERY 2 MINUTES.** A woman does not die in birth every 2 minutes. Men kill women far more than birth does.

That's just a fact. Scaring women without offering them solutions on how to reduce risk is just again, not helpful. Pregnant people have enough to worry about already without those kinds of talks that offer no real solutions.",It’s helpful in that people don’t tend to mention this aspect of pregnancy and gloss over it.

735,">It's imbalances in investment in maintaining the relationship. 

There it is, I knew you'd admit it eventually.","Relationship imbalances aren't exclusively romantic or sexual in nature. It's imbalances in investment in maintaining the relationship. The guy can be more invested perhaps because he thinks the relationship can evolve at somepoint still or he could very well be fine with just being friends in the long run and is just coping with the recent sting of rejection.

We should chastise this guy as OP did for using the toxic and reductionist term, but we don't know beyond that if his intentions were and continue to be strictly to get laid. OP clearly is still friends with this guy and wants to help him process his feelings healthily. Her post here is to not write them all off, but looking for discussion on helping folks of any gender who maybe are otherwise good folk and needs a bit of a nudge in the right direction to help them emotionally mature.

That's what good friends do, hell thats what great friends do. They help to make each other better and OP should be heralded for not writing off her friend like how you seem to suggest.

This is all of course based solely on the info OP provided, that this dude is otherwise a good dude, but just needs some reframing in how he views relationships with the opposite sex.","And there is no romantic or sexual relationship with a person who isn't attracted to her friend. His feelings and his attitude are of his own making, his own fantasies, and entirely his own selfish desires.",Strangers? There is no relationship here,">...relationships can be imbalance.


If he finds a stranger attractive and she does not find him attractive, is there an ""imbalance""? Or is he entirely and utterly responsible for his own feelings and attitude?","So it's impossible for a relationship between two people regardless of gender to change over time? That a person can be also be invested differently in each oftheir relationships?

It happens amongst same gender friends as well, for instance, one person to not know that one of their friends considers them their best friend, and it's their choice whether they can be or even wants to be that person's primary friend.

With the limited info we have here, I make no judgment of OPs friend in this instance. Imo it could very well be that he doesnt have the emotional maturity to express, and process and cope with rejection or whatever he's feeling, so he reverts to these simplistic internet buzz terms. Or it could very well be that he's an asshole that wanted to get laid. OP is right to be annoyed with her friend and she went beyond even trying to help him understand what he saying.

Friendship is a mutually beneficial relationship with or without feelings of physical or romantic attraction. Mutually enjoying one another's company and companionship is beneficial to both people.

>It's very possible that relationships evolve, and in that vein for only one side of that relationship to want it to evolve as well.

See, that kind of terminology falls in line with the toxic thinking that relationships are based on this calculated give and take, that it's a transaction. 

My issue is that friendzone used to be a legitimate term, but has since become toxic and rightfully so because of how and who was using the term. But by proxy the sociological phenomenon  associated with it has also become somewhat toxic as a result.

It's very possible that relationships evolve, and in that vein for only one side of that relationship to want it to evolve as well."

As OP said the progressive policies passed didn't have to do anything with the current government and not political party would dare to struck them down or fight them as they are the will of the people.","I wouldn't be so optimistic. At least in Mexico, the government it's left-wing only on paper. It's more like a centrist-populist. With some left leaning policies. While also aligning themselves with catholicism and the military. In other words, it's complicated. Most of the advancement in human rights have happened thanks to the hard work of activists and through the courts. The government only following through after the fact."
740,I doubted myself for a bit too. I enjoyed the conversation too so not futile. Have a good'un.,"I’m really sorry! I watched this video previously, and despite going back and seeing this warning, I somehow completely missed it that it was YouTube’s doing. I thought that you were referring to trigger warnings that this creator uses, without actually understanding you. 

This argument has been futile and my fault! :(","I was reading it as the video had been slapped with these warnings by YouTube, who were basically saying that the content may be false and may mislead the viewer in some way that would have a negative impact on society.

It may be that these content warnings were in fact general trigger warnings that were added by the creator with positive intent.

If it is the latter I retract my previous criticisms, but looking at it again it does seem to be something YouTube has added to ward people away as if the video is going to e.g. incite hatred or violence.

You then get into the query of is this similar to censorship or is it more similar to a general age rating as you might see for all movies.","I think you’re wrong about content warning being about information, but I’m not 100% sure what it is. Here are two options:

1. Content warnings means that the medium features content that may be triggering, such as Abuse, Murder, Substance use. Trigger warning is about the discussion of such, without necessarily featuring content. For example, I could have triggered a classmate while talking about abortion, without actually featuring pictures, videos, recordings, written experience of abortion. I should put a trigger warning. If I do have any of these, i should’ve used a content warning for abortion. 

2. Content warning is about a medium featuring content that elicits strong negative emotions, such as abuse, murder, substance use. Trigger warning is about a medium featuring content that might elicit a traumatic response in someone. If my discussion includes depiction of excessively harsh criticism, and a classmate has traumatic responses from experiencing excessively harsh criticism, I should have a trigger warning, but not a content warning. I should have a content warning if I depict or mention something that will make most people very uncomfortable. Think Gordon Ramsey calling a cook stupid and him freezing/crying because of childhood trauma

So when a video contains hate-speech, a content warning would mean “this video will contain depiction of hatespeech and not just mention it” or “I think that most if not all of my audience find the hate speech that I will depict as disturbing, instead of eliciting a traumatic response in only a small part of the audience”","Yeh. So this video seemed to have one that basically said ""be careful with the information in this video, it may be false"". That is absolutely ridiculous.

The ones that say ""this video touches on topics that may trigger xyz"" are a good thing.",Aah. I think I got you now,"Regarding content warnings: More or less I have no idea, but different ones. The ones calling out hatred (like this one) really shouldn't have content warnings, and there are far too many genuinely hateful ones that don't have warnings but should.

Trigger warnings are a different thing, and are absolutely fine and more videos should have them.",Are you saying “more videos should have tw” or not?
741,That is gold,"GETTIN' JIGGLY WITH IT, NAH NAH NAH NAH NANAH NAH NAH...","It is now. Thank you for the contribution. 

COMMENCE THE JIGGLY.",I didn't realise my typo until you quoted me just now and that makes it sound even more horrifyingly hilarious hahah. Like it's the name of some dick-wiggle dance.,">Do you jiggly your dick on her clit violently in the same manner that a clit-stim toy does? 


this image is both HILARIOUS and horrifying","Hahah, this is so insane! You're not wrong in that he's got the mindset of a teenager. The fact that he's insecure about the size of a toy designed for external stimulation is just so ridiculous to me. In what way would they compare, Adam?! Do you jiggly your dick on her clit violently in the same manner that a clit-stim toy does?  

OP, you have EVERY RIGHT to be mad and your response thus far is completely normal and justified. He's the one being a little bitch about everything. The fact that he views you as a living fleshlight during sex is so horrendously disrespectful.",I just bought the wand a couple of weeks ago and tried it on a couple of times when I was alone. I used it for the first time when the two of us were together a few days ago. I think he noticed that the wand is way bigger than his penis and so he got nervous.,">He then angrily asked me if my climaxing was just as important as his, and I replied by saying yes,

This question alone shows that he doesn't consider you sexual equals. He clearly doesn't consider you climaxing to be as important as him climaxing.

>He was initially fine with me using the bullet in bed earlier. A few days ago, I began using the wand and he just stopped and looked at me with a confused stare. I

Did something happen a few days ago or have you never used the wand in bed before? I don't understand why he would suddenly go from accepting your need to have clitoral stimulation to not accepting it."
742,"And why does he insist on living at his mothers house, if her actions bother him?","He eats her head off too. He can go weeks without speaking to her. He ignores her on the daily. It’s like we live there with her but not all that present. We do our own little things. His lack of a healthy relationship with his mom affected me in the past because I wondered if he would refuse to build a connection with my mom because of it. It’s super important in my family that we’re all close and happy and spend time together. He isn’t treated like a “son-in-law”, he’s treated like my parents own kid. The love and respect he receives at my place is not to be found at his.","What does your husband say when your MIL says racist things about you? This makes my blood boil. If any of my family members or friends said racist things about my SO, heads would roll.","I love him and I want this to work on the long run. But it deeply hurts that I don’t know how to be the bubbly person I once was. And now my grandma is deteriorating but the one person I want to go with me, refuses just the idea of traveling to my country. Fuck. 

I know all the answers lead to I’m unhappy. AND I AM but fuck I just want to be happy with him again. I want to live life with him. I want to do things with him. I can always do it solo but I want to WITH him, and that’s my downfall. 

I know I’m being frustrating because the answers ARE THERE but I can’t help but want things my husband doesn’t. 

I’m just feeling a lot and needed a safe place to let it out. I’m so sad.","Honey you literally just said several paragraphs about why it’s not just about travel.  

It’s not.  His unwillingness to travel a symptom of his larger attitude towards you, your culture and your race.  


There’s nothing wrong with YOU.","I think it is. But I also wish he’d spend more time with my family. Like actually learning them and being present in their lives. 

I try to build a bond with his mom all the time. She’s super mean to me when he’s at work and I’m home. I usually have to spend my free time outdoors to avoid her. I only tell him a few things at a time because I know his relationship is already so bad with his mom. 

I try not to make it worse but I’m living in hell with him just so I could be near him. 

I feel like I’m dying in order to be loved. My family means EVERYTHING to me; yet I left my comfy home to spend our marriage at his place. 

Why can’t he come and stay with my family while saving for money? It’s not like we had a traditional marriage. I stay with my family almost every other weekend. If I can handle his moms racism, why can’t he handle my family? We’re just a bit loud and have more fun at home. 

It’s the little things that have become big because I don’t see him trying for my family but I try everyday to be accepted by his mom. 

I have to hear about my dark complexion, what I can wear or not wear because “bright colors don’t look good on dark skin and dark colors also don’t look good on dark skin” 

I’m considered white in my south Asian community. I’m considered almost sickenly pale. Yet I’m getting told on the daily that I shouldn’t wear this or that. 

I try so hard to be accepted when he isn’t home. Or when he is home. I’ve just recently stopped trying because NOW when I look in the mirror, I see myself as dark and now I have an issue with it too. 

I’ve never been a colorist in 27 years of my life. Now when I lay on his chest, I’ll tell him “wow, I’ve really gotten dark” 

Fuck, it makes me cry just recalling this from the other day. Like I actually told my husband “my arm did get dark huh” 

Why have I become so disgusting.","Bare minimum doesn’t sound “great” to me. 

The problem isn’t about just the travel, is it?","In other ways.. everyday things are pretty nice. He makes sure we get to have our date nights, he’s more emotionally present and physically present when he isn’t working and home. He spends more time with me, he tries to meet my physical needs. I acknowledge all the little things he’s done for me. 

It’s just.. it’s bare minimum.. so I’m left feeling like the things I ask for more—aren’t being met. 

I’m sure he’s probably feeling discredited and misunderstood. I’m sure he has complaints about me too; but I just feel like I’m so giving and out there and I wish he’d meet me halfway."
743,"Damn, guess I need to follow some local food trucks. I need this in my life. Woefully out of the loop always.","Oh yes.  We have a Hawaiian shaved ice truck that we'd never be able to find if it wasn't for them sharing their location.  We've also found many local events because of them.  Like they'd post ""We'll be over at this event today"" and we're like, there's an event today?  Well let's check it out.","Also for all people like to bitch about social media in general, its fabulous for local businesses. I LOVE being gently reminded about my favorite local restaurants' weekly specials. Or sales, or street fairs or open studio days.","This is how I use Twitter, very curated.  Very narrowly focused on artists and cosplayers.","Honestly, I love TikTok. I keep it very curated and I get videos of people weaving interesting baskets, neat cooking tricks, this one woman who repairs loved stuffed animals, permaculture and botany stuff, an interesting guy who rants about pedestrian infrastructure failures, drag queen makeup videos. All of these sites can be horrible. Curate it for what you actually want and block what you don’t.","Eh, I'm 19 and most of my friends - even those older than me - love that app. I can't stand it...one video turns into ten then a hundred and soon enough, your whole day is gone to mindless short clips by people who don't know what they're talking about

Edit: word change","tbh I never understood the appeal of TikTok at all, but I'm probably just too old for it","I deleted Twitter and TikTok. They've been cesspools for ignorance, hate, and misinformation."
744,"That’s why twitter calls it “deactivation”, not “deletion”. Deactivating your account will not be subject to the 14 days GDPR law because it’s not technically “deleting” your account. 

In order for Twitter to actually remove all of your data from its databases you have to (a) be a citizen requesting from an EU country and (b) actually ask their customer support to delete everything. 

Source: I help manage global user data for a cloud company and have to do things differently for EU customers.","The law applies both internationally and to private companies. If twitter doesn't pledge to be deleting all user data when an account is requested to be deleted within I believe it's 14 days then it is not legal for them to operate in any EU territory and they can face a fine worth I think it's like 10% of their yearly earnings plus whatever other damages the EU court decides. 

Twitter can still be accessed from Europe so I'm fairly confident they are following this law.","not everyone, including Twitter itself, is in the EU. Also, now that it's a private company, they might just decide to keep all that data for themselves whether you delete it or not.",If you delete a tweet it's still backed up for 14 days so that changes nothing. Just deactivate the account. EU law mandates that all personal data is deleted within a certain amount of time after account deletion.,"This is not true. You have to delete all your tweets otherwise your data is still there. There are 3rd party bots that do it for you because the only way to delete tweets is individually.  Basically, you have to give the bot your login and password and it goes and runs the script. I learned this after I deleted my 15 year old account when Musk announced his intention to buy. Gotta nuke it completely otherwise he still gets your data whether you use the site or not.",Deactivating is deleting,"Hijacking top comment to ask: how do I delete my account? 

I never use Twitter but I made an account a long time ago and DEFINITELY want to delete it. Someone please give specific directions (for mobile users) because it’s NOT obvious how to do it. When I went to “help- account support” it gave me the run around. Eventually it mentioned “deactivating” the account, but I’m not sure if that’s the same as deleting it.","Nah I did this same thing a few days ago aswell. Had a friend make a tweet that literally just said ""pedophilia is bad"" and she got ratioed 5 times despite the original tweet having 100 likes from people trying to justify pedophilia. If musk doesn't actually do something that site is dead."
