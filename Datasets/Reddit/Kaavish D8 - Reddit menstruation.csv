0,Try searching period calendar,Or could you maybe send me the link please?,"Maybe it's different for different devices, cuz when I type ""period tracker"" they're all pink (and white)... But thank you anyways","Nope. Green background with white daisy, just called period tracker","That's fine, I think I found it, but it has a stroller on it and it says that it's a baby tracker app (feeding, sleep)","It is, I also just realized it does have ads on the bottom of the screen, never noticed before lol",Is it in the Google Appstore? Cuz I can't find it,"I use the Amila period tracker app.  Green with a daisy on it.  Super simple, no ads.  Not sure about importing data though."
1,"That must be so difficult for you, I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine how you‚Äôve felt over this. And I‚Äôm glad to hear that I‚Äôve been of some help!! No worries love!! üíõ","In my case, my parents would literally kill me if they found out that I've been engaging in such activities and having doubts like this bc they are bounded culturally in the traditional ways. I really really hope that I am just having a delayed cycle. Thankyou for the assurance and for sharing your experiences too! You're brave and really admirable. I won't be able to sleep tonight if not bc of you hehe. Thanks a lot!!!","Yeah of course, I‚Äôm a similar age to you and even though I‚Äôm completely of age, pro-choice as far as abortions go and my mother would be supportive- the whole thing scared the life out of me. I hope everything goes alright for you, pregnancy scares are just all apart of being someone who has periods unfortunately üò≠ Plus, like you said, you‚Äôve barely been eating and have been under stress those are the two biggest factors of delayed cycles. With the double period last month too, it‚Äôs all just pointing towards a delayed period!","I've read your earlier reply and I wanna thank you for making me feel even the slightest relief I could feel tonight. I might as well test out for myself those home tests you were saying. The reason why I was so nervous on this issue is bc of the fact that I don't want to be faced in a responsibility that I am not ready for, although I am already at age allowed to do these kind of things. 

Also, my irregular menstruation is also not helping much too. As what I've said earlier, my period occured 2x on diff days last month. I feel like I am just delayed bc truthfully, we never had penetrative sex and I've been overly stressed. But I am clouded by these perceptions and imaginations I have in mind and I still can't neglect the possibility. 

However, your words gave me a whole assurance and relief. I want to thank you for tonight!!!","Also I‚Äôd like to point out, I suffer badly with irregular periods. At the point where I forced myself to get a pregnancy test I was 2 and a half months late and I didn‚Äôt have a period until I went back on birth control - so you can imagine my worry about being pregnant. Bodies and period cycles are so so weird, being pregnant is far from being the only reason you‚Äôll be late especially since you said you had a period on the 15th of September. But ofc I can understand the worry!","Thankyou for this. It meant a lot. However, buying such testing kits here in our country is unfortunately viewed as a stigma. I wanted to do the same thing, buy the kit, test myself and have a peace of mind. However, people here in our country seems too judgmental and I am afraid of being called out in diff negative names just because I am engaging in such activities. I'm scared for that. 

I would like to ask, did your PT turned out positive or not?","Hiya love, I went through the same thing back a year ago. Honestly, most of the symptoms I had I‚Äôm convinced I made them up in my head because I had convinced myself I must have been pregnant. The only thing that helped was just getting a test, just for peace of mind. I‚Äôm in the uk and i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same everywhere but no age will be asked and they‚Äôre widely available in supermarkets.","I feel like I've been experiencing pregnancy symptoms lately (except from breast sore, increased urination, fatigue, pelvic cramps, headache), in short, I only feel NAUSEOUS and HUNGRY. And my weeks have been so dreadful for I stay up late daily, drink coffee a lot, been under a lot of stress and anxiety."
2,Thank you. Thank you for having lots of patience with me.,"Like I said in my first comment, ‚ÄúYou had protected sex. You don‚Äôt need to worry about pregnancy.‚Äù",Do you think we're good? Still can't stop overthinking about it,Random off cycles are normal. There‚Äôs no need for blood work when a period was due today and hasn‚Äôt started yet.,"That‚Äôs why I suggest a TSHus blood work. I believe you know what it is then.

I removed the old wive‚Äôs tale from this post because people like you don‚Äôt deserve to know about it. Although, OP is free to dm me. I‚Äôll be happy to help you if needed.

Les commentaires comme √ßa ne sont ni constructifs ni utiles. A aucun moment tu t‚Äôes demand√©(e) si le soit dit rem√®de de vieille femme √©tait efficace, les gens comme toi qui jugent et n‚Äô√©largissent pas ni ne cultivent leur savoir ne font rien de leur vie.

Ways to make you bleed that are not hormonal are just old wives tales. A period starts from a progesterone hormone drop that happens about two weeks after you ovulate. When you ovulate later in your cycle, your cycle becomes longer. You won‚Äôt start bleeding until progesterone drops. And that won‚Äôt happen until about two weeks after you ovulated.",How about mugwort? Any thoughts about it? It's the only thing we have in hand for some reason. Google said that it's good to induce period and such,"I'm reply grateful about telling your story. I also feel really glad bout knowing that others also have the somewhat similar symptoms and discharge before their period comes. 

At the moment tho, she still haven't gotten her period and it's still worrying us. We're only 18 and we don't get jobs in our place until we finish college. 

Do you know of any possible ways to induce or start a delayed period?"
3,"Hi there. Please reach out to me if you ever need to talk. I'm currently 9 days late and just saw this, had similar experience without the blood. 

I tested positive in Saturday and immediately negative a little while later due to it not being my first morning urine anymore. I'm waiting it out until this weekend to test again just to be sure.
I'm 26 and I know how it feels to have no family to talk to about these things. I have my husband who is my biggest support, however a friend is always nice to have in these moments.

I experienced this exactly the same in March and it was a very early rejection of the body. I am here if you need to speak üíõ",I‚Äôm trying to but it‚Äôs been almost an hour and no reply sadly. But thank you,I don't know where you are but... If you are feeling upset and you live in the US there's a number you can text to talk to someone. Text HOME to 741741 to reach a volunteer Crisis Counselor. They might also be able to help you find a primary care provider.,"Thank you for the advice. I don‚Äôt even have a regular doctor at the moment, so honestly not sure what I would do. I feel strange though, tired and sad.",Let your doctor know. If a miscarriage didn't resolve completely some of the left over dead cells can cause infection.,"I wonder that to be honest. It is possible I was pregnant, am sexually active",Is it possible you could be having a miscarriage?,"Yes, I‚Äôm bleeding to the point of needing a pad now which started a few hours before the horrible cramps. But this was a very abnormal time for me, especially the nipple changes, so I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwtf‚Äù."
4,Here is a good post that can explain in more detail: https://www.reddit.com/r/amipregnant/comments/oy9jjs/your_period_isnt_late_amipregnant_version/,thank you so much for all of the information and answers. we've been overthinking for almost 3 weeks and i'm relieved about these informations. thanks for all of your help!!,"That‚Äôs just confirmation bias. Just because none of her other friends have experienced a very normal and common thing before is just a coincidence. Late ovulation is normal. She‚Äôs not pregnant. If she‚Äôs worried about why she ovulated late, then she can speak to her doctor and her doctor can also explain that it‚Äôs normal.","out of all of her girl friends, she's the only one who has experienced this and this long delay. are there any answers to that because im really curious and still a little nervous","A period starts about two weeks after she ovulates. Ovulation can get delayed days, weeks, or months, but once she ovulates then she‚Äôll get her period about two weeks later. So she just hasn‚Äôt to wait it out.","thank you again, can i ask if the ovulation is late, how long, how many days does it take for her next period to come??","It‚Äôs completely normal to have a random off cycle every once in a while. 

You really don‚Äôt need to test again. A test is reliable 14 days after sex and definitive 21 days after sex.

 although we're both overthinkers and are really unstable when we dont get assurance so i think we'll buy just  buy one more just to be sure. thank you so much this im relieved after reading this. but why did she ovulate late?? is there something wrong??"
5,"you said your ""bloods"" came back ok?  What did they say?",also my period wasn't due I just randomly started bleeding,suffer from heavy periods has mirena put in June to help. then suddenly about two weeks ago I was bleeding suddenly a lot and clotting so bad it got dislodged. I do have uterine fibroids but they've never caused anything like this before just heavy periods. I went to hospital twice and was basically dismissed. ultrasound came back clear although fibroid on left side obstructed view of that side.,"Any chance you could fill in your relevant medical history instead of me just asking hopeful questions and you giving back one-sentence answers that shoot me down?  In one post you said you've been to the hospital twice; in another you said you've been hospitalized twice.  This is like looking for a pin in a ballroom at midnight using a one-watt flashlight, and you're behind me moving stuff, come on!","no I haven't, yes they know it's out.",Have you sent your GP pics?  Are they aware of your expelled IUD?,with the way the NHS works I get referred from my GP I don't just have a gynecologist unfortunately,"Well that's a relief.  Your OBGYN may refuse to ***see*** you, but what if you emailed her this picture?"
6,"Wait hold on this whole thread basically said hymens don‚Äôt actually break, why tf did I never learn about this?! My sex Ed classes always said a hymen ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù not stretches?!?! The word break always made me afraid of losing my virginity because then it feels like I really did lose something and that it‚Äôs definitely gonna hurt (kind of like breaking a bone). I always thought hymen=virginity and breaking that means you lost your virginity","I‚Äôm going off from what I was taught in school as a nurse, but I‚Äôll read more resources anyday. It bleeds since it‚Äôs stretched, and it can bleed more than once. Idk, there are many types of hymen so it depends on it as well. Maybe if it has multiple small holes it can break? I‚Äôll ask my teachers as well","...no that‚Äôs... they can‚Äôt tell because anything can break/stretch a hymen. I‚Äôm pretty sure I broke my hymen at like 11 riding my bike, it does not reform, this link may be very useful to you [‚Äúdoes a woman always bleed when she has sex for the first time‚Äù](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/sexual-health/does-a-woman-always-bleed-when-she-has-sex-for-the-first-time/) don‚Äôt be mislead by the title, it‚Äôs contents are about the hymen","It doesn‚Äôt break, it stretches, that‚Äôs what I mean. I remember researching it since there are virginity tests made in my dumb country, and they thought doctors could tell from the hymens. They tried with virgins and women who went through natural birth, and the results were that they couldn‚Äôt tell from looking, so it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòbreak‚Äô. It might get thin overtime tho","Ok, let me rephrase that... the hymen doesn‚Äôt reform/go back to its original state *ever*. Once it‚Äôs broken it‚Äôs broken.",Yes it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgrow back‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt go away...,I‚Äôm not sure where you learned that hymens grow back after a natural birth but that‚Äôs totally incorrect. The hymen doesn‚Äôt grow back at all. :/,"Hymens are perforated, so they naturally have holes in them. ‚ÄòBreaking‚Äô a hymen is actually those holes stretching, but considering a woman‚Äôs hymen can go back to it‚Äôs original state after a natural birth, it‚Äôs all alright! 

Tampons shouldn‚Äôt be left in for too long, I usually change it around 4-6 hours, depending on how heavy my bleeding is. I second the comment about menstrual cups tho, they‚Äôre very comfortable but it takes time to get used to it!"
7,"I couldn't do without my cup. I started with the diva cup 10 years ago, and eventually evolved to the femmycycle cup within the last 5-6 years. I've never looked back, I'd rather work with an ice cold menstrual cup than deal with a pad or tampon.",I was going to suggest a menstrual cup and then I saw this. I liveeee by my Super Jennie cup and it saves me from surprises like this. Totally get what you mean with the first insertion though.,"It's fine, really. I can't feel it after 10-15 minutes, but during that initial warm-up period is just my nitpick.","Maybe it‚Äôs placed wrong, I can‚Äôt feel mine.","Yeah, it's more about getting used to the feeling of the cup again, like there's always the initial adjustment where the cup is settling in and you can feel it for a little while before it gets comfortable. If anything, I should probably warm up my cup before insertion, that would probably help a lot with the ""*Ugh*, there's something in my vagina"" feeling.",Have you tried lube? I keep a (THOROUGHLY RINSED) small hand sanitizer bottle filled with lube with me so it‚Äôs not so bad.,"I should do that too, it's just the first insertion is like jumping into cold water. You really don't wanna do it but after you get past the hump, it's fine.","This is why I love my menstrual cup, I can put it in just in case without wasting money."
8,"Well, I guess you're not to blame for that. 
I proposed the idea a few months ago, before I started working, and she declined, because ""they're too expensive"". Apparently I missed the other part in that answer. 
So yeah... It's partly her fault for not communicating clearly and partly mine for not understanding properly. 

While we were at it, she also noted a few other things that need to be ""fixed"" between us, so I guess we'll spend the next weeks figuring out how to communicate (especially nonverbal) with each other. We're very different with that and I guess I still have to lern a lot in this field.",I'm really sorry she didn't like it after all. And I am sorry that something I suggested totally backfired for you l. I still think it's admirable that you wanted to help you friend with this and that you actually went through. I hope you two will be able to work everything out.,"Well... Turns out, she didn't like the gift at all... We had a written conversation last night in wich she told me that she lied to me with that because she didn't want to hurt me by telling me in my face that I crossed a boundary. 
So yeah... While she talks openly about her Satans Waterfall and the other problems that come with it, what exactly is going on down there is none of my buisness.
It was worth a shot.",At least she liked the gift wrapping! And you did your best! I really hope she will cash the gift card at some point.,"Well, as far as I percieved it, she liked the idea how the present was ""wrapped"" but I kind of feel, that she isn't going to cash in the gift card. 
But that's more or less my fault, because I made a small mistake earlyer and maybe messed up her birthday a bit, so I might not be at her good side right now, wich is bad:/ 
Hopefully she will not just throw it away but use it later still.","Not at all, it's fun and hilarious, but not in an over the top kind of way. Quite creative as well!

And then I'll atatch a card to the handle with ""Obviously I have no idea how any of this works, so I'd like ou to do do this test for me, so I can buy you an actual useful present"" (or something in this direction...) 
Is it tooo over the top on the stupidity?","First of all, I think it's super sweet that you're doing this! I have a few tips that might help.

The website putacupinit.com has a test you can take that recommends different options. Maybe you can subtily have her take it? (I don't know how you would do that, but at least know the option is out there).

Another tip would be to look into the Tampax cup. Tampax did a lot of resource before bringing their cup on the market to ensure most women would like it. I feel like the Tampax would be safe option to go for if you have no further information. Some companies like Saalt also have starterpacks that include all different sizes they have, this way you can try out both and see which one fits best.

I would also recommend just letting her in on your plan. I know this completely ruins the surprise, but buying a menstrual cup comes down to so many personal preferences and details. It would be better to spend money on a cup she will like than to spend it on one she won't use or that is
 uncomfortable for her. Maybe you could give her a self made giftcard that covers a menstrual cup? That way she can pick one herself and you can cover the costs. In the end it's the gesture that counts.

Stay strong sista. You got this!","Thank you very much, especially for the tips!",Great. Just make sure you have a chance to tell her (or him) all the symptoms you are feeling so she can help you feel better. I hope you feel better soon!,"Okay, I'll take your word. Thank you! I am having my next visit soon to the OB anyways. Just a follow up check up. I guess I can go on my own hopefully.","I understand. Vitamins are good. Trust your ob. But also make sure she (or he) knows all the symptoms you are feeling so she can help you understand and make the right decisions. If she doesn‚Äôt know all that you‚Äôre experiencing, she won‚Äôt be able to help you as well. If you think your mom won‚Äôt understand, you could ask your ob (or the nurse) if you could have a moment to talk to her alone. Then based on what you tell her, she can do whatever tests she thinks are appropriate. It can be tricky, but most OBs are aware of how these sensitive topics can be awkward and can create the time/space to hear you alone.","Okay, thank you for that. My OB only told me to take vitamins for now. I just don't know whether to have a test or not... And even if I want, my mother won't permit it.","If the pain is cyclic (with your cycle) then it could be endometriosis or ‚Äòjust‚Äô painful cramps. For painful cramps you can take naproxen and sometimes a medication like Pamprin will help if bloating is a problem. Hot water bottle on your belly when you curl up in bed (if you can stay home).

If the pain is more constant (I.e. not related to your periods), it‚Äôs important to have a test for vaginal infections because some can go upwards (into cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes) and cause pelvic pain and those need to be treated. Those often have a vaginal discharge. If they test for vaginal infections and it turns up negative, they can look for other causes.

They can test for those even if you‚Äôre bleeding.","They have not yet tested for other infections. Well I should have update but I am already having my pero, but I still feel pain when I am having the cycle."
14,ill try to get my hand on some. thank you very much,Just about all of them. I‚Äôm a big fan of tampax pearls.,which brands have applicators?,I would recommend getting something with a plastic applicator until you get used to the whole period world. Non applicator tampons are challenging even for an experienced person. Get a light or slender tampon and see how that works for you.," the brand is OB ProComfort, its in a plastic wrap sort of, the tampon itself is just cotton, it doesnt have an applicator",What kind of tampon are you using? Does it have a plastic or cardboard applicator?,i put my foot on the toilet and did it like that but i cant get it right. it just falls out,"It's unlikely that your hymen is preventing the tampon from going in. Sometimes tampon insertion can be painful if the inside of the vagina is dry. If your flow isn't heavy right now, fold up some toilet paper to put in the crotch of your underwear for an hour or so. Try the tampon again after a while. If you're still having the same issue, try changing the angle of insertion. You can also try some different body positions. Some people have more success with putting one foot up on the toilet rather than sitting down."
15,thank you very much for your help!,"If you can, it would help :) 

Another poster also suggested to try different positions... everyone has slightly different angles to their vaginas, so it can help to tilt your hips back or forward to find the right angle for your body.",it says normal. should i get a smaller size?,"What size is it?

Try the tampon again after a while. If you're still having the same issue, try changing the angle of insertion. You can also try some different body positions. Some people have more success with putting one foot up on the toilet rather than sitting down."
16,"I can't say for sure, but my hormones came back fine, yet my gynecologist said cortisol could still be robbing my ""hormonal milieu"" and throwing things off. I swear those hormone tests show nothing.","I‚Äôve read that cortisol could be a factor because they are exactly what I would describe as a ‚Äúsurge‚Äù. Do you know how they test cortisol levels? I don‚Äôt know much about it, but I wonder if the level is only increasing with anxiety then if I‚Äôm in a calm state and they check, then it might not show an issue.","Ugh, I feel you so much. I just didn't realize how much the anxiety was affecting me on a body level. Checking the hormones is definitely the way to go, I'd say, to start. It can't hurt. And if there is nothing wrong with those (nothing wrong with mine), it's possible the cortisol is affecting your hormones during all the surges of anxiety.","It is funny to think about the weird catch 22 and how being told my uterus was perfect would be great if I wasn‚Äôt so fucking miserable üò≠. I know you relate 100% to that feeling of wanting answers and being grateful that you aren‚Äôt dying by also wish there was something that needed to be fixed. I try to remind myself that there are lots of women out there who would love to hear, ‚Äúyour uterus is perfect‚Äù lol. 

Well now that I‚Äôve seen your post, I definitely think tackling the anxiety is what needs to be done. I‚Äôve just been trying for so long to do that, and I feel like even my psych has given up on me üò≠. I started therapy recently because I figured maybe I just need to talk and vent for an hour every other week. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs working yet, but I haven‚Äôt been going that long. 

I‚Äôve had 2 kids and my stress level/anxiety has raised significantly each time. It‚Äôs almost unbearable. I‚Äôm going to keep working with my doctors to try and figure it out, though. I think my next step is to ask my On to do another blood test to see if anything was missed. I feel like my hormones are messed up which is leading to my anxiety, my PMDD, and my heavy ass periods.","Dude, don't be sorry. I honestly have SUFFERED. I feel you SO MUCH. I laughed at the ""your uterus looks great"" bit, lol, like not funny, but I've heard the exact same thing told to me. 

I consider myself a sharp person, and for so long I was like ""Hmm, I just cannot believe that 'stress' is causing the level of period problems...maybe worsening things, but not the root cause.' As of right now, I have been proven wrong. It's just been incredible. 

Do you think maybe tackling the anxiety first could be an angle? Of course, I'm not a doctor, but that's what inadvertently helped me.","Haha before I saw this I was about to reply, ‚ÄúI think anxiety is doing everything to me üò≠.‚Äù

Yes, I‚Äôm answer-less. When I went in for an ultrasound about a year ago I told my mom, ‚Äúnot that I want there to be anything seriously wrong with me, but I‚Äôll probably lose it if I go in there and they tell me there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me.‚Äù

Guess what happened... ‚Äúoh your uterus looks great! You look perfect.‚Äù Ugh. They try the birth control thing every time I‚Äôm there, but bc makes me batshit crazy, among other side effects. They finally gave me a prescription of tranexamic acid, but it literally does nothing. It‚Äôs supposed to cut the amount of blood down significantly because it helps it to clot... but not for me. 

I‚Äôve also had blood tests galore done, but they can‚Äôt find anything there except for low iron which was actually caused by the horrible periods.

I keep seeing things about how extreme stress can make you not have a period, and I keep wishing that if the anxiety is going to stick around that it would stop my period. I guess it could be doing the opposite. 

Sorry for the long reply. I guess I‚Äôm just venting.",I guess I should rephrase: is there anything else wrong that could be causing the horrible periods or are you answer-less too (aside from stress and anxiety)?,Ugh!!! Do you feel like the anxiety is doing it to you too?
17,"It usually does, but no way to know for sure. Anywhere from 4-7 days is average.","Ohhhh I see, okay, thank you! Do you know if it will last as long as a normal period would?","A withdrawal bleed is not a true period. The bleeding can be heavier or lighter than normal. 

> Plan b makes your period come two to three days early, not an entire month

That‚Äôs not true. A woman bleeds because of a drop in progesterone. After ovulation the body produces progesterone. Progesterone is elevated for about two weeks and then progesterone drops. That drop triggers a period to start. Plan b is a big dose of progesterone. When it leaves your body, progesterone levels drop, tricking your body into thinking it‚Äôs a progesterone drop after ovulation, and you bleed.","Yes but I‚Äôm concerned about the amount of bleeding and how early my period came. Plan b makes your period come two to three days early, not an entire month.","Yeah, it sounds like the plan b worked. The info was for an in the future type thing.","Oh okay, I‚Äôm glad to know that now. But I doubt I‚Äôm pregnant, I‚Äôve been bleeding like a stuck pig","Also to add on‚Ä¶ pregnancy tests are reliable two weeks after sex and definitive three weeks after sex. So if you want to test, you want to wait at least two weeks after sex to test.","I actually took a plan b maybe four or five days ago. And since I‚Äôve posted this, last night I woke up bleeding extremely heavily nonstop. I soaked through my underwear and had to lay on a towel to bed"
18,"Yes that's what I've been thinking, that now when I've been off the pill for a year and the cycle is back in full force I just want to see how it develops and not throw it off again.

Have been looking in to vaginismus and endometriosis but since sex is just painful 2 days of the month and no problem the rest of the days it doesn't really seem like the same thing.

But oh well, will call a gynaecologist tomorrow then I'll see what happens!","It‚Äôs not good to constantly start and stop bc either. Throws you cycle off. Sometimes coming off birth control can cause extremely heavy periods or no period at all for months. 

There are many different kinds of birth control, maybe you can find one that works for you. There are also iuds. I am on something called Visanne and it works well for me. It‚Äôs the third brand I‚Äôve tried. The rest were terrible. 

I would def talk to a gynaecologist because I‚Äôm no doctor but it‚Äôs a red flag that you are struggling with periods and painful sex too. Definitely a sign of endometriosis but could be other things too. You can have endometriosis with no symptoms at all, so it does not 100% mean you have it but that is definitely a symptom you need to bring up to a gynaecologist. Good luck.","Would definietly say we're doing a lot of foreplay, 60% of the times we don't even do PIV but just licking, fingering stuff.

I do have heavy bleeding and clotting. When I take care of myself good (sleep, good food, excersize etc) my period is usually a bit better. This months period has been brutal and honestly I believe it's because I've eaten so much candy and sugar and not any vitamins etc the past month. 

2016 was the first time I tried birth control to help my heavy bleeding. The pill completely erased my menstrual cycle. I quit after half a year cause it caused anxiety.

Skip forward to 2019 when I again began on birth control, that time to help the cramps. Stopped taking them 1,5 year later, also because of anxiety.

Now I'm thinking about it again uhh.. the problem is when I am on the pill I forget how terrible my period is, and when I'm off the pill I forget how bad my anxiety is while on the pill. Which leads to this cycle of beginning and stopping birth control. It's exhausting that I can't find the right combination and solution for my body.","I also forgot to mention, are you guys using enough lube? Is he doing enough foreplay with you? Not doing these things properly can cause pain. 

There is also a medical issue called vaginismus that can cause extreme pain during any type of penetration. It causes your vaginal and pelvic muscles to involuntarily tense up and not allow penetration. If you‚Äôre not having issues with your menstrual cycle it totally could be this. Endometriosis would probably show other symptoms such as extreme pain during and not during menstruation, extremely heavy bleeding, clotting, fatigue, pain when having a bowel movement or urinating, constipation etc. 
Either way, please talk to a gynaecologist so they can find a solution for you.

Also if you‚Äôre having pain during periods and interested in birth control, I would recommend taking it continuously (skip placebo pills and go straight into next pack) it stops your period all together. I have been doing this for a year due to endometriosis and I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough to anyone experiencing painful periods, endometriosis or not. It‚Äôs changed my life","‚ù§Ô∏è in what country are you living if I may ask? 

In Finland the health care is relatively solid so hoping for the best!","I mean they‚Äôll do a pelvic exam and see what‚Äôs going on. It might not be. But if nothing looks out of the ordinary it could be. But good luck getting diagnosed and treated properly, it‚Äôs taken me 8 years to get a diagnosis üòî

and I‚Äôm still fighting for treatment.","Oh no don't say that, but yes I should check it up",I‚Äôd talk to a gynaecologist. Could be endometriosis
19,Try searching period calendar,Or could you maybe send me the link please?,"Maybe it's different for different devices, cuz when I type ""period tracker"" they're all pink (and white)... But thank you anyways","Nope. Green background with white daisy, just called period tracker","That's fine, I think I found it, but it has a stroller on it and it says that it's a baby tracker app (feeding, sleep)","It is, I also just realized it does have ads on the bottom of the screen, never noticed before lol",Is it in the Google Appstore? Cuz I can't find it,"I use the Amila period tracker app.  Green with a daisy on it.  Super simple, no ads.  Not sure about importing data though."
20,"That must be so difficult for you, I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine how you‚Äôve felt over this. And I‚Äôm glad to hear that I‚Äôve been of some help!! No worries love!! üíõ","In my case, my parents would literally kill me if they found out that I've been engaging in such activities and having doubts like this bc they are bounded culturally in the traditional ways. I really really hope that I am just having a delayed cycle. Thankyou for the assurance and for sharing your experiences too! You're brave and really admirable. I won't be able to sleep tonight if not bc of you hehe. Thanks a lot!!!","Yeah of course, I‚Äôm a similar age to you and even though I‚Äôm completely of age, pro-choice as far as abortions go and my mother would be supportive- the whole thing scared the life out of me. I hope everything goes alright for you, pregnancy scares are just all apart of being someone who has periods unfortunately üò≠ Plus, like you said, you‚Äôve barely been eating and have been under stress those are the two biggest factors of delayed cycles. With the double period last month too, it‚Äôs all just pointing towards a delayed period!","I've read your earlier reply and I wanna thank you for making me feel even the slightest relief I could feel tonight. I might as well test out for myself those home tests you were saying. The reason why I was so nervous on this issue is bc of the fact that I don't want to be faced in a responsibility that I am not ready for, although I am already at age allowed to do these kind of things. 

Also, my irregular menstruation is also not helping much too. As what I've said earlier, my period occured 2x on diff days last month. I feel like I am just delayed bc truthfully, we never had penetrative sex and I've been overly stressed. But I am clouded by these perceptions and imaginations I have in mind and I still can't neglect the possibility. 

However, your words gave me a whole assurance and relief. I want to thank you for tonight!!!","Also I‚Äôd like to point out, I suffer badly with irregular periods. At the point where I forced myself to get a pregnancy test I was 2 and a half months late and I didn‚Äôt have a period until I went back on birth control - so you can imagine my worry about being pregnant. Bodies and period cycles are so so weird, being pregnant is far from being the only reason you‚Äôll be late especially since you said you had a period on the 15th of September. But ofc I can understand the worry!","Thankyou for this. It meant a lot. However, buying such testing kits here in our country is unfortunately viewed as a stigma. I wanted to do the same thing, buy the kit, test myself and have a peace of mind. However, people here in our country seems too judgmental and I am afraid of being called out in diff negative names just because I am engaging in such activities. I'm scared for that. 

I would like to ask, did your PT turned out positive or not?","Hiya love, I went through the same thing back a year ago. Honestly, most of the symptoms I had I‚Äôm convinced I made them up in my head because I had convinced myself I must have been pregnant. The only thing that helped was just getting a test, just for peace of mind. I‚Äôm in the uk and i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same everywhere but no age will be asked and they‚Äôre widely available in supermarkets.","I feel like I've been experiencing pregnancy symptoms lately (except from breast sore, increased urination, fatigue, pelvic cramps, headache), in short, I only feel NAUSEOUS and HUNGRY. And my weeks have been so dreadful for I stay up late daily, drink coffee a lot, been under a lot of stress and anxiety."
