0,"Haha yeah! It is better to be safe and having to be dreading if the next period would ever come or not lol! I am glad you will be having orotected sex from now on and i am glad this experience gave you good lesson but nothing bad actually happened in the end! I say this because once a friend of a friend got drunk had one sex ( i dont think they pulled out though ) and she got pregnant and knew only after 2 months when 2 of her periods skipped in a row! So i was pretty shocked how she got pregnant from a single sex so we should be careful. I am not trying to scare you though!! 

Yeah i do hopeee i am good lol. I have to go buy the kit and test tomorrow!",I totally understand being paranoid we are on the same boat! I have had one partner my whole life planning on keeping it that way. I do plan on having protected sex from now on this is like a huge lesson yk? But thank you for telling me your story! I really do appreciate it if you had protected sex tho you should be good maybe it is cause of stress our periods have a mind of its own! If you ever need anything lmk!,"Woaaah congrats then for not being pregnant haha!   


I am 24 yo and i am still very worries MAYBE just MAYBE I could actually be pregnant by chance lol. Like i said the last time i had protected sex was on 28th of June. last period last day was 24th of june. my periods last 3 to 4 days max. first 2 days i see bleeding. last 1 or 2 days just blood clots and drops of blood. i fill like 2 pads max per day on first 2 days of my periods. my cycle is about 28 to 30 days long on an avg so i was expecting my periods mid of july last month but i got some bleeding only on 30th of july. the issue was the bleeding was too light! My usual period itself is pretty light but this was even lighter. I filled only 1 pad per day for 2 days. then i saw only blood clots in my urine. i didnt think much about it back then, since i was just glad i got my periods after 10 days of delay in periods lol.

&#x200B;

i was also veryyyy stressed last month, since our home was under renovation so we had to stay out and eat restaurant food for every meal which already made me feel not so good since we all know bout restaurant food. so i think this could be a reason but i am scared still. Today is my country's indepence day so i didnt go out to get the test kit but tomorrow i must! Can you tell me more about your test kit so i can buy a similar one in here and i can also reassure myself that i am not pregnant lol  


so basically my whole para was just to tell you stress can have very great effects on your body. the last time my bf broke up with me, i missed my period for a month. though my period is very scarce, i get it pretty regularly and consistently. it always comes after around 28 days and stays for 3 to 4 days. so me missing a month of my period was really weird for me when my bf broke up with me. later when we got together and had a huge fight, my periods came only after around 40 days, again due to stress. i also experience high hairlfall during these periods. so basically from my experience i can say that sex plays a pretty important role!  


Also, as a 24 yo i just want you give you a few advice lol. i am not sure if you are like me, ( Though i have protected sex all the time, and also have sex only for max 2 times a month, and check every time after he has cummed if the condom is intact and not broken i still get veryyyyyy scared until i get my next periods ) but if you are like me i highly first of all do not recommedn you to have unprotected sex at all. it has both the dangers of sti and also still potentially the danger of getting pregnant. So i recommend you to have protected sex. and try to have sex on days you are not ovulation! find your date of ovulation with those ovulation kits! my app (flo) gives me prediction about my ovulation day and the day i have high chances of getting pregnant. I avoid all those days i also add extra 3 or 4 days to the days predicted by flo lol. also, this is not something i do but if you are not from a stupid place like india i recommend you to go on birth control so you can be veryyyy sure that the probabily of you getting pregnant is less than 1%. i guess its 0.1 or 0.01 percent or something! i am not sure how hard for you to get emergency contraceptive pills or abortion pills if things actually go wrong. if those options are very hard or impossible for you to get to, i highly recommend you follow all these so you can have a peaceful sex life lol. as for me since i am very paranoid about all this, and since i cannot get a birth control pill i just decided to not hav e sex again lol.

so sorrrryyy for typing so much!!",The internet is the worst when it comes to implantation bleeding thankfully Reddit has people with the same experiences! I did just take another test clear blue is a company name for a pregnancy test and they are 99% accurate i did it with my first urine this morning came out negative! Thank you so much I am a 17F so I know my body is still changing I have been stressed with colleges etc so I’m not sure if it has to do with that,"Okay so I had a similar issue as well. I am 24 yo and I had protected sex with a condom on the ssme day you had your last sex. It was the last time i had sex too. I had my last periods a week before that. So i was expenting my next periods in mid of july but i did not get anything until 30th of july. It was quite lighter than usual and had blood clots in it. I was soooo scared this could be something called an implantation bleeding that happens when implantation occurs. 

So i went all over the internet trying to find out what even this bleeding is supposed to look like. Aparently it is supposrd to be just some spotting which is either pink or brown. Many websites mentioned it usually does not have clots. Also the max days before which implantation can occur after having sex from my research online is about 15 or 16 days. 

You mentioned your first bleeding is about 1 month after your unprotected sex so i guess the chances of it being kmplantation bleeding is less. But i dont know the reason for this bleeding as well!

And now you are again having some more bleeding. I am honestly not sure what this means but you being pregnant is actually very unlikely. Also the clear blue test you mentioned, i am sorry since i am from india i dont know what that actually is? Is it the company name or a specific kind of test? 

Even if you are pregnant, you have been pregnant for long enough to get oretty accurate results in your HcG tests. I guess that clear blue test you did is an HcG hormone test for urine. You have taken this test 1.5 months after having sex and i guess you if you are actually pregant right now you should probably be at the oeak of your hcg hormone since it declines only after 12 weeks. So if yourr urine test showed negative, it probably means it is negative. But to calm yourself down i recommend taking a few more in a few days of time gap early in the morning with your first urine.",Okay so last time I had unprotected sex was June 28th maybe that was the last time I had any type of Intercourse then a month later I got a weird inconsistent flow of a period bright red blood brown blood a little bit of pink for like one wipe that lasted that lasted July 22 to July 27th including two spotting days one in the beginning and one at the end. Now two weeks like August 11th - 15th I have had blood clots medium flow red blood little bit of burgundy blood in the first days I did take a clear blue digital test and came back negative,Actually can you tell me when you had your last sex and what kind of protection you guys used and how long after you had this bleeding? Basically can i get more details lol and i shall give you info based on my experience,Is a blood test more accurate he never came inside of me he always pulled out before and finished off with his hand
1,anytime!,"Hopefully. I'm not too worried that she's pregnant at this point because given the last time we had sex, her period would have to be earlier than usual to be able to get pregnant (given the ""fertile window""), which she's said it's absolutely never early. Plus given that she was sick it would make even less sense. I just would like her to get on it obviously. Thank you for all your input :)",yeah genetics play a significant role in that. I don’t know what’s gonna happen as mine’s still pretty irregular. Hope she gets this sorted out :),"Fair enough. My girlfriend is only in her mid 20's so I'm not sure how much of a difference it makes, but anyone can be irregular. Seems like after Covid especially which is good to know","i mean i’m a teen and got my period less than 2 years ago, so it’s normal for it to not be regular yet. Mine was always regular tho since i first got it until i caught covid. After that it has been very, very inconsistent, so covid definitely had an effect on it",Wow! I'd tried to read up a little bit about what it could potentially do but it's good to hear about first hand effects. My girlfriend has had a history of not having completely regular periods either so this could definitely throw it off,it did! i skipped mine actually. Got it 40 days after my previous one. After that they were very inconsistent. Got it in march and it still isn’t regular,"Out of curiosity, those of you who had COVID, did it delay your periods? My girlfriend is two days late for her period and I'm not worried (yet), but I think it could be explained that she not only got COVID, but she got it pretty hard. She wasn't hospitalized, but at times she complained of trouble breathing, and had an awful cough (she still hasn't shaken it despite being negative), plus a lot of body aches. I'm worried that she seems to have not even had symptoms of a period yet. She complained on Saturday night that her skin was starting to break out and that happens before her period comes, but as of Monday she has no other symptoms besides a zit or two, not even cramps or just general sickness. If it's Wednesday and she isn't on it I'll be freaked out but for now I'm just curious of your guys' accounts

Edit: As of Friday, five days late, she's on it. I'm relieved"
2,"Ovulation tests don’t even confirm ovulation. They just give a heads up when it *might* happen. They are just very easy to use. Temping will confirm when ovulation happened, but it’s not as easy because you have to be consistent with taking your temperature as soon as you wake up and before you get out of bed. Some people would rather pee on things than remember to do something the second you wake up. But temping is much more accurate and reliable than ovulation tests. 

You can read about temping here, and there are more resources to read linked in the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/wiki/temping/","Oh, I never realised how easy it is.. I really wish school would teach these things because when I googled it most that came up was ovulation kits. Thank you very much for your help",All you need to track ovulation is a digital oral thermometer and the app Fertility Friend.,"True, it's just all the other times it started early that was unusual and i took the vitamin c (a lot less at the time). I supposed I assumed the effect carried onto the next month. But if it's true that it can delay a period then that's a big relief. I did notice a sign of ovulation starting a bit late since I never really get much discharge to see if I am ovulating. I can't exactly access an ovulation tracker atm, but it is something I have considered for the future.","It’s completely normal for cycles to vary. Plus you said your period came early and you didn’t take vitamin C. You can’t pick and choose the data that you want and propagate it forward. Studies have actually shown that vitamin c can lengthen a luteal phase by a couple days of there is a vitamin C deficiency, which will actually make a period come later.

If you want to know about your cycle, then track ovulation.","Ok, thank you

It does seem like a big coincidence that my period started to start earlier with the vitamin c though. I just hope it comes soon","If you didn’t have unprotected sex, then you don’t need to worry about pregnancy.",So there's no possibility that I could be pregnant?
3,Then you have nothing to worry about,We always use protection and he always pulls out before he cum and ejaculates with a condom on.

7,"If your icky time is bad that means your hormones are not balanced. It’s a disorder if you experience any mental differences or physical differences like pain. Through research it’s actually really bad for even healthy people to go through it monthly anf it’s much more healthy to do it every 3 months. It’s really really hard on the body and hormones can still be balanced over a longer cycle, they’re just stretched out more. If you’re having no symptoms of a disorder like pain or mood you’re perfectly healthy and this is your body doing what’s naturally better for itself. Many people when they go on vitex, a herb that balanced hormones, only have icky Erinyes every 3-6 months because that’s what’s healthier. If you look at other species their cycles are generally much longer too, every 3-12 months.

17,"What the fuck is “dressing as a boy?” This is exactly what I’m talking about. The trans movement is inherently regressive. It takes us right back to the ‘50’s, where boys wear pants and girls wear dresses and if you’re a boy who likes pink you’re somehow a “secret transwoman” (aka egg, yuck I hate that terminology). Also it’s absolutely not the minority anymore lol. I’m not saying that every single trans woman is like this but it’s becoming more and more prevalent. For every trans woman who actually has gender dysphoria and grew up truly thinking they were in the wrong body, there’s ten of these pedo-lite misogynistic fetishists who get off on being treated like a “woman” (aka degraded).

> gender as a tool of oppression


Gender is a tool of oppression used by the patriarchy to control and keep women under submission.  Gender is socially constructed ideals under patriarchy for how men and woman should behave and be treated based on their sex. Gender is the found in gender roles and femininity. It's what says women need to be quiet, submissive, to be caring. It's what says that women aren't as smart as men, that women are too emotional. It says that real women should wear make-up to make themselves more attractive to men. It says that women's biggest goal in life is to bare children. Gender is what kept women out of leadership positions, working, owning land, and being heirs. 



When the trans community says that gender exists, they are saying that these sexist regressive stereotypes that harm both men and women are innate in the sexes. They are saying that because they don't adhere to the ""innate gender"" that they aren't that gender they are the other gender. Thus reinforcing the idea that socially constructed gender is not socially constructed and instead is actually innate in both sexes and cannot be abolish nor can women or men be liberated from it's constraints.



By admitting that gender is harmful and not innate in the sexes, we as a society can fight to eliminate this ideology so that men and women can behave however they would like.",How tf is being trans a tool against women?

20,"What everyone is arguing is that men aka males do not have periods, transmen are female.

Pretending periods are not a female thing and ignoring how women are still oppressed and shamed for it does not help women/females, the opposite actually.

Since when do scientists define gender? Science defines sex, gender is a social construct that fluctuates through time and culture.

25,"> Trans people for example are accepted in Olympics since 2004/2005 and never won a single gold medal until now.

Technically accurate, but misleading in reality. They were allowed to compete *if they had gender reassignment surgery.* The vast majority of trans men do not have GRS. Currently, about 1/3 of trans women get GRS, and that number would have been substantially smaller even just 5 years ago. Effectively, the Olympics policy barred 75%+ of trans people. The surgery restriction was only dropped in 2016, meaning we've had a single Olympics where any meaningful number of trans athletes could compete.","THIS is the problem. ""Women's issues"". Who the hell said that being a female only has bad side effects? Also, you saying that males have more testosterone and this makes them, quote: ""stronger, etc than us"" is one of the things that pisses me off. Because this is used to invalidate women's works and hobbies. Two people strength can only me measured by gender if those two people are the same size, the same weight, the same genetics and the same amount of training. I know women who are incredibly taller and stronger than guys, or just trained on a academy. This can't be used as a argument to separate women from man. Yes you as a feminist may be using this to say that """"females"""" should have separate and safe spaces, but man use the same argument to say we can't practice sports for example. 

Also the word woman will never be only associated to human adult females because since it was invented it was also associating a hundred different types of personalities to it. Also for what the hell is gender really important today? For real, biologically speaking. What difference does it makes to you? Trans people for example are accepted in Olympics since 2004/2005 and never won a single gold medal until now.","Gender is a social construct and is tied to the idea of what actions and behaviors a woman SHOULD exhibit. I don't want to do away with the word woman, I want the word woman to evolve into what it should convey, an adult human female and nothing more. The word ""woman"" doesn't mean someone who like dresses and makeup and frilly things and is weak and who wants to stay at home and take care of children. Yes, men have more testosterone than women. That makes them stronger, etc, than us. It isn't testosterone alone that separates us, but yes it is one thing. I still don't understand your argument.

Edit: Yes, i agree women's issues are not studied enough...yet.","No. This means we should contest and doubt if biology is getting properly studied. Also, let ""men claim to be women"", if being women or men is social construction, this means anyone can claim to be any of those. I'm not confusing, I'm just sick of being oppressed by garbage arguments. Males for example always used the testosterone argument to validate them acting violent and aggressive towards other people. Now having a movement that uses this as a excuse to make women and man segregate each other is not being practical in any way against these oppression. Theoretically?

You're confusing as fuck.","""Biological facts"" wait!!! The same biological facts who throw """"""female"""""" opinions on garbage because we are ""overly emotional, physically weak and hysterical"" (which by the way is the worst slur you can use against a woman)? The """"""science and biology"""""" you love so much is molded by white cis straight conservative males and they use everything on it everyday to validate their misogyny. What you call biological facts I call bullshit that was poorly studied and described a way to invalidate everyone who has a pussy. For years biology was used against women to make them feel too dumb to even state their opinion, for years we had scientists saying that we were hysterical during our PMS and our opinion should never be considered. There is a lack of studies on how estrogen and progesterone affects behavior, and way too much studies on testosterone because the majority of scientists are testing just to validate their misogyny and soften up man's guilty because ""testosterone can cause violent behavior!! it's normal if man are aggressive"".

27,"> Since there is science behind transgenderism, there are ways to prove who's real and who isn't.

""Science"" here means self-reports from the person claiming to be trans; this is how the vast majority of mental health diagnoses operate. It's not a particularly scientific process, particularly in an era where anyone can research what psychologists look for online (and before the internet, trans people passed around that kind of information by mouth.) Nobody is doing brain scans as part of the diagnostic process for being trans. Brain scans are sometimes done in research, but that's a totally different ballpark from diagnosis and the research itself is very mixed.","The point I'm trying to make is that there can be instances where a real trans person is being purposefully misgendered because the bully is trying to get a reaction from the trans person. That's harassment. It's like when certain LGBT+ people purposefully misgender trans people like Blaire White solely because they disagree with her (because she's not leftist enough to be, by their definition, actually transgendered). Or in the case of families not supporting their transgendered person, they may purposefully misgender to belittle and subdue that family member. Among, of course, other things.

I don't think misgendering is the biggest deal, but if it's in a mix of other verbally abusive words, that is harassment.

Well, a mental health check, a brain scan, a look into family history and upbringing should help decipher whether or not Yaniv and people like him are truly trans or just a sick pervert.

I don't personally believe he's trans but it doesn't exactly matter: a pervert is a pervert no matter how you slice it. It's just a matter of how law enforcement deals with it: if they don't want to touch it because they don't want to appear transphobic, then there's clearly a problem here. But if they can see past it (which, fortunately, Canadian law enforcement did), then it's slightly less important. But only in regards to how severe and obvious the offense is. If it's minor but still a problem in society, police are less likely to sniff around.","Calling a woman she or a man a he isnt really purposely misgendering.

Regarding suicide: to be misgendered a handful of times while the person is attempting to transition socially and/or medically and they clearly don't look to be the opposite sex yet but they're trying, and the misgendering is accidental, I agree with you that it's kinda insane to kill yourself for that.

41,"She’s advocating for schools to be more understanding of young women sometimes needing time away from school during particularly bad menstrual cycles. I don’t think that’s synonymous with  not advocating for girls’ pain to be taken seriously. I see it the opposite, if schools could recognize how much of a problem it actually is that necessitates time off here and there, it could highlight the actual severity of the issue. Thinking OP’s opinion is the equivalent of not advocating for proper diagnoses is very black and white thinking..
 
I don’t think you’re understanding when I say I’ve had my fair share of bad periods and I have no underlying conditions. Other people with an actual diagnosis may not even experience a period that bad, point is everyone is different. But that doesn’t mean the woman with a horrible period shouldn’t get checked out.

I have friends with reproductive disorders, others with none. The level of suffering during our menstrual cycles will still vary, however. I’m going to disagree with you here and say for many, it’s normal. Unpleasant and unlucky, but still normal. Many other cases to the same degree can also be NOT normal.",">I don’t think OP is trying to negate the experiences of women with actual reproductive health disorders.

But they are.

> But it is normal for women with perfectly good health to have some pretty debilitating periods, speaking from my own experience and a lot of fellow women I know. No PCOS or endometriosis on my end, and I have had some catastrophic periods. 

Most women with no underlying conditions don't have debilitating periods. There's a crisis of underdiagnosis in gynecological disorders, especially endo, where it takes anywhere from 4 to 20(!!) years to get diagnosed, depending on the symptom(shortest for infertility, longest for chronic pelvic pain **DESPITE 70% of female CPP sufferers having endo**).

>Birth control methods like Paraguard can cause a horrific period too..

I have a copper IUD as well, have had it for over 4 years now. Day 2 of the period consists of 10-minutes waves of debilitating pain for about 8ish hours where I can't walk and need to curl up to see straight. If I need to be functional(job, exam, important class, sleep) I take painkillers, otherwise I power through. I know this is my choice and many would choose the painkillers. Having a metal stick rammed into your uterus is an underlying condition.","I don’t think OP is trying to negate the experiences of women with actual reproductive health disorders.

Of course they're capable and in an ideal world they should be expected to do so. But we don't live in an ideal world. Mankind will not be our ally; they remain our enemy. The sooner one makes their peace with it the sooner one can get to the actual fight and abandon futile diplomacy. 

Men won't start valuing women or stop feeling entitled as **they have nothing to gain and their superior status to lose**.","I grew up and live in the east coast of USA. 

I disagree with you that American culture emphasizes women only be housewives. At least that perspective is outdated. That concept began to die well before women’s liberation and civil rights in the 1960’s and 70’s. Granted there are regional or religious sub cultures that do have a greater emphasis on “a women’s place is in the home to serve the husband and kids”. But mainstream culture for the most part expects girls to become independent women. 

Granted misogyny exists in a lot of ways but feminism and gender equality is a thing. The U.S. is very large and each state has its own laws and regulations. Some states criminalize abortion which infringes on the autonomy of female/women citizens. Then there are some states that better fund free medical care and sex Education for young people by having free clinics with birth control options attached to a public high school. 

It also depends on your own personal experiences, the way your were raised and how you see yourself in the world.

Quality of life improves for everyone when girls and women are valued as whole people  

All the Men and boys, and girls and women in my life are for sure feminists even though American society is still oppressive in many ways our institutions uphold white supremacy/racism, the patriarchy/misogyny, and capitalism exploiting it all. 

That oppression is unwelcome more often than not when people become aware of how systemic oppression impacts their families and communities. The fight to dismantle a very effective oppressive system is difficult. Education organizing and advocacy/ activism is essential for everyone to engage in. How is dependent of the form of oppressive system you live in","I grew up in a westernized country. That classmate immigrated from eastern Europe. You think your culture is different but in America there's an even stronger expectation of women to be **only** housewives, where I'm from they're expected to work full-time both inside and outside the household. 

And yes, girls don't live in a vacuum. That's the main issue. Girls grow up in a system that actively seeks to enslave them to their male peers. Boys and men will never value girls and women as nothing but slaves, it's just not beneficial to them. We must fight for ourselves without expecting their support.","We are not from the same country and culture. 

Where I am from there is not such thing as homemaking days or not going to school to do house work. Granted their children who care for their siblings outside of school. But it’s against the law for girls and boys not to be educated, that’s why there are public schools available to anyone. 

So the context for our understanding of and experiences with the patriarchy in education are bound to be different vary our perspectives. Cool! 

More power to you to fight for your education, financial independence, and your sense of self. Do what makes sense for what is true to you. As always be careful and I stand in solidarity with you to be revolutionary and create the space you and others needs to be fulfilled and self sufficient. 

I encourage to continue to reflect on how the patriarchy impacts everyone ( girls, boys, women, men, non binary, gender fluid, young, old, sisters, brothers, daughters, sons, moms, dads,) how do people react to the benefits and privileges afforded to men/boys, to the disadvantages laden on girls and women. 

Girls and women don’t live in a vacuum, we live in a world where everyone exists together so the patriarchy continues until boys and men also value girls and women. And the laws and policies of our societies also value the genders and sexes equitably. 

Good luck","If girls are allowed to stay at home during their period, the patriarchy will excuse this to give them ""homemaking days"" - I've seen it with a classmate of mine who got leeway for missing school since she was a fresh immigrant, the 50% of the year she missed school she was caring for her younger siblings and doing housework. Since nobody gives a shit about female pain, this will be the reality of every girl except ""only"" for 30% of her schooling. 

We can't restructure the system yet, we don't have the power. We have to push women to not only succeed but excel in a system stacked against them to prove to women trapped in the patriarchy's webs that they have a cause to rebel in order to gain it. Because men won't give a shit even if every single girl was scoring straight As when the average boy grade was a C- and all learning methods were male-focused to compensate; they'd just resent girls for overachieving. So we have to keep fighting no matter what.","I partially agree with you. 

I am talking about the space still needed in education that allows for each student and teacher to be treated as a whole person. For their needs to be considered in their education as a part of what they need to help them learn. 

Male female. Early childhood or higher education. We all need wellness days (physical or mental/emotional) and we shouldn’t be penalized for having our needs met. 

the patriarchy and misogyny negatively effect both males and females. And obviously disproportionately more so negatively impacts women and girls. 
So yes education is key for independence and self sufficiency for all people.  

But no one is ENCOURAGING girls to stay home during or bc of their periods.

The point is girls should not be PENALIZED for menstruating. They should not be penalized for taking a day WHEN THEY NEED IT because periods can be physically taxing especially if you have some undiagnosed medical condition that causes extreme pain, fevers among other things. But girls and women are expected to power through discomfort and implicitly taught to not listen to their body. It’s problematic and detrimental to everyone.  A girl experiencing uncomfortable and painful periods is not going to learn very well in the classroom during that time anyway.  We need to restructure the system to accommodate young women, so there wouldn’t be a risk of falling behind academically.

I guess I wish for a society that does not demonize, revere, exploit and diminish girls and women experiences with their own bodies.","Because academic achievement is a requirement for higher education and/or practical training.

And they are a requirement for women's financial independence.

Every girl encouraged to stay at home during her period runs a higher risk of growing up not earning enough to fend for herself."

Thanks for your input though.","Yes it hurts a little bit . But that's just like a pinch I feel.  Comparing to pads and tampons I will always recommend cups because they don't hurt or create any problem once inserted. They don't cause rash and also we don't have to worry about the leak.

I change the cup quantity every 12 hours now and I don't mind managing a lil bit sting.",I am absolutely sold on the cup idea. I have the safecup...

46,"Probably, I don’t think I’ve ever had to go so badly in my life! 😂",No idea. Another mystery of the vagina. Maybe the pelvic floor was really excited to help you expel the urine.,"It was half dry, half soaked... really can’t explain why that happened that one time!","Yes, I am very well acquainted with my pelvic floor, and that has never happened to me. The only time a tampon has ever fallen out of me involuntarily was when I sat down to pee and it was unbelievably soaked full of blood. Otherwise there is no possible way for my tampon to come out without me removing it with my hand. Maybe I have a pelvic floor of steel. It's possible, I'm an opera singer.

I'm only speaking from my own experience, like we all do every time we comment on newbie period posts... kinda sucks that people feel the need to downvote me for doing that... rant over.","A very short vagina, you mean? Can't quite get my head around the physics of a tampon being low enough to get wet by pee. It would fall out of me if it was that low as it would have to be literally hanging out of me to get wet. Maybe I have a vagina like a bucket. Is your uterus inverted? Either way I'm glad you're not using them if they were actually absorbing urine as that can't be hygienic for your vagina.","Sorry, this is gonna sound patronising and I apologise, but why did you think your tampon got bigger when you peed? The pee does not pass through, next to or indeed anywhere near where your tampon is inserted. It's a whole different hole. The only unhygienic thing about it is that you might pee on the string. I've been wearing tampons for 20 years and have never had to take it out to pee. I think you were probably inserting them incorrectly, as you mentioned you may have been. Removing them every 45 mins would practically cause chafing - far too soon/dry. Glad the cup is working out for you.","When I first had my periods I used to have really bad pain when using tampons because I didn’t realise how to put them on straight... aside from the fact that I’m an idiot, I would say wearing a cup is much more comfortable.

My periods are really heavy and I usually need to drink a lot of water or I feel quite faint, which means I pee a lot. When you pee with a tampon on the tampon can absorb it and grows bigger. Believe me when I say this is either comfortable or practical. Changing a tampon every 45 mins is not a good idea either, as the bottom bit gets wet but the top bit doesn’t and it can hurt if you pull it out when it’s still dry.

When I started using a menstrual cup my life changed.  Cups weren’t around when I first got my period, but life would have been SO much easier.
I would recommend a few things when buying it:
- don’t go for the cheapest option. I’d say a €20 should be reasonable. Cups last years (I still use the first one I ever bought 6 years ago!)
- look for the right size for you, cups will have their specs online and you then know what to buy.
- buy a soft one. I have a harder one and a contractable one which is much softer as it folds into this tiny circle. I find the second one more comfortable to insert and remove cause it’s very soft against my walls.
- ensure you keep it clean. Use soap and water when ever you have access to a sink and you’re removing it. Once you’re done with it at the end of the month, boil it. You can buy a microwaveable case which makes life easier.
- cups are leak proof as long as you wear it properly, which can be tricky to manage at first. When you put it in (there are hundreds of videos online explaining how) and you feel it’s completely secure, pull a bit. Do you feel some resistance? Good, that means it’s sealed against your walls.
- be carefully when removing it, specially if you have long or fake nails. I’ve accidentally pinched myself instead of the cup and it hurt a bit, but nothing tragic.

Let but not least, give yourself time. Some people are naturals with their periods, and some people (like me) take ages to figure out what works. Wishing you all the best!!

52,CIS,"You can’t acknowledge both biological differences and accept that males with a trans identity are women! They are diametrically opposed ideas.

Transwomen do not “have a seat” at the table of womanhood. They are not women, they are males. They are also seeking to encroach on our spaces snd places at women’s expense. Women are being reduced to body parts and body functions to accommodate their fragility! Bereaved mothers being referred to “birthing parents”, women being referred to as “vagina-owners”, or “person with a cervix”, people who need abortions FFS. It is deeply dehumanising and robs women of our right to name ourselves. 

They are demanding access to our sport - despite overwhelming evidence of risk of injury and unfairness to females. 

There are multitudes of examples where are just expected to budge up at our own expense, to accommodate some bloke who reckons “womsnhood” is just a feeling in his head, or he’s watched too much porn (Julia Serrano and Andrea Lung Chu - who say exactly that, in their published works).

Far too much is being demanded of women in the name of gender identity. And women are saying “no”. The UK women have defeated gender ideology, and many other jurisdictions have women mobilising and pushing back also. 

And seriously, I’ve asked you to stop using “cis”. It’s not a word, it an offensive mechanism to further oppress women.","I did not refute the biological differences of men and women or that women largely have very different physical needs and capabilities.

I did not suggest that recognizing trans women would end sexism or oppression of women and girls.

So what exactly is your point?

In any case, trans women are not to blame for female oppression and their existence does not minimize the impacts of being born with a uterus. So I don’t really see your point— are you saying trans women aren’t women because they aren’t born with a uterus and therefore have not “earned” womanhood through physical struggles and oppression? Are you saying that because I think trans women have a place at the table, then I must not have the slightest idea of what it’s like to be a woman? Excuse me while I clean my period stains off the sofa for a moment.

I don’t suggest we ignore any biological differences. In fact, that was my original point in this thread- trans women aside, there is no all-encompassing definition of what female bodies are “supposed” to do, because all bodies will react according to demographics, health, and external stimuli. And in my opinion, saying “oh, your body is supposed to do blah blah blah” ignores all these factors.

You mention female oppression and you seem to suggest that trans women can’t be women because they aren’t born into it. But women are born into such varying degrees of privilege all around the world. If a woman is born into a progressive and affluent environment where she is able to excel alongside her male peers within her education and career, and decides not to have a child while facing minimal judgement, does she not have the same claim to womanhood as one who has had to overcome sexual trauma, pressure to have a family, deprivation of education, or endless violent sexism within her community? I agree that no matter what, being a woman has implications and affects how you are perceived. But that degree is much more severe for some than others. So, at what point, are you more or less of a woman?

Acknowledging trans people does not inherently mean ignoring physical differences between the sexes. If it did, there would be no such thing as a “transition.” I also think it requires insight into the striking differences of the conventional male and female brain. I think those differences are so poorly understood- one might hear, “women are nurturing and men are good at math” or something, but it is so much more than that. Those differences exist on a spectrum, and pretending they don’t doesn’t do favors for anyone.

I don’t suggest that every time you describe yourself to someone, or look in the mirror, you should have to use the word “cis.” I think it’s fine just to say, “I am a woman” and leave it at that. Seeing trans women doesn’t make you a subset in your own category. I only said “cis” because someone very specifically made a comparison *to trans people.* If you are having a discussion about trans couples, it is appropriate to have vocabulary for categories that in most other contexts we would assume as default.

Personally I do not think it is more dehumanizing to refer to myself as “cis” than as “a female”. I definitely have female anatomy, no issue there... but I am not a specimen being commentated on in a National Geographic documentary. Neither are “males.” I only bring this up because we are having a discussion on language, though. And, while I think it’s worth a mention, I’m not telling you words like “female” or “male” are immediate threats to my place and dignity as a woman, nor am I going to tell you not to use them.","Cis is offensive. Males are not part of the female category. 

If I am not the sum of my uterus why are women being referred to as “uterus-havers” or bleeders or vagina-owners then? It is absolutely dehumanising to be considered based on body parts or bodily functions. But having a female or male sexed body is not something a person can just ignore, it has real, material impacts on how we exist in the world and in society. Women have been oppressed for millenia due to the reproductive capability of our sex class, whether we reproduce or not. Males of the species are, on average, faster, bigger and stronger, they are also the violent sex (towards women, children and other men), that is just a fact. Women do have particular needs due to our biological sex, that men simply do not have - menstruation, pregnancy, breastfeeding, post partum needs, incontinence, menopause etc. Simply pretending these differences don’t exist does not end discrimination, exploitation or oppression of women and girls. 

Females are the sex that are trafficked, prostituted, married off as children, suffer FGM, aborted, deprived of nutrition, medical care and education, simply by virtue of our sex. We perform the vast majority of the world’s labour - reproductively, domestically, emotionally snd even for work (globally women perform 60% of work done outside of the home, yet only earn 10% of the income). Being female has implications for the way we move in society - our lives are heavily restricted compared to our male counterparts, girls (even in safe countries like Sweden) move around far less than their male peers. Even in such things as health care provision, our health issues are far less likely to be taken seriously, and it takes far longer to receive a diagnosis, our pain is routinely dismissed and minimised. 

Our sex has a profound influence on our lives, I find it remarkable that you appear to have little understanding of this.","I didn’t say it was wrong to suggest a body is “supposed” to work a certain way, I just said it merits discussion.

I think the comment above was just suggesting that while perhaps appropriate in this situation, saying someone’s body is “supposed” to do something shouldn’t be generalized as a solution for comforting a self-conscious partner, because their body might not always work as expected.

Anyway, it looks like you agree that it merits discussion because you’ve really engaged on this topic!

If you can’t accommodate others then you are fragile. “Trans fragility.” Please, you are the one offended by the word “cis.” Let’s just assume trans fragility is a thing— that wouldn’t mean your own fragility isn’t.

I don’t understand why women, or anyone, feels disenfranchised by the existence of trans people. 

Biology does not epitomize your humanity, your womanhood or anyone else’s. I don’t know about you, but I don’t let my uterus decide what should be offensive to me or others, not is it the sole determiner in what I believe is important.

It is not uncommon for women to not have periods for reasons such as prolonged stress or athleticism, and while that should prompt a visit to the doctor, it certainly doesn’t define them less as women and doesn’t even always signal an alarming issue. Actually, halting your period is what your body is *supposed* to do to conserve energy and withhold ovulation in these situations.

Let’s also not suggest that women who have periods are of “child bearing age.” Many of us have periods between the ages of 8-12... do you still suppose that’s the defining point where women and girls are of child bearing age? Is that really when you bEcOmE a wOmAn??? Could it be that maybe the language you use, as a woman, also has its own limitations and consequences? Do you think that because you were born with a vagina you are except from saying anything incorrect about the state of womanhood? Are you reeeeally being oppressed as a woman if someone does so much as to say the word “cis?” 

I will use whatever words to address other women as I have the right to, as do you. I said nothing vulgar or derogatory. I said “cis” because *you* brought trans people into the context of the thread. I think that when you say someone’s body is “supposed” to do this or that, there may POSSIBLY be a connotation associated with “supposed” that suggests in order to be a woman, your body must be ABC. Honestly before you mentioned trans people, I wasn’t even thinking of them- rather I was thinking about cis, er, biologically born women who miss periods or don’t have them, for whatever reason. But *you* made it about trans people. But okay.","Don’t use “cis” with me, it is offensive and dehumanising to insist males with a self-declaration of a trans identity are women. Women are NOT a subset of their own sex category. 

And yes, a woman or girl having her period is normal, it is what female bodies are supposed to do. If you are of child bearing age and not having a period, unless pregnant or taking contraception that halts your period, there is a problem and you need to see a doctor.

Men need to get over it. And the trans brigade need to stop rewriting language and being so demanding of women and girls to make accommodations and subjugate their own needs and language to cater to trans fragility. Biology doesn’t give a toss about queer theory.","I think you can chill though- I don’t disagree, but trans couples aren’t “extraordinary” (as opposed to straight cis ones) and the language we use about what bodies are “supposed” to do at least merits some discussion.",Oh come on! It’s an intimate moment between an ordinary heterosexual couple - not everything is about trans.

Literally why are you here apart from to cyberbully teenage girls","The way I see it, if you are a girl who has periods, and you know you won't want to swim on your period, honestly, don't join the swim team. You're there to swim competitively, whether you're on your period or not. You knew what you were signing up for the day you joined.   


I'm very much in real shock at what I see on this thread - so many girls who let their periods stop them from living full lives and being active. I swam, I played tennis, I rode horseback, I went hiking, I did anything I wanted to and my period never stopped me.   


Maybe that's what girls need to see - women who get out and get active no matter what time of month it is.","Suggesting a solution to leaking during swimming is not OPs issue and I’m afraid responses like this will come across as dismissive to OPs actual situation, however thoughtful the message","Someone on here recommended a cup. I would too. I've found it's an absolute game changer, and I wish I'd had cups available when I was in school (I'm 51 now).

I had a similar issue when I was a restaurant hostess but it had to do with my severe migraines, IBS, and panic attacks. I ended up getting fired bc I was sick with a migraine one day. I was super dizzy and couldn't stand up. The nausea and pain was horrendous. And my boss had no sympathy whatsoever. But I'm glad I got out of there.

Just pls don't get yourself fired.

I was also like the favorite employee and they still fired me.",Exactly 😭 thank you so much. You’re right that I probably shouldn’t have blown up on my boss like that.,"People aren't taking into consideration that OP likely has irregular periods. Mine were like that where sometimes they would come after a month and a half and then other times ot would take 5 months. Irregular periods are a real struggle and OP likely didn't realize she was going to get her period.

And don't even argue with ""well she should've recognized the symptoms beforehand."" When mine were very irregular (I'm on birth control that has helped mine) I would sometimes get false alarm PMS symptoms.

While I do agree the boss honestly did nothing wrong and it's just a stressful situation all around, I'm tired of how people are acting like OP should've known ahead of time. Periods don't always work like that.

I was taking too much at one point, it's only because my PT and I were talking about nutrition and supplements at one point ages ago, and the subject came up, that I found out. it's really easy to do!","Thank you for that, looks like im probably taking about twice the recommended amount. I think I was under the false impression I would just pee out the excess.","Having enough magnesium in your diet has many health benefits! I take it too, to try and help my sleeping.

Please be careful though not to exceed the RDA. Overdosing on magnesium (and any supplements, really) can be a bad thing. Read more [here](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-magnesium)","If I understand what I read correctly, the magnesium could be doing a few things. Your body needs it to move so it could be relaxing the uterus, and giving it what it needs to not cramp up, or it could be inspiring your body to produce/balance out a hormone you need to not cramp. I really hope it helps you too","Thanks for the detailed response! Justt coming off my period, so I got 3 weeks to replenish my magnesium💪🏻","most importantly I take a non laxative ""gentle"" version, according to my research (and do you own, there have been several clinical studies) don't do magnesium oxide. I started off with oxide and it worked but major tummy ache problems. Either way for $15 per month its absolutely worth the experiment if you experience intense pain like I did, I take 2 pills twice a day I think 800mg per day, probably overkill but im extra paranoid about pain.","Ooh I want to start magnesium, thank you for reminding me! What strength do you take, if you don't mind sharing?","I feel like I have ptsd from mine, so much pain that when I was little I literally wanted to die instead of getting it again. Another woman on here recommended I take magnesium every day, and I can't believe it, its drastically changed my life. I still get tired and bloated but I can go to work/function now. Definitely don't find periods empowering, but im glad other woman do."
60,"You know, i’m not expecting to it take shortly. I’m just here to share my opinion. I’m well aware that people will still be bitchy about it.","that may take a while. I have a aversion to all waste material and surprisingly a form of germaphobia were im just scared of toilets rather then the germs.  


for people similar to me that may be hard and for me personally it will 100% be impossible. But I wish you luck.","Yeah, and that’s my reason of posting things about our periods (of course i didn’t post used tampons or pads). To normalize that, periods are natural cause. I can understand if someone has hemophobia, but if they find periods disgusting because it comes from girl’s parts then this is why we’re here to normalize it.","people consider periods disgusting.   
Blood by itself is disgusting to some people.  
strands of bodily tissue are disgusting so even more people.  
Hearing about a person suffer is disturbing to alot of people.  
Some people dont want to hear about another's painful experiences.  


  
Put it all together and I can see why they consider something that effects all women(Who people feel are weaker more then just biologically due to sexism of the past) and is usually kept behind closed doors compared to a life long very visible affliction that is been at the receiving for a long time. Youve never heard mainstream comedy about periods but you here dick jokes everywhere.","They are both normal human things and you have kind of funny moments with them sometimes. I didn’t say people differentiate them, but when you post something about how your first period started for example, everyone’s like: “wtf post something normal”. But i’ve seen hell a lot of memes about boners and everyone seems to be fine with it. That’s my experience with TikTok.","to be fair boners and periods aren't similar. I can see why people differentiate them.  


That doesn't make saying ""post something normal"" because you don't like someones video fine though. Good on you for blocking rather then having a internet argument though.","That’s why i tried to join that trend, because it’s pretty normal to talk about periods. My main goal was to get this video go viral, instead i got kids commenting under that vid telling me to post “normal things”. But if you post something about boners, no one would get really mad. So if i posted something about that, i’m sure i wouldn’t get immature comments. But like you said, i could’ve got the wrong public.",Tiktok actually has a lot of videos about periods that are sharing awareness. I think you just got the wrong public. Give it time it should get better
61,That sounds like something to try thank!,"Yikes... I knew I didn't have the heaviest flow but mine still seemed heavy before. Cups are an amazing choice!! Some women who haven't had luck with cups have had luck with discs, and you can get flex or softdisc (the same company, the same thing) to try out without a subscription at Target!",Lol try soaking through Ultra tampons in 2 hours. Maybe cups could be a good choice??,"When I used tampons and pads I thought I had a heavy (not the heaviest but still heavier than average) flow. I'd go through a super plus tampon in 4-5hrs on my heaviest day. I wear my saalt small 12 hours and no overflow. All other days off my cycle I barely reach halfway. Either my tampons sucked bad or my period has gotten lighter since I started using a cup. I know it's helped my cramps and skin sensitivity down there. 

Take the PACII quiz! And saalt has a duo pack if you're on the fence about what size to get!",I’ve used the Diva Cup before and I had to wear pantyliners with it on heavy days due to residual fluids. Wonder if the three cups you’ve mentioned are better for people with heavy flows 🤔,"Yes. The divacup is rarely the perfect cup for someone. Lunette, Saalt, and Lena are good starter cups.",Are they better than Diva cups!?,"I hate that, hence why I got a Saalt cup after a learning curve it's wonderful."
62,Fair enough,Right... Well I'm happy to agree to disagree with you on this :),"Again i get what you mean that food isn’t TREATMENT medicine, but studies show it can be PREVENTATIVE. Thats why i agreed at least partially","Why do you think food is medicine? You've said you get what I mean but it seems a bit contradictory if I'm honest.

If you have an infection, eating food won't cure it- antibiotics will. 

If you are in an immense amount of pain- food won't cure that either.


Cancer...? Food won't cure that I'm afraid!","Actually food is medicine, preventative medicine is not focused on enough because it doesnt make money. Ive even seen some doctors admit this. 

That being said, i get what you mean.","My point being this list is a bit silly. Drinking peppermint tea won't work, and not eating a specific food won't. Your uterus contracts which means it'll be painful. No amount of changing what foods you eat/don't eat won't change that 😂

FOOD IS NOT MEDICINE.",Its things that reduce cramps,This is the dumbest thing... How about we just let people eat what they want when they are on their periods? 🤷🏼‍♀️
63,Glad to hear that ♥️♥️♥️,"Mmm a little bit complicated, but I got used to it! ❤❤❤",That must be hard to deal with I’m sorry!,"Yes, can easily bleed without lots of care.","Oh no! I’m so sorry to hear that 

Does sex irritate them?

I have scars on my cervix from a gyno butchering me","Oh, I hate them but had to surrender to the fact many years ago. Can't use internal products because I have many scars in there and my doctors suggested not to use them.","I used to say that too. It’s worth looking into the research more if you haven’t already.

Plus the waste you’re saving! 

If it’s because periods gross you out, then I don’t know what to tell you besides it’s natural and I’m sorry you feel that way.",Can't.
64,"I’m so glad it worked out for you :) things like this suck so much. I heard birth control messes with hormones too, so that’s even more sucky",I was worried too. But it worked out in the end and I'm positive it will for you too,"Thank you! omg I could never deal with being two months late. Even if I didn’t do anything, I would probably still be so worried",Makes sense. I was the same way up until June (which ironically is when i stopped birth control.) Hopefully you get it soon! Last year u was two months late and they had to put me on birth control to get it back,"just to reassure me, since I got really anxious over not getting my period yet :)",I'm confused on why you took the pregnancy test if you didn't have penetrative sex?,"yep I didn’t! alrighty, it’s just concerning that it’s already the end of the month, and I still don’t have my period yet.",So you did not have penetrative sex? You’re late because you ovulated late. Wait it out.
65,💜💜💜💜Tysm😁😁 You’re literally so amazing!💜💜 I am so lucky to have found you☺️😊😁😊🧡🧡💜💜,Youre most welcome kiddo. I've learned that women can usually fix their own problems and sort things out if they just have someone to talk to that can listen to them without judging. Quite different with boys. So if you ever have to talk to someone and you don't want to tell your parents just message me.,"You’re so right 💜 It’s not to overreact, but Thank you so much. You are one of the reasons I’m not worried about my period anymore☺️😊🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩😁😁😁😁🧡🧡🧡🧡💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜","No it was rough for a while but we're past that now. We can sit on the couch and cuddle like we used to when she was little. But she didn't want any part of that for about 10 years. I think the time between 13 to 18 is the hardest for every single girl, after that it gets much easier. I mean the whole world is changing: your body is changing, your feelings are changing your relationship to your Mom and Dad is changing, how boys look at you is changing, even how your girlfriends -your best mates- look at you is changing and it's very uncomfortable.  There's new rules that you have to follow that didn't exist just the year before, that's difficult too.","Sorry, what I meant about the teens was like what you see EVERYWHERE - teens RUN AWAY from their parents' hug haha. But I won’t be like that. I’ll love my family No matter what 💜 Sorry if I was offensive! I really didn’t mean to 😊 Bye 🤩🤩","Haha 😂 Thank you so much, though 💜 I’m sure your daughters love you so much. You’re such an amazing dad. Unless they’re teens, haha! Have a lovely day x 😁😁😁😊😊😊😊","Yaay!!!  Good for you sweetheart.  Dont be afraid. In this about half of humanity are your sisters. 
And this will be harder on your dad than on you.  😂",Edit: I am on my period and I talked with my mom about it 🙂 She’ll help me through it💜
66,"If your icky time is bad that means your hormones are not balanced. It’s a disorder if you experience any mental differences or physical differences like pain. Through research it’s actually really bad for even healthy people to go through it monthly anf it’s much more healthy to do it every 3 months. It’s really really hard on the body and hormones can still be balanced over a longer cycle, they’re just stretched out more. If you’re having no symptoms of a disorder like pain or mood you’re perfectly healthy and this is your body doing what’s naturally better for itself. Many people when they go on vitex, a herb that balanced hormones, only have icky Erinyes every 3-6 months because that’s what’s healthier. If you look at other species their cycles are generally much longer too, every 3-12 months. And new research (yes Iv read them) from universities is showing it’s healthier for our bodies to do it less often and even better- not at all. Your body is healthy and happy right now.","I would rather suffer through a bad period and have my body and hormones be regulated as it's directly linked to mineral and nutrient absorption, thyroid, gut health, etc",Why would you want you cycle back? I’m trying to get rid of mine with every herb anf medication under the sun but now hysterectomy is my only option as Iv been begging doctors since I was 18. you’re Incredibly lucky not to have such an awful thing happen to you every couple weeks,Thank you so so much!! I appreciate this immensely. I just want my cycle back,"When you get to 90 days without a period, your doctor can prescribe you a medication to induce a bleed and hopefully get you ovulating regularly again. But you’ll want to test 1-2 times a week until you get your period or a positive pregnancy test. You can buy a pack of bulk hcg tests off of Amazon so you don’t have to spend a ton of money on drugstore pregnancy tests. I like Wondfo.",I'm not trying but have had unprotected sex a few times a week since July,"So the negative tests mean you aren’t pregnant from sex more than 2-3 weeks before the tests. But it’s always possible you could become pregnant from sex you had more recently, if you ovulated in the few days after sex. A test is reliable 14 days after sex and definitive 21 days after sex. 

Are you trying to get pregnant?",2 days ago
67,"Absolutely! I felt really hopeless in finding someone to sterilize me, but then I found r/childfree and the list they have. I was sterilized in March of 2021, never pregnant, unmarried, no history of BC usage, etc.",Omg thank you so much!!!! This information is literally a lifesaver. I’m going to call my insurance about it then bc I’m wondering if the doctor office was just lying bc they didn’t want to perform the procedure on me. I do live in a southern Republican state who dosnt gaf about womens productive rights so wouldn’t be surprised if shady doctors did that sort of thing.,"r/childfree has a list of open minded doctors who perform sterilization procedures on those who are younger & without children.

Per ACA, insurance plans must cover at least one method of sterilization. Unless you’re on a plan that was grandfathered in.","I’ve been trying to get sterilized but it’s been very hard finding 1, a doctor to do it bc of my age & not having kids and being married. Or it’s so expensive I can’t afford it","Of course. If you and your husband don’t want children, sterilization may be worth consulting a doctor about. Either one or both of you.

I would also consider reaching out to a counselor or therapist regarding your fear of pregnancy. It’s valid, but may become irrational.",I’m really paranoid when it comes to pregnancy. I have a irrational fear of becoming pregnant. My husband has been told he most likely will never have kids and I have some issues but I’m still scared. We always use condoms and pull out method but I still get such bad anxiety. Which since being on birth control it’s helped my anxiety about getting pregnant but the side effects are awful. My fear was never this bad until the Roe vs Wade overturned and now I feel like I’m crazy for being so scared/anxious. 🙁 I do have female condoms but have never tried them. I think I’ll try that next and talk to my doctor about the birth control and see if maybe I should stop or if there’s something else I’d be comfortable with. Thank you sm!!!,"Non-hormonal methods would include the copper IUD, barrier methods (male condoms, female condoms, diaphragms (which must be used with spermicide), spermicide, withdrawal, FAM, and sterilization. Many people opt to combine non-hormonal methods, like using condoms and withdrawal together.","Do you by chance know of any non hormonal birth controls? I don’t want the IUD (idk if it’s hormonal) , or the depo, or the pill, and I don’t know how to put the one disk thingy in. 😭 I feel like I’m never going to find something that works 🙁"
