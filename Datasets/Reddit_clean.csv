so, it works, but it works by kinda coating your vaginal vault with an intense drying agent, which hinders *any* natural lubrication from arousal. my take on it is that the product could create more friction and a dry sensation that could make a  feel tighter, but that is all it is. on that front, it seems dangerous for use with unprotected  as the risk of internal abrasions go up. also, i could not for the life of me figure out how it could be pleasurable.
so it isn't exactly snake oil, but it is harmful. i think the folks who use it are more interested in the concept of an unaroused woman vs a ""tight"" one. in some cultures, female arousal and signs of it are shamed, so this product might come in handy to someone trapped in that scenario with a male spouse who rejects ""wetness"".","we know the wife of ben shapiro doesn't get wet.

i've heard that people who try to control their partner sometimes create issues that don't exist. for example, my friend said whenever her ex was in a bad mood he'd say her hair smelled bad. she was so paranoid that she began washing it twice a day and buying sprays for it. she asked her family and colleagues if they smelled anything, and nope she didn't smell at all. in fact, her hair began to thin and break from all the washing and sprays. she lost tons of confidence. now she has a complex about smelling bad despite showering multiple times.
it's all a way of creating a sense of dependency because you start thinking ""no one else would take me if i'm so gross"".
not only the fact he brought her to a doctor! that's like him exerting a parental type control on her!

so, it works, but it works by kinda coating your vaginal vault with an intense drying agent, which hinders *any* natural lubrication from arousal. my take on it is that the product could create more friction and a dry sensation that could make a  feel tighter, but that is all it is. on that front, it seems dangerous for use with unprotected  as the risk of internal abrasions go up. also, i could not for the life of me figure out how it could be pleasurable.
so it isn't exactly snake oil, but it is harmful. i think the folks who use it are more interested in the concept of an unaroused woman vs a ""tight"" one. in some cultures, female arousal and signs of it are shamed, so this product might come in handy to someone trapped in that scenario with a male spouse who rejects ""wetness"".","we know the wife of ben shapiro doesn't get wet.

so it isn't exactly snake oil, but it is harmful. i think the folks who use it are more interested in the concept of an unaroused woman vs a ""tight"" one. in some cultures, female arousal and signs of it are shamed, so this product might come in handy to someone trapped in that scenario with a male spouse who rejects ""wetness"".","we know the wife of ben shapiro doesn't get wet.
