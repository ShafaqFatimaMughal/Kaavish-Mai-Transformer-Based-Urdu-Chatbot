"Sure! There are hormones that are involved and those are estrogen and progesterone. Levels of estrogen and progesterone are typically at their lowest. This causes the top layers of the lining to release and leave the body. After ovulation, this involves the Secretory Phase, that occurs from ovulation until the start of the next period. The uterine lining gets ready to support a pregnancy or to break down for menstruation. In this stage, progesterone rises. This causes the uterine lining to stop thickening and prepare for a fertilized egg. These hormones rise after ovulation and are highest during a period. Blood vessels shrink and the uterine lining breaks down. The uterine cells produce less of these chemicals if pregnancy happens.",Can you tell if hormones play a role in the menstrual cycle?,"Take care, bye","No, bye","No problem, do you have any more questions for me?",Thank you for answering my questions,"Okay so before Ovulation, this cycle physically changes the uterus.

"The first stage is the follicular phase. It starts from the start of the period until ovulation.Throughout the menstrual cycle, there are multiple follicles fluid filled sacs containing eggs at different stages of development in both ovaries. The period ends about halfway through this phase. One follicle in one of the ovaries becomes the largest of all the follicles, called the dominant follicle and is the size of a grain of sand 12 cm. This follicle is the one prepared to be released at ovulation.

The uterine lining gets ready to support a pregnancy or to break down for menstruation. In this stage, progesterone rises.

"After ovulation, this cycle is Luteal Phase. It occurs from ovulation until the start of the next period and lasts about 14 days, but between 9 and 16 days is common. After ovulation, the follicle that held the egg turns into something called a corpus luteum. It makes the hormones progesterone and estrogen to support pregnancy. If pregnancy does not happen, the corpus luteum breaks down between 9 and 11 days after ovulation. Else, progesterone supports early pregnancy if an egg and sperm connect.

"The vagina is the tube between the vulva and the cervix. This tube is the connection between your uterus and the outside world. The vagina is what babies exit through during birth, and what menstrual blood exits through during your period. The vagina is also used for insertion, such as with a penis, fingers, female condoms, sex toys, tampons, or menstrual cups.The vagina can also act as a route to other parts of the body. During penisvagina sex, ejaculate is deposited in the vagina, allowing sperm to enter the uterus through the cervix. The walls of the vagina can also be used as an administrative route for medications and contraceptives, such as intervaginal hormone creams, the hormonal vaginal contraceptive ring, or vaginal suppository medications.",What is a vagina?,"That is a nice question, a lot of people don't know that vulva and vagin are two different parts.

This shape change happens as the uterus and cervix are drawn higher into the pelvis, which creates more space and moves the cervix farther away from any semen that is ejaculated into the vagina. This allows time for the semen to mix with female genital fluids, stimulating the sperm to undergo the physical changes necessary for fertilizing an egg",I am curious of how my vagina private part changes during sex

One study that tracked women as they transitioned into menopause found that menstrual irregularity began on average between ages 47 and 48. But it can begin much earlier or later.
