The uterus is a hollow muscular organ located in the female pelvis between the bladder and rectum. The ovaries produce the eggs that travel through the fallopian tubes. Once the egg has left the ovary it can be fertilized and implant itself in the lining of the uterus.,I was wondering what uterus looks like,"The ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands located on either side of your uterus. They produce and store your eggs (also called ovum) and make hormones that control your menstrual cycle and pregnancy. During ovulation, one of your ovaries releases an egg. If a sperm fertilizes this egg, you can become pregnant. Your ovaries continue to release an egg each menstrual cycle until you reach menopause.

"Before Ovulation, this cycle physically changes the uterus. 
This is the stage where menstruation happens and it happens during the period – from the time vaginal bleeding starts to the time it ends. Blood from the previous cycle  from inside the uterus is shed through the cervix and vagina. The uterine lining, called the endometrium, is thinnest during this phase. A typical period may last up to 8 days, but on average lasts about five or six.

There are hormones that are involved and those are estrogen and progesterone. Levels of estrogen and progesterone are typically at their lowest. This causes the top layers of the lining to release and leave the body. After ovulation, this involves the Secretory Phase. The Secretory Phase is rom ovulation until the start of the next period. The endometrium (uterine lining)gets ready to support a pregnancy or to break down for menstruation. The cells of the lining make and release many types of chemicals. In this stage, progesterone rises. This causes the uterine lining to stop thickening and prepare for a fertilized egg. Prostaglandins, “PGF2α” and “PGE2”, cause the uterine muscle to cramp. These hormones rise after ovulation and are highest during a period. Cramping helps start the period. Blood vessels shrink and the uterine lining breaks down. The uterine cells produce less of these chemicals if pregnancy happens.",I am not sure if I understood what a uterine cycle is,"A menstrual cycle starts on the first day of the period and ends at the start of the next period.

"Following are the phases

Follicular phase. It starts from the start of the period until ovulation.Throughout the menstrual cycle, there are multiple follicles (fluid filled sacs containing eggs) at different stages of development in both ovaries. The period ends about halfway through this phase. One follicle in one of the ovaries becomes the largest of all the follicles. It is called the dominant follicle and is about the size of a grain of sand ( 1-2 cm or 0.4-.8 in). This follicle is the one prepared to be released at ovulation. For most people, the follicular phase lasts 10-22 days, but this can vary from cycle-to-cycle.

The hormone active here is the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) which is produced in the pituitary gland (a small area at the base of the brain that makes hormones) . FSH tells the ovaries to prepare an egg for ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary). The dominant follicle produces estrogen as it grows, which peaks just before ovulation happens.

"Periods fluctuate for a while after they first start. But if you’ve had your period for a few years, it should generally be about the same length and volume each cycle. You may still notice changes from time to time, though — the heaviness and length of your period depends on your hormones, which can fluctuate. Hormones can change temporarily because of things like stress, over-exercising, diet, or taking an emergency contraception pill.  Your period will also have variations if you don’t ovulate each cycle—you may miss a period, or it may come later than usual, and/or be heavier or lighter and shorter or longer than your usual.

Don't hesisate at all because that is what I am here for. ,Can I ask you general questions regarding periods?,"After ovulation, this cycle includes the Luteal Phase. The luteal phase occurs from ovulation until the start of the next period. The luteal phase lasts about 14 days, but between 9 and 16 days is common. After ovulation, the follicle that held the egg turns into something called a corpus luteum. It makes the hormones progesterone and estrogen to support pregnancy. If pregnancy does not happen, the corpus luteum breaks down between 9 and 11 days after ovulation. The hormone involved is progesterone which supports early pregnancy if an egg and sperm connect. If no pregnancy happens, progesterone will peak and then drop. These hormonal changes can contribute to common premenstrual symptoms. Common symptoms are mood changes, headaches, acne, bloating, and breast tenderness. A drop in progesterone and estrogen causes menstruation.",What happens after ovulation?,"Following are the phases

Follicular phase. It starts from the start of the period until ovulation.Throughout the menstrual cycle, there are multiple follicles (fluid filled sacs containing eggs) at different stages of development in both ovaries. The period ends about halfway through this phase. One follicle in one of the ovaries becomes the largest of all the follicles. It is called the dominant follicle and is about the size of a grain of sand ( 1-2 cm or 0.4-.8 in). This follicle is the one prepared to be released at ovulation. For most people, the follicular phase lasts 10-22 days, but this can vary from cycle-to-cycle.

The hormone active here is the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) which is produced in the pituitary gland (a small area at the base of the brain that makes hormones) . FSH tells the ovaries to prepare an egg for ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary). The dominant follicle produces estrogen as it grows, which peaks just before ovulation happens. "

"Cervical fluid is produced by the cells of your cervix. The cervix is the opening to the uterus from the vagina. Cervical fluid can change throughout your cycle from thick, creamy, and sticky to thin, wet, and slippery.

" A few days before and during ovulation, it will be clear, wet, slippery, and stretchy. There is a lot of cervical fluid during the days right before ovulation.

"It’s common not to have heard about bacterial vaginosis (BV) until you notice an issue with your own fluid and start googling. BV happens when the normal balance of vaginal bacteria is replaced by high numbers of anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that don’t need oxygen to grow). The most common type of BV-causing bacteria is called Gardnerella (don’t confuse it with the STI gonorrhea if you see it on your clinical report). The digestion processes of the new bacterial community create different byproducts and environmental changes, which can lead to symptoms from a fishy or unpleasant odor to itching, discomfort and inflammation. An immune response is also triggered in the vagina and can degrade the vagina’s naturally protective mucus. This can make the reproductive tract more prone to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like HIV and chlamydia.

An immune response is also triggered in the vagina and can degrade the vagina’s naturally protective mucus. This can make the reproductive tract more prone to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like HIV and chlamydia. 

",What is Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)?
What are the causes for bacterial vaginosis,"Bacterial vaginosis is commonly seen in women of reproductive age, although the disease is not limited to any age. The prevalence of BV varies widely amongst demographics, and is tied to sociodemographic characteristics including race, ethnicity, education and income",How common is this?,"While BV doesn’t usually lead to health complications, untreated BV can sometimes lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, infection after gynecologic surgery and pregnancy complications including miscarriage and preterm birth",Can untreated BV lead to complications?,"In many cases, the most significant impacts of symptomatic BV are emotional and social. This is especially true for people whose BV is recurrent (having it multiple times, despite treatment). One study found that, depending on the severity and frequency of symptoms, BV can lead people to feel “…embarrassed, ashamed, “dirty” and ""very concerned"" others may detect their malodor and abnormal discharge”. It can affect a person’s self-esteem and sex life, and they may avoid sexual activity (especially receptive oral sex) altogether. Recurrent symptoms, without an understanding of the reason, can be frustrating and make someone feel out of control.",Are there any impacts of bacterial vaginosis other than on your body?,"It’s common not to have heard about bacterial vaginosis (BV) until you notice an issue with your own fluid and start googling. BV happens when the normal balance of vaginal bacteria is replaced by high numbers of anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that don’t need oxygen to grow). The most common type of BV-causing bacteria is called Gardnerella (don’t confuse it with the STI gonorrhea if you see it on your clinical report). The digestion processes of the new bacterial community create different byproducts and environmental changes, which can lead to symptoms from a fishy or unpleasant odor to itching, discomfort and inflammation. An immune response is also triggered in the vagina and can degrade the vagina’s naturally protective mucus. This can make the reproductive tract more prone to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like HIV and chlamydia.

"The exact causes of bacterial vaginosis are still unclear. Vaginal homeostasis can be disrupted by both internal factors (ex. antibiotics, diet) and external factors (ex. soap, semen), but it isn’t fully understood why one person gets recurrent BV in a particular situation when another doesn’t. Prolonged or irregular uterine bleeding may also be a contributor. This may happen because uterine blood changes the pH of the vagina to be slightly less acidic and/or because red blood cells provide more opportunity for lactobacilli to be carried out of the vagina. Recurrent BV may pop up around the time of menstruation for the same reason. The use of hormonal contraceptives in general, including “the pill”, has been shown to have a protective effect against BV.

Sexual activity is also associated with a higher risk of BV. Specific risk factors may include new or multiple sex partners, a lack of condom use, vaginal intercourse and receiving anal sex before vaginal intercourse without a new protective barrier",What are the causes for bacterial vaginosis,"Bacterial vaginosis is commonly seen in women of reproductive age, although the disease is not limited to any age.

"Vaginal bacteria can sometimes get out of balance and then improve on its own. To prevent BV, start by limiting your risk factors.

"The hormone estrogen helps to keep the vagina moist and to maintain the thickness of the vaginal lining. Atrophic vaginitis (vulvovaginal atrophy) is a common condition that can occur when the ovaries produce a decreased amount of estrogen, which includes the prominent symptom of vaginal dryness.

At the time of menopause—then it is classified as genitourinary syndrome of menopause
After having a baby, particularly if breastfeeding
Medications which interfere with reproductive hormone regulation, such as those which treat breast cancer or certain gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists.

"Before you get your first period, you might notice changes in your:
Nipples/breasts: Changes to your nipples and breasts may be the first thing you notice. In the beginning, the small bumps around your nipples become raised. Then, the darker area of your nipples will get bigger and start to puff out—it might even feel like there is a little lump on your chest. These are called breast buds. This can happen on both sides at the same time, or on just one side at first. If it happens on one side, it can take up to 6 months for the other side to catch up. 

Most people first get their first period 2–3 years after their breast begin to grow. If your breast buds start to grow around age eight or nine, it may take closer to three years for your period to start. If your breast buds develop later than most people in your class, like when you’re 13, it may take less than a year for your period to start.  

Pubic hair
After breast buds, you may notice the first signs of pubic hair. Just a few long hairs may sprout up at first. You’ll grow more pubic hair with time, and that hair will get curlier, thicker, and spread out towards you thighs. 

There is a chance you’ll see some pubic hair before your breasts start to grow, but most people see it the other way around.

You probably won’t see any hair under your arms until around the time your period begins, or just before that
The shape and height of your body will also be changing around this time. By the time you notice breast buds, your whole body will have already started growing more quickly. 

Body shape: Your body’s shape and size also change quickly before your period starts. Your biggest growth spurt may be about six months to a year before your first period (this is the case for most people, but for others, it can be just before, two years before, or even after a first period). If you’re tracking your height, and you notice it changes fast and then starts to slow, your first period may be on its way.

Along with changes to your height and weight, it’s also normal for the size of your pants to get bigger as your hips widen. Some parts of your body will become fattier and rounder, while other parts stay the same. You might notice this begin around the same time your breast buds start to grow. 

The whole lower area of your abdomen is called your pelvis. Your vagina, uterus and ovaries are in there, and also grow in size. The exact timing of your body’s growth will be unique to you.

Vaginal/cervical fluid: Sometime after your breasts start to grow, you may notice a change to the fluid in your vagina, and it may feel a bit wetter than before. Some people will notice this about 6–12 months before a first period. It will likely be a thin, whitish liquid, and won’t have much of a smell.

"Many of the changes you may be associating with your hair throughout your cycle are due to the changes in oil production from your sebaceous glands. Since sebum (oil produced by the sebaceous gland) and the hair follicle exit from the same opening in the skin, the hair and skin surrounding may be coated in sebum. One study had an interesting finding: even if more bad hair days were registered around the time of menstruation, they did not correlate with increases in scalp sebum levels. There was not a clear explanation for the bad hair days—perhaps it’s due to a difference in participants’ personal perception of their hair. Is the change on your head or in your head? Interesting right?

Some hormonal contraceptive medications (like chlormadinone acetate, a synthetic progesterone which provides anti-androgen activity) may also affect hair and skin quality. In one study of people taking these medications, participants had decreased sebum production and improved perceived hair quality.

Sebum production is influenced by your hormones, particularly androgens (like testosterone). Sebum production often ramps up greatly during puberty, often being produced at high amounts between the ages of 15 to 35, as assessed on the skin. Estrogen also influences sebum production, especially at high doses. ",How does my hair change during periods ,"Before you get your first period, you might notice changes in your:

This can happen on both sides at the same time, or on just one side at first. If it happens on one side, it can take up to 6 months for the other side to catch up. 

Most people first get their first period 2–3 years after their breast begin to grow. If your breast buds start to grow around age eight or nine, it may take closer to three years for your period to start. If your breast buds develop later than most people in your class, like when you’re 13, it may take less than a year for your period to start.  

Pubic hair
After breast buds, you may notice the first signs of pubic hair. Just a few long hairs may sprout up at first. You’ll grow more pubic hair with time, and that hair will get curlier, thicker, and spread out towards you thighs. 

There is a chance you’ll see some pubic hair before your breasts start to grow, but most people see it the other way around.

You probably won’t see any hair under your arms until around the time your period begins, or just before that
The shape and height of your body will also be changing around this time. By the time you notice breast buds, your whole body will have already started growing more quickly. 

Body shape: Your body’s shape and size also change quickly before your period starts. Your biggest growth spurt may be about six months to a year before your first period (this is the case for most people, but for others, it can be just before, two years before, or even after a first period). If you’re tracking your height, and you notice it changes fast and then starts to slow, your first period may be on its way.

Along with changes to your height and weight, it’s also normal for the size of your pants to get bigger as your hips widen. Some parts of your body will become fattier and rounder, while other parts stay the same. You might notice this begin around the same time your breast buds start to grow. 

The whole lower area of your abdomen is called your pelvis. Your vagina, uterus and ovaries are in there, and also grow in size. The exact timing of your body’s growth will be unique to you.

Vaginal/cervical fluid: Sometime after your breasts start to grow, you may notice a change to the fluid in your vagina, and it may feel a bit wetter than before. Some people will notice this about 6–12 months before a first period. It will likely be a thin, whitish liquid, and won’t have much of a smell. 

As you get close to your first period, you may be able to notice the fluid from your vagina changing day-to-day.

Sebum production is influenced by your hormones, particularly androgens (like testosterone).

"There are a variety of conditions that can cause HMB. The most common conditions include:

Polyps, or growths in the uterine lining, usually cause spotting or bleeding between periods and sometimes HMB.
Adenomyosis, the abnormal growth of uterine lining (endometrium) into the muscular wall of uterus, but can sometimes cause heavy and/or painful periods.
Uterine fibroids, benign growths (smooth muscle tumors) on the uterus, also known as leiomyomas, can sometimes cause HMB. If they grow in the uterine lining (endometrium) they will most likely cause HMB.
Cancers and precancers are very uncommon, but important, causes of abnormal bleeding, particularly for individuals under the age of 40. While they can cause HMB, cancers and precancers more likely cause irregular bleeding or bleeding between periods.
Coagulopathy, an inherited disorder preventing the blood from clotting normally, will cause HMB usually from menarche (the first period).
Ovulatory disorder, the absence or irregularity of ovulation, is a hormonal problem that may cause irregular bleeding that may or may not include HMB as a symptom.

Since sebum (oil produced by the sebaceous gland) and the hair follicle exit from the same opening in the skin, the hair and skin surrounding may be coated in sebum. One study had an interesting finding: even if more bad hair days were registered around the time of menstruation, they did not correlate with increases in scalp sebum levels. There was not a clear explanation for the bad hair days—perhaps it’s due to a difference in participants’ personal perception of their hair. Is the change on your head or in your head? Interesting right?

Some hormonal contraceptive medications (like chlormadinone acetate, a synthetic progesterone which provides anti-androgen activity) may also affect hair and skin quality. In one study of people taking these medications, participants had decreased sebum production and improved perceived hair quality.

Sebum production is influenced by your hormones, particularly androgens (like testosterone). Sebum production often ramps up greatly during puberty, often being produced at high amounts between the ages of 15 to 35, as assessed on the skin. Estrogen also influences sebum production, especially at high doses. ",How does my hair change during periods 
But I don't know how to identify them and I am scared.,"There are a variety of conditions that can cause HMB. The most common conditions include:

Polyps, or growths in the uterine lining, usually cause spotting or bleeding between periods and sometimes HMB.
Adenomyosis, the abnormal growth of uterine lining (endometrium) into the muscular wall of uterus, but can sometimes cause heavy and/or painful periods.
Uterine fibroids, benign growths (smooth muscle tumors) on the uterus, also known as leiomyomas, can sometimes cause HMB. If they grow in the uterine lining (endometrium) they will most likely cause HMB.
Cancers and precancers are very uncommon, but important, causes of abnormal bleeding, particularly for individuals under the age of 40. While they can cause HMB, cancers and precancers more likely cause irregular bleeding or bleeding between periods.
Coagulopathy, an inherited disorder preventing the blood from clotting normally, will cause HMB usually from menarche (the first period).
Ovulatory disorder, the absence or irregularity of ovulation, is a hormonal problem that may cause irregular bleeding that may or may not include HMB as a symptom.
Endometrial disorder, an abnormality in the lining of the uterus, prevents the tissues from stopping the bleeding normally.",What is causing my Heavy Menstrual Bleeding,"When your body releases these prostaglandins (pro-inflammatory chemical-messengers), stimulating your uterus to contract, your endometrial lining is released from your uterus.

"To treat HMB (heavy menstrual bleeding), you and your healthcare provider need to determine its cause or causes. This can be done by a few simple tests including a blood test, a transvaginal ultrasound and/or taking a sample tissue from the uterine lining (endometrial biopsy).

Polyps: Surgical removal of the polyp is the most effective therapy.
Adenomyosis: Treatment with hormonal contraception, especially an intrauterine device that releases a hormone called progestin.
Fibroids: Some medical or hormonal therapies are effective, although procedures involving surgery are often necessary.
Cancer or pre-cancer: Most pre-cancers can be treated with medication, but cancers usually require surgery.
Blood clotting disorder: Tranexamic acid or hormonal medications are the usual treatment strategy.
Ovulatory disorders: Ovulatory disorders can generally be treated with hormonal medication such as progestins or other hormonal contraceptive medications.
Endometrial disorders: People with endometrial disorders can respond well to tranexamic acid, use of simple NSAIDs like ibuprofen, naproxen or mefenamic acid, the progestin-releasing intrauterine system or other types of hormonal contraception. When a copper intrauterine device is the cause, some of the treatments for endometrial disorders can be effective.
Iron deficiency: Whenever there is an iron deficiency, and especially if there is anemia, an iron replacement should be part of the treatment.
Surgery can be important especially for removal of polyps or fibroids since it can be performed simply and in a way that preserves fertility. Finally, invasive surgery (such as endometrial ablation and hysterectomy) is the last resort to help with the HMB, but is always carefully considered as these procedures can remove your chances to bear children.","What should I do for heavy periods, it is very uncomfortable","Any of the following can help you identify heavy periods:

"Blood (and tissue) changes color depending on how long it has been exposed to air oxygenation. Think of when you cut your skin—red blood comes out of a fresh wound. If you put a bandage on it and check it the next day, you’ll see that once-red blood will have turned brown. The majority of the water in the blood will have evaporated, making a more concentrated pigmentation.

Your endometrium is the inner lining of your uterus, which is where a fertilized egg would implant and grow. The endometrium is made up of highly vascularized tissue with special spiralized arteries. This provides a fertilized egg with quick and easy access to a fresh blood supply (carrying nutrients and oxygen), so it can start to develop. Right before you get your period, these specialized spiral arteries constrict, to limit blood loss. After the constriction of the spiral arteries, the endometrium starts to break away in pieces from the deeper layers of the uterus. Your endometrium does not separate all at once, it’s a slower, controlled separation, and it takes time for your endometrial tissue to make its way down through your cervix and vagina. This initial blood and tissue may appear dark red or brown, or even black because it takes longer to exit your body.

As tissue breaks away, it leaves torn ends of blood vessels that continue to bleed. This is where the bright red blood you may see during your period comes from. Eventually, platelets (pieces of cells involved in blood clotting) are activated to group together and form a plug to stop the bleeding, bringing the period to an end.

Endometrial disorders: People with endometrial disorders can respond well to tranexamic acid, use of simple NSAIDs like ibuprofen, naproxen or mefenamic acid, the progestin-releasing intrauterine system or other types of hormonal contraception. When a copper intrauterine device is the cause, some of the treatments for endometrial disorders can be effective.
Iron deficiency: Whenever there is an iron deficiency, and especially if there is anemia, an iron replacement should be part of the treatment.

Your menstrual period lasts longer than seven days.
Your flow soaks through tampons or pads every hour for a few hours in a row.
You need to change pads or tampons during the night.
You have multiple grape-sized (or larger) blood clots.
Your heavy menstrual flow keeps you from doing things you would normally do.
You are tired, have a lack of energy or are short of breath.
You feel heavy pain in your abdomen and lower back.
",But I don't know how to identify them and I am scared.
What does it mean if my period blood is bright red?,"At the beginning or end of your period, blood can be a dark brown/red shade and can have a thick consistency—but it’s also normal for the first signs of your period to be bright red and more liquid.

If you notice brown period blood at the start or end of your period, it’s because the blood is older and took longer to leave your uterus. The uterine lining darkens the longer it takes to leave the body.

Period blood clots are normal on the heaviest days of your period and can appear deep red or almost dark black as well.","I noticed different colours of blood throughout my period, do they have any significance","Blood (and tissue) changes color depending on how long it has been exposed to air oxygenation. Think of when you cut your skin—red blood comes out of a fresh wound. If you put a bandage on it and check it the next day, you’ll see that once-red blood will have turned brown. The majority of the water in the blood will have evaporated, making a more concentrated pigmentation.

Your endometrium is the inner lining of your uterus, which is where a fertilized egg would implant and grow. The endometrium is made up of highly vascularized tissue with special spiralized arteries. This provides a fertilized egg with quick and easy access to a fresh blood supply (carrying nutrients and oxygen), so it can start to develop. Right before you get your period, these specialized spiral arteries constrict, to limit blood loss. After the constriction of the spiral arteries, the endometrium starts to break away in pieces from the deeper layers of the uterus. Your endometrium does not separate all at once, it’s a slower, controlled separation, and it takes time for your endometrial tissue to make its way down through your cervix and vagina. This initial blood and tissue may appear dark red or brown, or even black because it takes longer to exit your body.

As tissue breaks away, it leaves torn ends of blood vessels that continue to bleed. This is where the bright red blood you may see during your period comes from. Eventually, platelets (pieces of cells involved in blood clotting) are activated to group together and form a plug to stop the bleeding, bringing the period to an end.

As bleeding slows toward the end of a period, it may once again appear darker red or brown.",What does the color of your period blood mean?,"To treat HMB (heavy menstrual bleeding), you and your healthcare provider need to determine its cause or causes.

However, if it’s very, very light—like you only see a little on your toilet paper—that probably could be considered spotting.

For example, if you have light bleeding on Sunday, no bleeding on Monday, and bleed enough to require a tampon on Tuesday, you should consider Sunday the start of your period.",How does spotting differ from light period bleeding?,"Researchers and healthcare providers often describe spotting as bleeding that doesn’t require sanitary protection (e.g. you don’t need to use a pad or tampon).

However, this is kind of an arbitrary definition. Even if bleeding isn’t heavy, some people may just choose to use protection anyway.

In theory, spotting can happen at any time during your cycle, so around the period or between periods. Bleeding that doesn’t seem to be associated with the period, such as bleeding during the middle of your cycle, that requires sanitary protection is called non-menstrual bleeding. Sometimes people describe this bleeding as heavy spotting.",what is spotting?,"The lines between menstrual bleeding (i.e. your period), spotting, and non-menstrual bleeding can get kind of confusing. Menstrual bleeding is bleeding that is associated with the shedding of the endometrium at the end of the menstrual cycle. Spotting has different definitions, depending on who you ask."
"There are several reasons why you might be spotting:

1. Hormonal contraception and spotting
Spotting is a common side effect of hormonal contraception, especially during the first few months of starting a new method. 

2. Pregnancy and spotting
Spotting is also a common symptom of early pregnancy. About 1 in 4 people experience spotting, usually between gestational weeks 5 and 8 (or about 1 to 4 weeks after someone expects their period).If you are worried about having a miscarriage, then worry not —research has shown that people with spotting aren’t more likely to have a miscarriage than people who don’t have spotting. However, heavy spotting or bleeding may be more of a concern. If you’re pregnant and bleeding, call your healthcare provider to let them know what’s going on. While many sources call spotting in early pregnancy “implantation bleeding,” there isn’t strong evidence that it’s associated with an embryo’s implantation in the uterus. It may actually be related to hormonal changes, as the production of progesterone switches from the ovary to the forming placenta.

Spotting can be a symptom of an ectopic pregnancy. This is a pregnancy that is growing somewhere other than the uterus, usually the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancy bleeding may be coupled with other symptoms including abdominal pain on one side, shoulder pain, and/or dizziness. If you experience symptoms of spotting and suspect you may have an ectopic pregnancy, seek immediate medical help.

"Physical conditions, infections, and spotting Spotting can also be caused by infections and physical changes in the reproductive tract, or hormonal imbalances. Physical conditions that can cause spotting episodes include fibroids (abnormal growth of muscle tissue on your uterus), uterine or cervical polyps (abnormal growths on your cervix or the inside of your uterus) and endometriosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which happens when certain pelvic infections (like STIs) go untreated, can also be another culprit for unscheduled spotting.

If you suspect you have spotting and other associated symptoms of PID or of physical pelvic conditions, it’s important to discuss this with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can cause bleeding from the urethra (where you pee from, between your clitoris and vagina). Pain while urinating, paired with a small amount of blood on the toilet paper, might be signs of a UTI. Consistently spotting after penetrative vaginal intercourse is not considered normal. Bleeding after sex (postcoital spotting) is often caused by an issue with the cervix or polyps. Some people may experience spotting after their first intercourse experience, which is normal. If you’re noticing spotting after sex, talk to your healthcare provider. If you’re taking combined oral contraceptives (the most common type of birth control pill), you may have spotting that goes away after a couple of months. If spotting between withdrawal bleeding continues, your pill may not be the best fit for you, and you may want to try another brand with a different chemical formulation. Spotting might also happen if you forget to take your pills and the levels of the pill’s hormones drop in your body.

"As ovulation approaches, your body produces more cervical fluid. You can see this fluid in your underwear or on toilet paper when you use the bathroom. It becomes stretchier, clearer, and more wet and slippery—like a raw egg white. This fluid tends to “peak” about 1 to 2 days before ovulation, when estrogen is highest. A surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) occurs and triggers the egg to be released from the follicle 36 to 40 hours after the spike in estrogen. Some people feel ovulation pain or “mittelschmerz”—a sharp or cramp-like pain felt on either side of the lower abdomen, that can last a few hours or days.

Tracking your basal body temperature (BBT) can also allow you to detect ovulation — as progesterone rises to prepare the uterus for implantation of a fertilized , it causes a slight increase in your BBT.

If you’re taking combined oral contraceptives (the most common type of birth control pill), you may have spotting that goes away after a couple of months. If spotting between withdrawal bleeding continues, your pill may not be the best fit for you, and you may want to try another brand with a different chemical formulation. Spotting might also happen if you forget to take your pills and the levels of the pill’s hormones drop in your body. Spotting is common and often unpredictable with the hormonal IUD, the contraceptive implant, the contraceptive shot (injection, and the mini-pill (a progestin-only pill).",Is there any link between physical conditions or infections and spotting?,"There are several reasons why you might be spotting:

1. Hormonal contraception and spotting
Spotting is a common side effect of hormonal contraception, especially during the first few months of starting a new method. 

2. Pregnancy and spotting
Spotting is also a common symptom of early pregnancy. About 1 in 4 people experience spotting, usually between gestational weeks 5 and 8 (or about 1 to 4 weeks after someone expects their period).If you are worried about having a miscarriage, then worry not —research has shown that people with spotting aren’t more likely to have a miscarriage than people who don’t have spotting. However, heavy spotting or bleeding may be more of a concern. If you’re pregnant and bleeding, call your healthcare provider to let them know what’s going on. While many sources call spotting in early pregnancy “implantation bleeding,” there isn’t strong evidence that it’s associated with an embryo’s implantation in the uterus. It may actually be related to hormonal changes, as the production of progesterone switches from the ovary to the forming placenta.

Spotting can be a symptom of an ectopic pregnancy. This is a pregnancy that is growing somewhere other than the uterus, usually the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancy bleeding may be coupled with other symptoms including abdominal pain on one side, shoulder pain, and/or dizziness. If you experience symptoms of spotting and suspect you may have an ectopic pregnancy, seek immediate medical help.

3. Ovulation, hormonal issues, and spotting
Spotting can also occur around the time of ovulation. It’s unclear why some people experience ovulation bleeding while others don’t—some research suggests it happens in people who have higher levels of some hormones."
"Some of the most common symptoms of uterine fibroids are:

Periods that are heavy, long, and/or painful
Irregular bleeding 
Pelvic pressure or pain 
Frequent urination and difficulty emptying the bladder
Constipation 
Difficulty getting pregnant or carrying to term
In rare cases, uterine fibroids can become very large, twisted, or infected. These situations can create intense symptoms, and may require immediate medical treatment.

Some studies show that pregnancy may cause fibroids to grow slightly bigger in up to 1 in 3 people. This might make some symptoms more noticeable. The most common complication of uterine fibroids in pregnancy is pain, usually felt in the second and third trimesters",What are its symptoms,"Uterine fibroids are abnormal growths of muscle tissue that form in (or on) the walls of the uterus. Fibroids are benign (not harmful/life threatening), but can cause symptoms such as irregular vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. Uterine fibroids are sometimes called myomas or leiomyomas in medical literature.

Uterine fibroids are very common. About 3 in 4 women may have them at some point in their lives. They are most common during the reproductive years, and are more likely to occur in people of African ancestry. Uterine fibroids most often cause no symptoms at all and often shrink after menopause. In other cases, untreated fibroids may lead to problems such as heavy bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain or pressure, fertility changes, and complications during pregnancy. Symptoms depend on the size, location, and number of fibroids.",I do't have any idea about what uterine fibroid is,"As ovulation approaches, your body produces more cervical fluid. You can see this fluid in your underwear or on toilet paper when you use the bathroom. It becomes stretchier, clearer, and more wet and slippery—like a raw egg white. This fluid tends to “peak” about 1 to 2 days before ovulation, when estrogen is highest. A surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) occurs and triggers the egg to be released from the follicle 36 to 40 hours after the spike in estrogen. Some people feel ovulation pain or “mittelschmerz”—a sharp or cramp-like pain felt on either side of the lower abdomen, that can last a few hours or days.

Tracking your basal body temperature (BBT) can also allow you to detect ovulation — as progesterone rises to prepare the uterus for implantation of a fertilized , it causes a slight increase in your BBT. You can also use ovulation prediction tests/kits (OPKs).",how do you know when ovulation is happening?,"Physical conditions, infections, and spotting Spotting can also be caused by infections and physical changes in the reproductive tract, or hormonal imbalances. Physical conditions that can cause spotting episodes include fibroids (abnormal growth of muscle tissue on your uterus), uterine or cervical polyps (abnormal growths on your cervix or the inside of your uterus) and endometriosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which happens when certain pelvic infections (like STIs) go untreated, can also be another culprit for unscheduled spotting. Other symptoms of PID can include pain in the lower abdomen, unusual vaginal discharge, and fever. If you suspect you have spotting and other associated symptoms of PID or of physical pelvic conditions, it’s important to discuss this with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can cause bleeding from the urethra (where you pee from, between your clitoris and vagina). Pain while urinating, paired with a small amount of blood on the toilet paper, might be signs of a UTI. Consistently spotting after penetrative vaginal intercourse is not considered normal.

"Uterine fibroids occur when muscle cells in the uterus multiply too many times. As cells multiply, lumps of various shapes and sizes are formed.

"You and your healthcare provider may choose to leave fibroids with mild symptoms untreated. Tracking your symptoms can then help you know if your fibroids are changing, and at what point a treatment plan might be helpful. When fibroids do become problematic, there are many different options for managing and treating them, and for preventing their future formation:

Medications
In some cases, hormonal medications are prescribed to treat uterine fibroids. These include Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulators (SPRM) which change the effect of progesterone in the body, and Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Agonists which block the body’s production of both progesterone and estrogen. These medications have been shown to lessen the size and number of uterine fibroids over time in people of reproductive age.

Lifestyle Changes
Maintaining a healthy weight may help lessen the occurrence uterine fibroids. Getting enough exercise and eating a balanced diet may also help with this. Specifically, a diet low in red meat and high in green vegetables may help to lessen the prevalence and severity of fibroids in some people.

Non-surgical procedures
Some symptomatic uterine fibroids may be destroyed through non-invasive procedures like uterine artery embolization and radiofrequency myolysis. These procedures cut off blood supply to fibroids. MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) is an example of a newer technique that uses soundwaves to destroy fibroids.

Surgery
Uterine fibroids are sometimes treated with minimally invasive surgical procedures, via the abdomen or pelvis. Some cases of fibroids may be treated with a procedure called an abdominal myomectomy, in which problematic fibroids are surgically removed. In severe cases, a hysterectomy, or a removal of the uterus, may be performed",What can I do about uterine fibroids,"A healthcare provider will probably ask questions about your symptoms, medical, and menstrual history.

Some uterine fibroids may also interfere with the probability of becoming pregnant, and may increase the chance of miscarriage, but more research is needed here. In these cases, treatment can help people become and stay pregnant.

Rarely, uterine fibroids can become very large, twisted, or infected. These situations can create symptoms that are intense, and may require immediate medical treatment, hence it is important to get them checked.",Why do you need to get checked for uterine fibroids,"Uterine fibroids occur when muscle cells in the uterus multiply too many times. As cells multiply, lumps of various shapes and sizes are formed. They can be numerous or few—some people might only have one. These lumps can grow on the inner and outer surfaces of the uterus, as well as within the uterine wall.

Research shows the hormones estrogen and progesterone play a role in the growth of uterine fibroids. This is probably why fibroids tend to shrink after menopause, when production of these hormones decreases.

Some people are more likely than others to develop uterine fibroids, and in fact fibroids may be inherited genetically. This means someone is more likely to develop fibroids if a family member has had them. People of African ancestry are significantly more likely to develop them. If you have hypertension or polycystic ovary syndrome, then you are more likely to have uterine fibroids. They are more common in people who have an earlier age at first menstruation (menarche), and people who have not given birth, though this may be because women with fibroids may have difficulty conceiving. Maintaining a diet high in red meat consumption may also increase the risk of uterine fibroids, as may beer consumption.

There are different types of fibroids which can create different symptoms. Fibroids embedded within the uterine wall (intramural fibroids) can change the shape of the uterus, which may cause changes in fertility. Fibroids that project into the inside of the uterus (submucosal fibroids) may also cause difficulty in becoming or staying pregnant",Why uterine fibroids happen
I  might have underactive thyroid. Can that cause heacy periods?,"You and your healthcare provider may choose to leave fibroids with mild symptoms untreated. Tracking your symptoms can then help you know if your fibroids are changing, and at what point a treatment plan might be helpful. When fibroids do become problematic, there are many different options for managing and treating them, and for preventing their future formation:

Medications
In some cases, hormonal medications are prescribed to treat uterine fibroids. These include Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulators (SPRM) which change the effect of progesterone in the body, and Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Agonists which block the body’s production of both progesterone and estrogen. These medications have been shown to lessen the size and number of uterine fibroids over time in people of reproductive age.

Lifestyle Changes
Maintaining a healthy weight may help lessen the occurrence uterine fibroids. Getting enough exercise and eating a balanced diet may also help with this. Specifically, a diet low in red meat and high in green vegetables may help to lessen the prevalence and severity of fibroids in some people.

Non-surgical procedures
Some symptomatic uterine fibroids may be destroyed through non-invasive procedures like uterine artery embolization and radiofrequency myolysis. These procedures cut off blood supply to fibroids. MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) is an example of a newer technique that uses soundwaves to destroy fibroids.

Surgery
Uterine fibroids are sometimes treated with minimally invasive surgical procedures, via the abdomen or pelvis.

In severe cases, a hysterectomy, or a removal of the uterus, may be performed",What can I do about uterine fibroids,"A healthcare provider will probably ask questions about your symptoms, medical, and menstrual history.

"In short, yes! Dysmenorrhea (i.e. painful menstruation) has been linked to working in jobs that are low control, are unsecure and have low coworker support. Stress from the preceding month may also affect the frequency of dysmenorrhea, so someone might not experience painful menstruation as a result of stress until their period the following month. Similarly, people experiencing stress earlier in their cycle were more likely to report severe symptoms during the time leading up to and during menstruation.

As mentioned, the different effects of stress may be, in part, due to timing. Higher reported stress during the follicular phase (i.e. from the first day of menstruation until ovulation) has been strongly associated with changes in normal reproductive function. In one recent study, those reporting pre-ovulatory stress (during the follicular phase) were less likely to become pregnant as compared to those not reporting stress during the same time. This suggests that stress may cause the body to delay or entirely suppress ovulation. This idea is supported by research examining menstrual cycle variation.

The length of the luteal phase (i.e. post-ovulation until menstruation) tends to be consistent across and within women, whereas the length of the follicular phase has a stronger association with the variation in the total length of the entire menstrual cycle. This means that the follicular phase, as opposed to the luteal phase, is more likely to change in length. Therefore, the effects of stress on ovulation may be one of the biggest factors related to changes in cycle length due to stress, though it is unclear how this would be related to other stress-related changes in the menstrual cycle, such as painful menstruation.",I have a very stressful life.

"1. Know that it’s OK—this has happened to most people who menstruate.
If you do get an unexpected period at school and are not prepared, there is no need to panic. You are not the first and definitely not the last in this situation.

What’s important now is to make you feel comfortable with the situation. A big part of that is making sure your blood is collected in a way that makes you feel comfortable—that means getting some supplies.

2. Get supplies that you feel comfortable using.
Schools usually stock their menstrual products in two places: the girls’ bathrooms (either in free-for-all baskets or in small change vending machines) and the nurse’s office. (Some schools may not have a nurse’s office or health office.)

If you are in class, ask to be excused to the bathroom or the nurse’s office. Ask a friend who menstruates if they have an extra pad or tampon you could borrow. If they don’t, grab some small change just in case you need to use a vending machine to purchase supplies. If your teacher asks what’s happening and you don’t feel comfortable discussing your period in front of others (no need to feel bad about your body doing its thing, but it’s a subject that may take getting used to!), “stomach problems” are a good go-to.

Some schools allow students who have their period or are experiencing bad cramps to skip PE / PT classes or to work out at their own pace instead of joining the rest of the group. Find out if that is the case for your school and whom you should inform if you would need to be excused from working out on a given day.

Know that it’s OK—this has happened to most people who menstruate.
If you do get an unexpected period at school and are not prepared, there is no need to panic. You are not the first and definitely not the last in this situation.

What’s important now is to make you feel comfortable with the situation. A big part of that is making sure your blood is collected in a way that makes you feel comfortable—that means getting some supplies.

2. Get supplies that you feel comfortable using.
Schools usually stock their menstrual products in two places: the girls’ bathrooms (either in free-for-all baskets or in small change vending machines) and the nurse’s office. (Some schools may not have a nurse’s office or health office.)

If you are in class, ask to be excused to the bathroom or the nurse’s office. Ask a friend who menstruates if they have an extra pad or tampon you could borrow. If they don’t, grab some small change just in case you need to use a vending machine to purchase supplies. If your teacher asks what’s happening and you don’t feel comfortable discussing your period in front of others (no need to feel bad about your body doing its thing, but it’s a subject that may take getting used to!), “stomach problems” are a good go-to.

Some schools allow students who have their period or are experiencing bad cramps to skip PE / PT classes or to work out at their own pace instead of joining the rest of the group. Find out if that is the case for your school and whom you should inform if you would need to be excused from working out on a given day.
",What to do if I get my periods at school,"In short, yes! Dysmenorrhea (i.e. painful menstruation) has been linked to working in jobs that are low control, are unsecure and have low coworker support. Stress from the preceding month may also affect the frequency of dysmenorrhea, so someone might not experience painful menstruation as a result of stress until their period the following month. Similarly, people experiencing stress earlier in their cycle were more likely to report severe symptoms during the time leading up to and during menstruation.

As mentioned, the different effects of stress may be, in part, due to timing. Higher reported stress during the follicular phase (i.e. from the first day of menstruation until ovulation) has been strongly associated with changes in normal reproductive function. In one recent study, those reporting pre-ovulatory stress (during the follicular phase) were less likely to become pregnant as compared to those not reporting stress during the same time. This suggests that stress may cause the body to delay or entirely suppress ovulation. This idea is supported by research examining menstrual cycle variation.

The length of the luteal phase (i.e. post-ovulation until menstruation) tends to be consistent across and within women, whereas the length of the follicular phase has a stronger association with the variation in the total length of the entire menstrual cycle. This means that the follicular phase, as opposed to the luteal phase, is more likely to change in length. Therefore, the effects of stress on ovulation may be one of the biggest factors related to changes in cycle length due to stress, though it is unclear how this would be related to other stress-related changes in the menstrual cycle, such as painful menstruation.",I have a very stressful life.

"Yes, it does. The vagina can change a lot throughout a person's life. An average adult vagina is slightly curved, and can range between 7 to 12 cm in length — but every body is different, and there’s no such thing as a too small or too large vagina.

The vagina is strongly influenced by hormonal changes throughout the body. During the reproductive years after menarche (the first menstrual period) and before menopause, more layers of tissue are present lining the vagina, due to stimulation from higher estrogen levels in the body.

After menopause, when estrogen is lower, the walls of the vagina become thinner and frailer, which can cause symptoms of vaginal dryness and decreased vaginal secretions.

This tube is the connection between your uterus and the outside world. The vagina is what babies exit through during birth, and what menstrual blood exits through during your period. The vagina is also used for insertion, such as with a penis, fingers, female condoms, sex toys, tampons, or menstrual cups.

The vagina can also act as a route to other parts of the body. During penis-vagina sex, ejaculate is deposited in the vagina, allowing sperm to enter the uterus through the cervix. The walls of the vagina can also be used as an administrative route for medications and contraceptives, such as intervaginal hormone creams, the hormonal vaginal contraceptive ring, or vaginal suppository medications.",What is a vagina?,"That is a nice question, a lot of people don't know that vulva and vagin are two different parts. The vulva is the part of your genitals on the outside of your body — your labia, clitoris, vaginal opening, and the opening to the urethra (the hole you pee out of). While vaginas are just one part of the vulva, many people say “vagina” when they really mean the vulva. But the vulva has a lot more going on than just the vagina.",Is my vagina and vulva the same thing?,If you are confirmed as a female by birth then you do have a vagina.
"Yes it will! The vagina is also influenced by changing hormone levels during pregnancy. Increased blood flow is directed to the pelvis, causing a deeper color change to the vulva and vagina. Throughout a pregnancy, the connective tissue of the vaginal walls progressively relaxes, in preparation for the delivery of a baby. After delivery, the vagina and vaginal opening temporarily widen, but 6-12 weeks post-delivery, the vagina returns to its pre-pregnancy size. As people age, the walls of the vagina become more relaxed, and the diameter of the vagina becomes wider. When it comes to sexual satisfaction, vaginal size does not affect sexual function. The perception of vaginal tightness during sex is primarily related to the pelvic floor muscles, which are present around the base of the vagina and not actually how wide the vaginal canal is.",Will it change during pregnancy too?,"Yes, it does. The vagina can change a lot throughout a person's life. An average adult vagina is slightly curved, and can range between 7 to 12 cm in length — but every body is different, and there’s no such thing as a too small or too large vagina.

The vagina is strongly influenced by hormonal changes throughout the body. During the reproductive years after menarche (the first menstrual period) and before menopause, more layers of tissue are present lining the vagina, due to stimulation from higher estrogen levels in the body.

"The vagina can undergo more rapid changes, such as during sexual activity. When a person with a vagina is sexually aroused, increased blood flow is directed towards the genitals, causing the vaginal tissue to become engorged with blood, and additional lubrication to be produced. This fluid is called arousal fluid.

During sexual excitement, the vagina expands by lengthening and widening in shape. This is called vaginal tenting and ballooning. This shape change happens as the uterus and cervix are drawn higher into the pelvis, which creates more space and moves the cervix farther away from any semen that is ejaculated into the vagina. This allows time for the semen to mix with female genital fluids, stimulating the sperm to undergo the physical changes necessary for fertilizing an egg (9).

They stop the usual hormonal “cycling”, including ovulation, the typical growth of the endometrium, and the natural period, meaning you ideally should not be ovulating and can't get pregnant if taken correctly.",Do I ovulate on the contraceptive pill?,"If you want to wash your vagina, you should wash do it with warm water. If you’d like, you can use a mild soap that won’t irritate the skin — but this isn’t necessary. Spread your lips apart and gently cleanse around the folds, using a clean washcloth or your hands. Avoid getting water or soap inside your vagina.

In addition to washing your vulva, it’s a good idea to wash the anus and the area between your vulva and anus every day. It’s best to wash “front to back” — in other words, wash your vulva first and then your anus. Otherwise, bacteria from the anus can spread to your vagina, which can cause infections.",How to clean my vagina?,"The vagina can undergo more rapid changes, such as during sexual activity. When a person with a vagina is sexually aroused, increased blood flow is directed towards the genitals, causing the vaginal tissue to become engorged with blood, and additional lubrication to be produced. This fluid is called arousal fluid.

During sexual excitement, the vagina expands by lengthening and widening in shape. This is called vaginal tenting and ballooning. This shape change happens as the uterus and cervix are drawn higher into the pelvis, which creates more space and moves the cervix farther away from any semen that is ejaculated into the vagina. This allows time for the semen to mix with female genital fluids, stimulating the sperm to undergo the physical changes necessary for fertilizing an egg (9).

The vagina is an incredible organ which changes in response to hormones, life stages, and physical responses. So show your vagina some love, and feel free to tell anyone you want just how amazing your vagina really is."

"The exact start of perimenopause—the transition into menopause—is hard to pinpoint. One study that tracked women as they transitioned into menopause found that menstrual irregularity began on average between ages 47 and 48. But it can begin much earlier or later. In that same study, of those who were still menstruating at age 45, about 1 in 3 reported menstrual irregularity. At age 52, about 1 in 10 reported that they were still menstruating normally. There are other perimenopausal changes and symptoms that may be felt before menstrual irregularity begins, which may help in identifying a different starting point of perimenopause, but more research is needed.

Menopause—when periods actually stop— happens on average at age 51, but most people reach it anywhere between ages 45–55. About 4 in 10 women reach menopause by age 50, 9 in 10 will reach it by age 55.  

Menopause is considered “early” when before age 45, and  “premature” when it happens before age 40. Premature menopause is also sometimes called primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or premature ovarian failure (not the greatest of terms). About 1 in 100 people experience premature menopause for non-surgical or chemotherapy-related reasons. Early menopause can be caused or influenced by cigarette smoking, certain medications,  chemotherapy, and possibly insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (10,11). 

People who have an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) will undergo menopause immediately. Sometimes people who have had a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) will also experience early menopause, even if their ovaries are not removed. People who have had menopause induced due to surgery, drug treatments, or medication generally do not experience perimenopause, since there is an abrupt stop to their reproductive function. But people with induced menopause may still experience symptoms of menopause.",When will my perimenopause start?

One study that tracked women as they transitioned into menopause found that menstrual irregularity began on average between ages 47 and 48. But it can begin much earlier or later.

"1. At first, you may notice that your period arrives slightly earlier each cycle (ie shorter menstrual cycles) and is heavier.

As you approach perimenopause, your hormone levels begin to change. This happens before your periods become unpredictable. For some people, one of the earliest signs of perimenopause is that their periods arrive slightly earlier—meaning that their menstrual cycle shortens, by ~2–4 days This is due to a shortening of the follicular phase (the first part of the menstrual cycle), as ovulation happens more quickly. During perimenopause, less estrogen is produced. But before perimenopause, estrogen levels can actually rise for a while, and progesterone levels typically decrease . This is what shortens the follicular phase, and may also cause other changes, symptoms, or sensations. You may notice changes to the heaviness of your period during this time. Lower progesterone—with or without higher estrogen—may also lead to heavier periods, which is more common in early perimenopause.

2. Later, you may have irregular cycles and bleeding changes. 

As the number of follicles in your ovaries decreases, ovulation becomes less common, and hormone levels start to fluctuate more and more. Menstrual cycles might become longer, and then progressively more variable—longer and shorter, with menstrual periods that are heavier, lighter, and far less predictable . 

The heaviness of your period will also fluctuate. Cycles without ovulation may have lighter periods, while periods that come after a long cycle may be long. On average, about 6 of the final 10 cycles before menopause are prolonged and anovulatory (where ovulation doesn’t occur). In the 1-2 years before menopause, it’s common for cycles to last more than 5 weeks. 

3. Eventually, no period it is.

As ovulation becomes rare, your period might go away for months at a time, and then return. This phase lasts between 1-3 years for most people, but again, everyone is different (6). Eventually, menopause is reached, and cycles comes to an end, along with the period.

About 1 in 10 people may stop menstruating more abruptly, with much less prolonged irregularity.",How will my menstrual cycle changes before and during perimenopause,"Here are some symptoms you might experience:

Lower progesterone—with or without higher estrogen—may also lead to heavier periods, which is more common in early perimenopause.

2. Later, you may have irregular cycles and bleeding changes. 

As the number of follicles in your ovaries decreases, ovulation becomes less common, and hormone levels start to fluctuate more and more. Menstrual cycles might become longer, and then progressively more variable—longer and shorter, with menstrual periods that are heavier, lighter, and far less predictable . 

The heaviness of your period will also fluctuate. Cycles without ovulation may have lighter periods, while periods that come after a long cycle may be long. On average, about 6 of the final 10 cycles before menopause are prolonged and anovulatory (where ovulation doesn’t occur). In the 1-2 years before menopause, it’s common for cycles to last more than 5 weeks. 

3. Eventually, no period it is.

As ovulation becomes rare, your period might go away for months at a time, and then return. This phase lasts between 1-3 years for most people, but again, everyone is different (6). Eventually, menopause is reached, and cycles comes to an end, along with the period.

Your genetics, environment, and lifestyle may all play a role in how you experience perimenopause, and the timing of perimenopause and menopause. People who reach menopause later in life tend to have shorter transitions. Smokers tend to be slightly younger at perimenopause and have shorter transitions, reaching menopause about a year earlier than average.

A person’s pregnancy history and their history of oral contraceptives (OCs) use might delay menopause. Studies on the topic are mixed—some studies have found an association, and others not—and the biological reason why this would be the case (if true) is not fully understood (5,10,13).

Perimenopause is the transition period, and menopause is the time after your last period. 

The menstrual cycle irregularities of perimenopause last an average of about 4 years, from the beginning of menstrual irregularity to the last period.

"Uterine polyps occur when cells of the uterine lining (the endometrium) multiply too many times. As this happens, lumps are formed. These lumps often resemble hanging sacs or mushrooms made of tissue. Most are very small, but can range in size from a few millimeters, to several centimeters in diameter. Polyps can be numerous or few, and some people might only have one. Some research shows that estrogen plays an important role in the formation of polyps, but it’s not yet clear how.

To give you some more information, some people are more likely than others to develop uterine polyps. They are most common in people who are perimenopausal and postmenopausal. If you are obese, you must also know that obesity also makes people significantly more likely to develop polyps. If you have taken the the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, this can be a contributing factor too.

"A period is when a woman’s body releases tissue it no longer needs. This tissue comes from the uterus, which is where a baby (fetus) can develop in the female body. Every month or so, the uterus lining gets thicker to prepare for a fertilized egg if the woman becomes pregnant. If the egg doesn’t get fertilized, that lining is released from the body as blood through the vagina. This monthly process is called menstruation or a period. So when a girl has her period, her body is just getting rid of a small amount of blood and some unneeded tissue. It is a natural, normal body process for all females as they become women and mature physically.",Why am I having it?,Yes!

So when a girl has her period, her body is just getting rid of a small amount of blood and some unneeded tissue.

"Sure, why not. That is what I am here for! Every person with female physiology in their reproductive years is affected by the infradian rhythm. The infradian rhythm is one of the two internal timekeepers experienced by women. The other timekeeper is the 24-hour circadian rhythm. People with male physiology only experience the circadian rhythm. People with female physiology experience both. The infradian rhythm (and its four phases) track with your menstrual cycle, and alongside affecting the reproductive hormones, it also has an influence your brain and body, mainly brain, metabolism, immune system, microbiome, stress response system
and your reproductive system. The infradian rhythm affects our physiology cyclically which is why it supports your bodu in a cyclical way too. As a woman yourself, in order to have optimal hormonal and overall health, it is ideal that you eat, move, supplement and live in line with this infradian rhythm, which is expressed in your mesntrual cycle in four distinct phases, namely 

The follicular phase

"The week before your periods, if you have too much estrogen relative to progesterone—a condition called estrogen dominance—you can experience PMS (premenstrual syndrome) symptoms, including insomnia. Estrogen dominance is triggered by a long list of common factors, including stress, lack of self-care, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, and exposure to environmental toxins. 
Some common environmental factors make the situation even worse. Drinking caffeine is one, using alcohol to unwind is another. If you have adrenal fatigue, you may experience PMS-related insomnia as feeling “tired-but-wired,” where you lay in bed exhausted but can’t fall asleep. Micronutrient deficiencies, including low levels of magnesium, zinc, and/or selenium can also fuel the problem. Magnesium helps promote relaxation; selenium may help boost progesterone and bring your reproductive hormones back into balance; studies show that zinc can help improve sleep quantity and quality.

"Your cycle should last 26-32 days – anywhere in between is fine as long as it is regular and consistent for you.

You should be able to feel your uterus in action with some slight sensations or warm feelings, but there should not be any kind of pain that might have you reaching for drugs or hot water bottles.
After your period, leading up to ovulation, you should see the development of cervical fluid, which is an indicator of healthy fertility and necessary for getting pregnant. You might see this in your underwear or when you wipe after using the bathroom.

"Take self-care seriously. The more stressed you are (and who isn’t?), the harder you need to work to manage and mitigate stress. If you’ve been meaning to get back to getting active, do it today. Make sure you schedule dedicated non-work time—write it into your planner if you have to!—and engage in leisure activities you love. Some stresses in life aren’t modifiable (sick children or caring for elderly parents), but some are—perhaps certain friendships are no longer serving you and you can let them go or maybe the time is right to make a job switch? Scan your life for stressors you can change, and then do so!
Get off the blood sugar roller coaster. The single best (and side effect-free!) way to address blood sugar problems is with food. Emphasize healthy complex (and non-gluten) carbs, eat enough healthy, high-quality fats and proteins, and make sure you front-load non-starchy vegetables in all colors of the rainbow. One great tip for keeping blood sugar steady all day is to eat a low-glycemic breakfast within 90 minutes of waking up. And remember: sugar hides out in a lot of processed foods—even ones you wouldn’t expect. So read labels carefully, and stick to whole foods when you can.
Go to bed earlier! Hormones are hugely affected by sleep—or, more specifically, by lack thereof. The 24-hour circadian cycle has a direct influence on, and is directly influenced by, our bodies master hormones. When we’re short on sleep, it’s almost impossible to get our hormones balanced. So make sleep a priority tonight (and every night!).","I am tired of not getting my periods, I want it back","There are less talked about (but no less real) causes of missing or irregular periods, including stress.

Rather than PMS, you should notice an increase in upbeat, social energy towards the middle of your cycle, and then, in the second half of your cycle, a more focused, determined energy to get things accomplished.","This actually made me think, what classifies as a normal, healthy or perfect period?"
What causes Pre Menstrual Syndrome?,"Take self-care seriously. The more stressed you are (and who isn’t?), the harder you need to work to manage and mitigate stress. If you’ve been meaning to get back to getting active, do it today. Make sure you schedule dedicated non-work time—write it into your planner if you have to!—and engage in leisure activities you love. Some stresses in life aren’t modifiable (sick children or caring for elderly parents), but some are—perhaps certain friendships are no longer serving you and you can let them go or maybe the time is right to make a job switch? Scan your life for stressors you can change, and then do so!
Get off the blood sugar roller coaster. The single best (and side effect-free!) way to address blood sugar problems is with food. Emphasize healthy complex (and non-gluten) carbs, eat enough healthy, high-quality fats and proteins, and make sure you front-load non-starchy vegetables in all colors of the rainbow. One great tip for keeping blood sugar steady all day is to eat a low-glycemic breakfast within 90 minutes of waking up. And remember: sugar hides out in a lot of processed foods—even ones you wouldn’t expect. So read labels carefully, and stick to whole foods when you can.
Go to bed earlier! Hormones are hugely affected by sleep—or, more specifically, by lack thereof. The 24-hour circadian cycle has a direct influence on, and is directly influenced by, our bodies master hormones. When we’re short on sleep, it’s almost impossible to get our hormones balanced. So make sleep a priority tonight (and every night!).","I am tired of not getting my periods, I want it back","There are less talked about (but no less real) causes of missing or irregular periods, including stress. Chronic stress raises cortisol and messes up blood sugar, which disrupts ovulation. Studies also show that women with stressful jobs are at double the risk for anovulation (not ovulating) and menstrual cycle variability. Other research shows that women with high levels of stress around the time of ovulation have a harder time getting pregnant.

The blood sugar roller coaster, when your blood sugar is constantly going up and down thanks to eating high-sugar and refined carbohydrate foods, can also fuel missing or irregular periods. Imbalanced blood sugar is linked to infertility, and diabetes drugs like Metformin are often prescribed to women with PCOS to trigger ovulation.","I missed my periods and I don't have any of the famous causes, please help I am very scared that something is wrong with me","There are some well-known, “textbook” reasons that periods disappear, like pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause.

There’s also engaging in too much exercise. As you may know, too much of anything is never healthy. Extreme exercise can lead to hormonal imbalance, so can eating too little and/or being underweight. Finally, a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which cysts grow on your ovaries, can stop ovulation in young women.

One of the top triggers for missing periods is coming off hormonal birth control. And stopping the pill doesn’t guarantee that your period will come right back. In fact, without making a concentrated effort through food and lifestyle modifications, many women who quit the pill do not start bleeding again for months or years.","My periods have stopped coming, but I am not married. Is something wrong with me?","Your cycle should last 26-32 days – anywhere in between is fine as long as it is regular and consistent for you.
Your bleed should be the color of cranberry juice from start to finish, with no clots. A nice, strong, flow that isn’t inconveniently heavy and has you running to the bathroom every hour. Your period should really start first thing in the morning, without any brown stains leading up to the appearance of that cranberry red. And it should last 4-7 days, not longer or shorter.

"Experts believe PMS is triggered (in part) by cyclical changes in sex hormones each month. And while it is true that our sex hormones naturally shift in a cyclical pattern each month, problems crop up only when our hormones are out of balance — when, for example, we have too much estrogen in our bodies relative to progesterone (a condition known as estrogen dominance), or when we have too little progesterone overall. 

In other words, monthly hormone shifts are normal and expected. They happen! But they are not the root cause of the problem. The root cause of the problem is when we have more or less estrogen and progesterone than we need. As our bodies move through the 28-day hormone cycle in this hormonally imbalanced environment, that is when we experience symptoms.

If you address the underlying hormone imbalance with food and lifestyle, you can erase the symptoms of Pre Menstrual Syndrome. You will still be cycling through the four phases of your menstrual cycle — as you should be! — but without all the symptoms you experienced before.

"Here are some more lifestyle factors that you should be aware of:

Carrying HIDDEN weight
When I say this, I’m not talking about overweight and obesity per se. While being overweight is associated with a greater risk of PMS, the real problem is how ‘fat’ you are on the inside, which is not reflected in how much you weigh. You can be skinny on the outside and overweight on the inside — this is known in medical literature as being a “medically obese, normal-weight individual,” though a lot of practitioners refer this condition as being “skinny fat” — so you can’t just look in the mirror or step on the scale to know what’s happening on the inside. Your PMS might be telling you to address internal obesity. 

You’re not living in sync with your cycle.
You’ve probably read about the importance of the 24-hour circadian cycle—how important it is to get high-quality, consecutive hours of sleep during the night, for example, and to get some safe sun exposure during the day, etc. But you probably haven’t heard about the importance of living in sync with your 28-day cycle—and, for women, that cycle is just as important to tend to as the circadian cycle. Research shows that our 28-day menstrual cycle affects our brain function, emotions, mood, sensory processing, appetite, and even our perception of pain.

"You can take a multi-pronged approach to ease the symptoms of PMS. Here are some of my top food, supplement, and lifestyle strategies. 

Let’s start with lifestyle. Here’s how to arrange your environment to help defeat PMS:

1. Stomp out inflammation.
Eat low inflammatory foods, like cruciferous vegetables, pastured eggs and pastured animal proteins, and nuts and seeds. Reduce the amount of sugar you eat or eliminate it altogether. A high-sugar diet drives up the production of advanced-glycation end products, which contribute to inflammation. Two foods that have been shown to help specifically with prostaglandin reduction are pomegranate and small, oily fish that contain high levels of inflammation-fighting omega-3 fatty acids.

2. Make “organic” and “clean” the main part of your life.
When you’re doing your grocery and you see that clean makeup products and organic foods are more expensive than the conventional option, it can be easy to make the wallet-friendly choice. But what you need to keep in mind in these moments is the true cost of the choice you’re making. The toxins in these foods and products come into direct contact with the body and alter endocrine function, making period problems like PMS worse. You may save at check-out, but you are ultimately paying with your health. Eat organic and clean whenever possible. 

3. Give up coffee.
This piece of advice is self-explanatory and, after the first week of withdrawal, not nearly as hard as you think. Within a month you won’t even miss it. Skip caffeinated tea, too. In case you’re tempted to skip tip #3, allow me to repeat myself: no more caffeine! 

4. Improve your health from the inside out. 
You might look lean in the mirror, but if you don’t exercise (hence, you don’t have much lean muscle mass), and if you eat a high-sugar diet and/or you don’t have enough phytonutrient-rich vegetables on your plate, you might have the bloodwork profile of someone with overweight or obesity—and being overweight or obese is strongly correlated with PMS. When you start correcting what’s going on internally, you can see a reduction in symptoms.

5. Find what relaxes you… and make it a regular part of your life.
In the medical literature, high levels of stress are associated with more severe PMS. The time for stress reduction is now, not when you finish this big project or after that big presentation. Because guess what? When you finish those things there will just be more to do. The time is now. Your health depends on it.

6. Start Cycle Syncing
All of the biohacks I just mentioned will only get you so far if you don’t start to live in accordance with your cycle. Eating and exercising for each week-long phase of your 28-day cycle is the foundation of feeling better and having a symptom-free period. For too long, we’ve been living the same way day in and day out. This works for men, but not for women. Syncing your cycle will not only fix your period problems, it will help you find more happiness, energy, and success in life. Simply put, tending to your 28-day cycle is as important as tending to your 24-hour circadian cycle.","I don't want to go through PMS, please tell me to get rid of them once and for all","Yes sure, this is what I am here to do, that is to answer your questions.

You might look lean in the mirror, but if you don’t exercise (hence, you don’t have much lean muscle mass), and if you eat a high-sugar diet and/or you don’t have enough phytonutrient-rich vegetables on your plate, you might have the bloodwork profile of someone with overweight or obesity—and being overweight or obese is strongly correlated with PMS. When you start correcting what’s going on internally, you can see a reduction in symptoms.

5. Find what relaxes you… and make it a regular part of your life.
In the medical literature, high levels of stress are associated with more severe PMS. The time for stress reduction is now, not when you finish this big project or after that big presentation. Because guess what? When you finish those things there will just be more to do. The time is now. Your health depends on it.

6. Start Cycle Syncing
All of the biohacks I just mentioned will only get you so far if you don’t start to live in accordance with your cycle. Eating and exercising for each week-long phase of your 28-day cycle is the foundation of feeling better and having a symptom-free period. For too long, we’ve been living the same way day in and day out. This works for men, but not for women. Syncing your cycle will not only fix your period problems, it will help you find more happiness, energy, and success in life. Simply put, tending to your 28-day cycle is as important as tending to your 24-hour circadian cycle.","I don't want to go through PMS, please tell me to get rid of them once and for all","Yes sure, this is what I am here to do, that is to answer your questions. This is a safe space and you may ask any questions regarding your menstrual health","I still have a lot of questions, are you sure you want to continue?","Here are some more lifestyle factors that you should be aware of:

Carrying HIDDEN weight
When I say this, I’m not talking about overweight and obesity per se. While being overweight is associated with a greater risk of PMS, the real problem is how ‘fat’ you are on the inside, which is not reflected in how much you weigh. You can be skinny on the outside and overweight on the inside — this is known in medical literature as being a “medically obese, normal-weight individual,” though a lot of practitioners refer this condition as being “skinny fat” — so you can’t just look in the mirror or step on the scale to know what’s happening on the inside. Your PMS might be telling you to address internal obesity. 

You’re not living in sync with your cycle.
You’ve probably read about the importance of the 24-hour circadian cycle—how important it is to get high-quality, consecutive hours of sleep during the night, for example, and to get some safe sun exposure during the day, etc. But you probably haven’t heard about the importance of living in sync with your 28-day cycle—and, for women, that cycle is just as important to tend to as the circadian cycle. Research shows that our 28-day menstrual cycle affects our brain function, emotions, mood, sensory processing, appetite, and even our perception of pain. If you’re not supporting your body’s unique hormonal needs during each of the four phases of the 28-day cycle, you won’t have healthy, pain-free periods."
"Magnesium
Research suggests that magnesium helps alleviate symptoms of PMS, including weight gain, breast tenderness, and bloating. Magnesium is also great for promoting relaxation, reducing anxiety and stress, and encouraging good sleep. A high-quality magnesium supplement makes a great addition to your PMS-fighting arsenal. 

Vitamin B6
Supplementing with up to 100mg/day of vitamin B6 is likely to help you treat premenstrual symptoms, and premenstrual depression, according to research. 

Omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin D3
Both of these nutrients help promote hormone balance. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with reproductive hormone imbalances in both men and women. Omega-3s help protect you against anxiety and depression and may help reduce cramps.

Vitamin E
Vitamin helps reduce breast premenstrual breast tenderness, according to research. (So does vitamin B6!). 

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)
ALA offers powerful antioxidant support for the liver as it works to metabolize excess estrogen — remember: too much estrogen relative to progesterone can trigger PMS symptoms — and also supports stable blood sugar. 

Calcium
Calcium supplements have been shown to help with mood swings during the luteal phase.",And what if I want to prevent PMS but I don't want to use medicines. Are there any natural supplements?,"Chickpeas
Chickpeas are a great source of magnesium. They also contain vitamin B6. Both of these compounds, especially when taken together, help reduce symptoms of PMS.

Kale, broccoli, cauliflower, and other dark leafy greens
All brassica vegetables contain indole-3 carbinol, which helps the liver metabolize excess estrogen and prevent estrogen dominance (which is a common hormone imbalance that gives rise to a bunch of period problems, including PMS).

Coconut yogurt
Coconut yogurt contains probiotics in the form of live cultures (which helps the gut metabolize estrogen and keep hormones balanced) and it is rich in healthy fats, which help keep blood sugar stable.

Sweet potatoes
Sweet potatoes are naturally sweet and can help satisfy your sweet cravings. The vitamin A in sweet potatoes supports the liver as it metabolizes excess estrogen.

Bone broth
Bone broth can be a good source of magnesium and calcium, both of which can help alleviate the symptoms of PMS. ", I know that PMS exists but I want to know what are some foods that are considered good to eat?,"You can take a multi-pronged approach to ease the symptoms of PMS. Here are some of my top food, supplement, and lifestyle strategies. 

Let’s start with lifestyle. Here’s how to arrange your environment to help defeat PMS:

1. Stomp out inflammation.
Eat low inflammatory foods, like cruciferous vegetables, pastured eggs and pastured animal proteins, and nuts and seeds. Reduce the amount of sugar you eat or eliminate it altogether. A high-sugar diet drives up the production of advanced-glycation end products, which contribute to inflammation. Two foods that have been shown to help specifically with prostaglandin reduction are pomegranate and small, oily fish that contain high levels of inflammation-fighting omega-3 fatty acids.

2. Make “organic” and “clean” the main part of your life.
When you’re doing your grocery and you see that clean makeup products and organic foods are more expensive than the conventional option, it can be easy to make the wallet-friendly choice. But what you need to keep in mind in these moments is the true cost of the choice you’re making. The toxins in these foods and products come into direct contact with the body and alter endocrine function, making period problems like PMS worse. You may save at check-out, but you are ultimately paying with your health. Eat organic and clean whenever possible. 

3. Give up coffee.
This piece of advice is self-explanatory and, after the first week of withdrawal, not nearly as hard as you think. Within a month you won’t even miss it. Skip caffeinated tea, too. In case you’re tempted to skip tip #3, allow me to repeat myself: no more caffeine!

"Normal vaginal discharge occurs in white color It varies throughout your cycle, 
but it is common to have it at the beginning and the end of your cycle.
