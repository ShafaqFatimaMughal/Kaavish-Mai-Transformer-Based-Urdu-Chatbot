"The week before your periods, if you have too much estrogen relative to progesterone, you can experience PMS (premenstrual syndrome) symptoms, including insomnia. Estrogen dominance is triggered by a long list of common factors, including stress, lack of self-care, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, and exposure to environmental toxins. 
Some common environmental factors make the situation even worse. Drinking caffeine is one. If you have adrenal fatigue, you may experience PMS-related insomnia, where you lay in bed exhausted but can’t fall asleep. Micronutrient deficiencies, including low levels of magnesium, zinc, and/or selenium can also fuel the problem. Magnesium helps promote relaxation; selenium may help boost progesterone and bring your reproductive hormones back into balance; studies show that zinc can help improve sleep quantity and quality.

"Your cycle should last 26-32 days. Your bleed should be the color of cranberry juice, with no clots. A nice, strong, flow that isn’t inconveniently heavy.

You should be able to feel your uterus in action with some slight sensations or warm feelings, but there should not be any kind of pain that might have you reaching for drugs or hot water bottles.

"Experts believe PMS is triggered (in part) by cyclical changes in sex hormones each month. Monthly hormone shifts are normal and expected. They happen! But the root cause of the problem is when we have more or less estrogen and progesterone than we need.

If you address the underlying hormone imbalance with food and lifestyle, you can erase the symptoms of Pre Menstrual Syndrome.

Other research shows that women with high levels of stress around the time of ovulation have a harder time getting pregnant.

The blood sugar roller coaster, when your blood sugar is constantly going up and down thanks to eating high-sugar and refined carbohydrate foods, can also fuel missing or irregular periods. Imbalanced blood sugar is linked to infertility, and diabetes drugs like Metformin are often prescribed to women with PCOS to trigger ovulation.","I missed my periods and I don't have any of the famous causes, please help I am very scared that something is wrong with me"

","I have a sweet tooth and love eating sweet things, does that contribute to my PMS","Experts believe PMS is triggered (in part) by cyclical changes in sex hormones each month. Monthly hormone shifts are normal and expected. They happen! But the root cause of the problem is when we have more or less estrogen and progesterone than we need. As our bodies move through the 28-day hormone cycle in this hormonally imbalanced environment, that is when we experience symptoms. If you address the underlying hormone imbalance with food and lifestyle, you can erase the symptoms of Pre Menstrual Syndrome. Experts also believe that nutrient deficiencies play a role in PMS symptoms. Research has shown a connection between low levels of vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium and PMS symptoms. ",What causes Pre Menstrual Syndrome?,"Take self-care seriously. The more stressed you are, the harder you need to work to manage and mitigate stress. Scan your life for stressors you can change, and then do so! The single best way to address blood sugar problems is with food. Emphasize healthy complex (and non-gluten) carbs, eat enough healthy, high-quality fats and proteins, and make sure you front-load non-starchy vegetables in all colors of the rainbow. Go to bed earlier! Hormones are hugely affected by sleep. The 24-hour circadian cycle has a direct influence on, and is directly influenced by, our bodies master hormones. When we’re short on sleep, it’s almost impossible to get our hormones balanced.

"Sure! There are hormones that are involved and those are estrogen and progesterone. Levels of estrogen and progesterone are typically at their lowest. This causes the top layers of the lining to release and leave the body. After ovulation, this involves the Secretory Phase, that occurs from ovulation until the start of the next period. The uterine lining gets ready to support a pregnancy or to break down for menstruation. In this stage, progesterone rises. This causes the uterine lining to stop thickening and prepare for a fertilized egg. These hormones rise after ovulation and are highest during a period.

"The first stage is the follicular phase. It starts from the start of the period until ovulation.Throughout the menstrual cycle, there are multiple follicles (fluid filled sacs containing eggs) at different stages of development in both ovaries. The period ends about halfway through this phase. One follicle in one of the ovaries becomes the largest of all the follicles, called the dominant follicle and is the size of a grain of sand (1-2 cm). This follicle is the one prepared to be released at ovulation. For most people, the follicular phase lasts 10-22 days, but this can vary from cycle-to-cycle.

"Periods fluctuate when they first start. If you’ve had your period for a few years, it should generally be about the same length and volume each cycle.

"Vaginal discharge is any non-period fluid that leaves your vagina. It is mostly water. There are also tiny microorganisms, including bacteria, present.

Discharge can include vaginal lubrication, arousal fluid, semen after having sex, and cervical fluid, or possibly discharge from bacterial growth or an infection.

This increase in moisture, or “wetness”, is vaginal lubrication or arousal fluid.",I would also like to know what is arousal fluid,"Cervical fluid is produced by the cells of your cervix. The cervix is the opening to the uterus from the vagina. Cervical fluid can change throughout your cycle from thick, creamy, and sticky to thin, wet, and slippery. 

When the hormone estrogen increases right before ovulation, cervical fluid thins. This makes it easier for sperm to move through the cervix. This thinning may make it look like there is an increase in discharge and it may seem stretchier. When the hormone progesterone increases, cervical mucus thickens."

"It’s common not to have heard about bacterial vaginosis (BV) until you notice an issue with your own fluid. BV happens when the normal balance of vaginal bacteria is replaced by high numbers of anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that don’t need oxygen to grow). The most common type of BV-causing bacteria is called Gardnerella. The digestion processes of the new bacterial community create different byproducts and environmental changes, which can lead to symptoms from a fishy or unpleasant odor to itching, discomfort and inflammation. An immune response is also triggered in the vagina and can degrade the vagina’s naturally protective mucus. This can make the reproductive tract more prone to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like HIV and chlamydia.

In one study of people taking these medications, participants had decreased sebum production and improved perceived hair quality. Sebum production is influenced by your hormones, particularly androgens (like testosterone).

Estrogen also influences sebum production, especially at high doses.

One study had an interesting finding: even if more bad hair days were registered around the time of menstruation, they did not correlate with increases in scalp sebum levels. There was not a clear explanation for the bad hair days—perhaps it’s due to a difference in participants’ personal perception of their hair. Is the change on your head or in your head?

If you notice brown period blood at the start or end of your period, it’s because the blood is older and took longer to leave your uterus. The uterine lining darkens the longer it takes to leave the body.

Period blood clots are normal on the heaviest days of your period and can appear deep red or almost dark black as well.","I noticed different colours of blood throughout my period, do they have any significance","Blood changes color depending on how long it has been exposed to air oxygenation. When you get your periods, your endometrium (inner lining of your uterus) does not separate all at once, it takes time for your endometrial tissue to make its way down through your cervix and vagina. This initial blood and tissue may appear dark red or brown, or even black because it takes longer to exit your body. As tissue breaks away, it leaves torn ends of blood vessels that continue to bleed. This is where the bright red blood you may see during your period comes from.

Your menstrual period lasts longer than seven days.
Your flow soaks through tampons or pads every hour for a few hours in a row.
You need to change pads or tampons during the night.
You have multiple grape-sized (or larger) blood clots.
Your heavy menstrual flow keeps you from doing things you would normally do.
You are tired, have a lack of energy or are short of breath.
You feel heavy pain in your abdomen and lower back.

"As ovulation approaches, your body produces more cervical fluid. You can see this fluid in your underwear or on toilet paper when you use the bathroom.

These lumps can grow on the inner and outer surfaces of the uterus, as well as within the uterine wall.

Periods that are heavy, long, and/or painful
Irregular bleeding 
Pelvic pressure or pain 
Frequent urination and difficulty emptying the bladder
Constipation 
Difficulty getting pregnant or carrying to term
In rare cases, uterine fibroids can become very large, twisted, or infected. These situations can create intense symptoms, and may require immediate medical treatment.

"Yes! There are different types of fibroids which can create different symptoms. Fibroids embedded within the uterine wall (intramural fibroids) can change the shape of the uterus, which may cause changes in fertility.

2. Get supplies that you feel comfortable using. Schools usually stock their menstrual products in two places: the girls’ bathrooms and the nurse’s office.

If they don’t, grab some small change just in case you need to use a vending machine to purchase supplies. If your teacher asks what’s happening and you don’t feel comfortable discussing your period in front of others, “stomach problems” are a good go-to.

2. Get supplies that you feel comfortable using. Schools usually stock their menstrual products in two places: the girls’ bathrooms and the nurse’s office.
If you are in class, ask to be excused. Ask a friend who menstruates if they have an extra pad or tampon you could borrow.

",What to do if I get my periods at school,"In short, yes! Painful menstruation has been linked to working in jobs that are low control, are unsecure and have low coworker support. Stress from the preceding month may also affect the frequency of dysmenorrhea, so someone might not experience painful menstruation as a result of stress until their period the following month. Similarly, people experiencing stress earlier in their cycle were more likely to report severe symptoms during the time leading up to and during menstruation.",I have a very stressful life. Does that affect my period pain?,"There is a possibility that daily life stress affects the length of your cycle. One study of stress in female nurses found associations between high stress and both anovulation and longer cycles, though these findings may be in part due to rotating shift work (working nights), which is common for nurses. Conversely, high stress jobs have also been associated with shorter cycles. Differences in levels and length of stress exposure could cause people’s bodies to respond in different ways. For example, in one study, perimenopausal (approaching menopause) people with high stress were no more likely to have altered cycles than low stress people after one year; however, high stress was linked to shorter menstrual cycles after two years, indicating that symptoms may not present immediately.", Can my daily life stresses affect how long I get my period?,"Yes, it does! Stress activates a hormonal pathway in the body called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Activation of the HPA axis is associated with increased levels of cortisol and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The HPA axis, cortisol, and CRH help control stress response in the body. CRH and cortisol release can suppress normal levels of reproductive hormones, potentially leading to abnormal ovulation, anovulation (i.e. no ovulation), or amenorrhea (i.e. absence of menstruation). Furthermore, abnormal levels of CRH in reproductive tissue have been associated with negative pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth"
"Before your next period comes, stock up on whatever collection methods you use and make sure you have a few spare pads or tampons in each backpack and purse that you take with you most often. If you use non-disposables like period panties, or washable cotton pads to manage your bleeding, remember to also bring a resealable bag or container you can store used ones in with you in case you would need to change them during the day.

"The vagina is the tube between the vulva and the cervix. This tube is the connection between your uterus and the outside world. The vagina is what babies exit through during birth, and what menstrual blood exits through during your period. The vagina is also used for insertion, such as with a penis, fingers, female condoms, sex toys, tampons, or menstrual cups.

The vagina can also act as a route to other parts of the body. During penis-vagina sex, ejaculate is deposited in the vagina, allowing sperm to enter the uterus through the cervix. The walls of the vagina can also be used as an administrative route for medications and contraceptives, such as intervaginal hormone creams, the hormonal vaginal contraceptive ring, or vaginal suppository medications.",What is a vagina?,"That is a nice question, a lot of people don't know that vulva and vagin are two different parts.

How can I help?"
"Yes, it does. The vagina can change a lot throughout a person's life. An average adult vagina is slightly curved, but every body is different, and there’s no such thing as a too small or too large vagina.

The vagina is strongly influenced by hormonal changes throughout the body. During the reproductive years after menarche (the first menstrual period) and before menopause, more layers of tissue are present lining the vagina, due to stimulation from higher estrogen levels in the body.

After menopause, when estrogen is lower, the walls of the vagina become thinner and frailer, which can cause symptoms of vaginal dryness and decreased vaginal secretions. This may result in discomfort during sex and increase the chances of vaginal irritation or infection ",Does my vagina change with age?,"The vagina is the tube between the vulva and the cervix. This tube is the connection between your uterus and the outside world. The vagina is what babies exit through during birth, and what menstrual blood exits through during your period. The vagina is also used for insertion, such as with a penis, fingers, female condoms, sex toys, tampons, or menstrual cups.

The vagina can also act as a route to other parts of the body. During penis-vagina sex, ejaculate is deposited in the vagina, allowing sperm to enter the uterus through the cervix. The walls of the vagina can also be used as an administrative route for medications and contraceptives, such as intervaginal hormone creams, the hormonal vaginal contraceptive ring, or vaginal suppository medications.",What is a vagina?,"That is a nice question, a lot of people don't know that vulva and vagin are two different parts.

This shape change happens as the uterus and cervix are drawn higher into the pelvis, which creates more space and moves the cervix farther away from any semen that is ejaculated into the vagina. This allows time for the semen to mix with female genital fluids, stimulating the sperm to undergo the physical changes necessary for fertilizing an egg",I am curious of how my vagina (private part) changes during sex
"You taught me a lot, thanks","The contraceptive pill prevents the lining of your uterus (your endometrium) from growing thicker, as it would in a typical menstrual cycle. It also prevents ovulation and the typical cycling of reproductive hormones. When you have withdrawal bleeding, the bleeding tends to be lighter than normal menstrual bleeding.

It also prevents ovulation and the typical cycling of reproductive hormones. When you have withdrawal bleeding, the bleeding tends to be lighter than normal menstrual bleeding.",Why is my bleeding different on the contraceptive pill?,"No. If you take your pill consistently and correctly, you shouldn’t ovulate. This is the primary way the pill prevents pregnancy. In a usual (no-pill) cycle, the body’s natural reproductive hormones fluctuate up and down, taking your body through a process of preparing an egg for release, releasing that egg, and preparing your uterus to accept a potentially fertilized egg.

The hormones in the contraceptive pill stop and prevent your ovaries from preparing and releasing eggs. They stop the usual hormonal “cycling”, including ovulation, the typical growth of the endometrium, and the natural period, meaning you ideally should not be ovulating and can't get pregnant if taken correctly.",Do I ovulate on the contraceptive pill?,"If you want to wash your vagina, you should wash do it with warm water. If you’d like, you can use a mild soap that won’t irritate the skin — but this isn’t necessary. Spread your lips apart and gently cleanse around the folds, using a clean washcloth or your hands. Avoid getting water or soap inside your vagina.

In addition to washing your vulva, it’s a good idea to wash the anus and the area between your vulva and anus every day. It’s best to wash “front to back” — in other words, wash your vulva first and then your anus. Otherwise, bacteria from the anus can spread to your vagina, which can cause infections.",How to clean my vagina?,"The vagina can undergo more rapid changes, such as during sexual activity. When a person with a vagina is sexually aroused, increased blood flow is directed towards the genitals, causing the vaginal tissue to become engorged with blood, and additional lubrication to be produced.

Menopause is a normal life phase, but can also be induced by surgery, drug treatments, or medication. It technically begins after your last menstrual period, but your healthcare provider will consider you to have reached menopause after 12 months without a period"

"Uterine polyps occur when cells of the uterine lining (the endometrium) multiply too many times, leading to lumps. These lumps often resemble hanging sacs or mushrooms made of tissue. Most are very small, but can range in size from a few millimeters, to several centimeters in diameter. Polyps can be numerous or few, and some people might only have one. 

To give you some more information, some people are more likely than others to develop uterine polyps. They are most common in people who are perimenopausal and postmenopausal. If you are obese, you must also know that obesity also makes people significantly more likely to develop polyps. If you have taken the the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, this can be a contributing factor too.

"Uterine polyps are similar to a type of uterine fibroids (they form from muscle tissue in the uterus, but can cause many of the same symptoms, as well as other ones).  The biggest difference is that fibroids are more likely to be problematic in the reproductive years and shrink after menopause, while polyps are more likely to be problematic after menopause, so really depends on what phase you are in at the moment. ",Are uterine polyps and uterine fibroids similar or different?,"Uterine polyps occur when cells of the uterine lining (the endometrium) multiply too many times, leading to lumps. These lumps often resemble hanging sacs or mushrooms made of tissue. Most are very small, but can range in size from a few millimeters, to several centimeters in diameter. Polyps can be numerous or few, and some people might only have one. 

To give you some more information, some people are more likely than others to develop uterine polyps. They are most common in people who are perimenopausal and postmenopausal. If you are obese, you must also know that obesity also makes people significantly more likely to develop polyps. If you have taken the the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, this can be a contributing factor too.
