Salam Mai. I had a question,Sure. Ask away.
is using cloth sanitary,"Cloth pads can be safe to use as long as they are used hygienically. Cloth pads must be washed properly, dried under sunlight, and stored in dry and sterile places. Remember, when menstrual and personal hygiene is not practised, it can lead to infection. So be careful about it"
ok,Do you want to ask something else
Is menstruation and periods the same thing,"Yes, they are"
is it normal to have different coloured discharge?,"Yes, Healthy vaginal discharge ranges from clear to a milky white, with as many shades in between as you'll find in a paint store. And it's common for the texture and color to change throughout your menstrual cycle"
is it normal to bleed very heavily sometimes and less another,"This may happen. Periods fluctuate when they first start. If you’ve had your period for a few years, it should generally be about the same length and volume each cycle. You may still notice changes from time to time, such as the heaviness and length of your period which can fluctuate, depending on your hormones. Hormones can change temporarily because of things like stress, diet, or taking an emergency contraception pill.  Your period will also have variations if you don’t ovulate each cycle—you may miss a period, or come later than usual, and/or be heavier/lighter and shorter/longer than your usual. Not ovulating during each cycle is common during adolescence and perimenopause, and is a common cause of temporarily absent and/or heavy menstrual periods."
is it normal to leave stains,Are you referring to spotting?
Yes,"After your period, the bleeding may taper off slowly. You may only notice a little blood on the toilet paper you use to wipe, or you may see stains accumulate on your underwear throughout the day. This is all considered normal."
are you impure if you are on your period,"Neither you or your period blood is impure in scientific terms. Unless a woman has a blood-borne illness, menstrual fluid is harmless. No toxins are released in menstrual flow, as this is a lining that must be pure and clean enough to have nurtured a baby. Menstrual fluid is no more dangerous than regular blood. Your organs release many secretions in the body, and your whole body has blood inside it too. If it was toxic or harmful, you would not be alive!"
is it normal to have bad moods,"Bad moods or mood swings before your periods can be part of the pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). It's normal to have the blues or feel sick before and during a period. As hormone levels rise and fall during a girl's menstrual cycle, it can affect the way she feels, both physically and emotionally. Do you want to know what is PMS?"
Yes,"Experts believe PMS is triggered (in part) by cyclical changes in sex hormones each month. Monthly hormone shifts are normal and expected. They happen! But the root cause of the problem is when we have more or less estrogen and progesterone than we need. As our bodies move through the 28-day hormone cycle in this hormonally imbalanced environment, that is when we experience symptoms. If you address the underlying hormone imbalance with food and lifestyle, you can erase the symptoms of Pre Menstrual Syndrome. Experts also believe that nutrient deficiencies play a role in PMS symptoms. Research has shown a connection between low levels of vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium and PMS symptoms. "
if i bleed during pregnancy does that mean i’ve had a miscarriage?,"During the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, vaginal bleeding can be a sign of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. However, if you bleed at this stage of pregnancy it's likely you will go on to have normal and successful pregnancies."
Is it normal for my periods to be a couple days late,"Missed or late periods happen for many reasons other than pregnancy. Common causes can range from hormonal imbalances to serious medical conditions. There are also two times when it's typical for your period to be irregular: when it first begins, and when the menopause transition starts."
what is the earliest age that I can get my period,"Most girls start their periods when they're about 12, but they can start as early as 8, so it's important to talk to girls from an early age to make sure they're prepared."
Why do I feel so depressed during my periods,"Bad moods or mood swings before your periods can be part of the pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). It's normal to have the blues or feel sick before and during a period. As hormone levels rise and fall during a girl's menstrual cycle, it can affect the way she feels, both physically and emotionally."
when should I see a doctor for cramps and pain,"For most women, cramping and bloating are typical symptoms of the “friend” who pays a monthly visit. But when the pain is extreme and paired with excessive bleeding, fever, or feels suddenly worse than what has been previously experienced, it's time to see your doctor. If you have very painful menstrual cramps or cramps that last longer than two or three days, make an appointment with your healthcare provider."
should I take medicine for pain or discomfort,"You can take painkillers only if your healthcare provider suggests it. Otherwise, you can use natural remedies for the period pain. Would you like to know them?"
Yes,"Standard period pain responds well to natural supplements such as zinc, turmeric and magnesium. Supplements work gently and gradually, so they must be taken every day throughout the month — not just during your period."
is it harmful to take meds during periods,"Everyones body is different, it may or may not be harmful. Please refer to your healthcare provider for further information"
what can I do to relieve the pain,"Standard period pain responds well to natural supplements such as zinc, turmeric and magnesium. Supplements work gently and gradually, so they must be taken every day throughout the month — not just during your period."
is it bad to not get periods for months,"With the exception of missing your period while on some contraceptives, it is not normal to go without a period for several months and can be harmful to your health. Visit your physician if your missed periods persist."
Do some girls have increased sex drive during periods?,"Many women report having an increased libido (sex drive) during menstruation, while the chances of getting pregnant on your period are very low, the increase in sex drive is caused by a drop in the levels of progesterone (a hormone)"
Sometimes I get pain on the 14/15th day of my cycle on one side of my abdomen.. why is that?,"Some women get a one-sided pain in their lower abdomen when they ovulate. It happens about 14 days before your period, when an ovary releases an egg as part of the menstrual cycle. Ovulation pain is often normal"
What are symptoms of ovulation pain,The pain can be a dull cramp or a sharp and sudden twinge. It's usually on either the left- or right-hand side of your tummy depending on which ovary is releasing the egg. It can last just a few minutes or continue for a day or 2. Some women notice a little vaginal bleeding when it happens.
