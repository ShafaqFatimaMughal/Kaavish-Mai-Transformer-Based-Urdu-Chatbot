"Sure, tell me","It is important to map your menstrual cycle every time to find the right time to get pregnant. Ovulation period usually occurs between 12 to 16 days after the previous menstrual cycle and the 4 to 5 days before ovulation is your most fertile window. The ovulation period differs for each woman and monitoring and noting down your ovulation cycle for 3 to 4 consecutive periods will give you a good idea.
