I don't know anything about Infraradian Rhythm. Can you please help me learn about it?,"Sure. The infradian rhythm is one of the two internal timekeepers experienced by women. People with male physiology only experience the circadian rhythm. People with female physiology experience both. The infradian rhythm (and its four phases) track with your menstrual cycle, and alongside affecting the reproductive hormones, it also has an influence the other parts of your body. The infradian rhythm affects our physiology cyclically which is why it supports your body in a cyclical way too. As a woman yourself, in order to have optimal hormonal and overall health, it is ideal that you eat, move, supplement and live in line with this infradian rhythm, which is expressed in your mesntrual cycle in four distinct phases, namely the follicular, ovulatory, luteal and menstrual phase.",mein infraradian rhythm ke baray mein kuch nahi jaanta. kya aap is ke baray mein jan-nay mein meri madad kar satke hain ?,"zaroor! infradian rhythm un do androoni timekeepers mein se aik hai jis ka tajurbah khawateen ne kya hai. mardana physiology walay log sirf circadian taal/rhythm/rhythm ka tajurbah karte hain. khawateen physiology dono ka tajurbah karte hain. infradian rhythm ( aur is ke chaar marahil ) aap ke mahvari ke sath track karta hai, aur toleedi/reproductive hormones ko mutasir karne ke sath, yeh aap ke jism ke dosray hisson par bhi assar andaaz hota hai. infradian taal/rhythm hamari physiology ko chakarati tor par mutasir karta hai jis ki wajah se yeh aap ke jism ko chakarati andaaz mein bhi sahara deta hai. khud aik aurat honay ke natey, behtareen hormonal aur majmoi sehat ke liye, yeh misali hai ke aap khayen, harkat karen, is ki takmeel karen aur is infradian rhythm ke mutabiq rahen, jis ka izhaar aap ke mahvari mein chaar allag allag marahil mein hota hai, yani follicular, ovulatory, luteal aur mahvari ka marhala ."
What happens to my body when I am in the menstrual phase I want to know what happens to my body when I am in the menstrual phase,"Thank you for asking that! A few changes happen. The corpus luteum ( it is a vital yet temporary organ that plays a crucial role in fertility) in your body gets reabsorbed. Simultaneously, progesterone levels decline, your uterus sheds the thick endometrial lining that it has built up in the luteal phase and estrogen hits its lowest point just before your bleed",jab mein mahvari ke marhalay mein hon to mere jism ke sath kya hota hai mein janna chahti hon ke jab mein mahvari ke marhalay mein hon to mere jism ke sath kya hota hai,"yeh poochnay ke liye aap ka shukriya! chand tabdeelian hoti hain. aap ke jism mein corpus luteum ( yeh aik ahem aarzi uzoo/organ hai jo zarkhaizi mein aik ahem kirdaar ada karta hai ) dobarah jazb ho jata hai. is ke sath hi, progestrone ki satah mein kami aati hai, aap ka bacha daani/uterus is moti endometrial aster/lining ko baha deta hai jo is ne luteal marhalay mein banaya tha aur estrogen aap ke khoon se bilkul pehlay –apne sab se nichale maqam par pahonch jata hai ."
Does any changes occur in my brain too?,"Yes, it does! The left (analytical) and right (feeling) hemispheres of your brain communicate the most during this time, which means it’s a great time to integrate how you feel about situations in your life and make decisions about how to proceed. This is an ideal time to reflect and journal. ",kya mere dimagh mein bhi koi tabdeeli aati hai ?,"jee haan! aap ke dimagh ke baen ( tjzyati/analytical ) aur dayen ( ehsas/feeling ) hissa is waqt ke douran sab se ziyada baat cheet karte hain, jis ka matlab hai ke yeh aik behtareen waqt hai ke aap apni zindagi ke halaat ke baray mein kaisa mehsoos karte hain aur agay bherne ke baray mein faislay karen. yeh akkaasi (sochnay) aur jareeday/journal ka behtareen waqt hai ."
When does the Follicular Phase happen,Your follicular phase happens 7 to 10 days after your period ends. ,follicular marhala kab hota hai ?,aap ka follicular marhala aap ki mahvari khatam honay ke 7 se 10 din baad hota hai .
How does my body change during the follicular phase,"A few changes occur. Your reproductive hormones are at their lowest level (which is where they were during your bleed) during the first part of this phase. Estrogen starts to ramp up during the later part of this phase and the lining of your uterus starts to thicken. Your ovaries get ready to release an egg during ovulation (the next phase, metabolism is slower and resting cortisol levels are lower. No significant progesterone or testosterone production during this time and you can feel a little tired during this phase if your hormones are unbalanced.",follicular marhalay ke douran mera jism kaisay badalta hai ?,chand tabdeelian runuma hoti hain. is marhalay ke pehlay hissay ke douran aap ke toleedi/reproductive hormones apni kam tareen satah par hain ( jo woh jagah hai jahan woh aap ke khoon ke douran thay ). is marhalay ke aakhri hissay ke douran estrogen barhna shuru ho jata hai aur aap ke reham ki parat gaarha hona shuru ho jati hai. beza daani/ovary ke douran aap ki beza daani/ovary anda chorney ke liye tayyar ho jati hai ( aglay marhalay mein metabolism sust hota hai aur aaraam karne par cortisol ki satah kam hoti hai. is douran koi khaas progestrone ya testosterone ki pedawar nahi hoti hai aur agar aap ke hormones ghair mutawazan hain to aap is marhalay ke douran thakawat mehsoos kar satke hain .
What happens to my brain when I am in my follicular phase,"The subtle increase in estrogen has you interested in planning out new things and exploring new ideas during this time. Symbolically, this is a phase of new beginnings. ",jab mein apne follicular marhalay mein hon to mere dimagh ko kya hota hai .,"estrogen mein theek theek izafay ne aap ko is waqt ke douran nai cheezon ki mansoobah bandi karne aur naye ideas talaash karne mein dilchaspi li hai. allamti tor par, yeh nai shuruvaat ka aik marhala hai ."
When does the Ovulatory Phase happen,"It happens 3 to 4 days in the middle of your cycle, right after the follicular phase (which lasts for 7 to 10 days) and before the luteal phase (which is the phase just before your period).",ovulatory marhala kab hota hai .,"yeh aap ke chakkar ke wast mein 3 se 4 din hota hai, follicular marhalay ke theek baad ( jo 7 se 10 din tak rehta hai ) aur luteal marhalay se pehlay ( jo ke aap ki mahvari se bilkul pehlay ka marhala hai ) ."
What happens to my body when I am in the ovulatory phase,A few changes occur in your body. Estrogen surges and luteinizing hormone (LH) arrives on the scene to spark the release of an egg. The lining of your uterus gets thicker and testosterone surges then quickly goes back down,jab mein ovulatory marhalay mein hon to mere jism ko kya hota hai .,aap ke jism mein kuch tabdeelian runuma hoti hain. estrogen surges aur luteinizing hormone ( lh ) jaye waqooa par pahonch kar anday ke ikhraj ko bhrhkate hain. aap ke bacha daani/uterus ki aster/lining moti ho jati hai aur testosterone barh jata hai phir taizi se neechay chala jata hai .
What happens to my brain when I am in the ovulatory phase,"The hormone shift during this phase activates the verbal and social areas of your brain. You’re apt to feel your most social and communicative during this phase, and it is a good time to plan conversations with friends and significant others. ",jab mein ovulatory marhalay mein hon to mere dimagh ko kya hota hai .,"is marhalay ke douran hormone ki tabdeeli aap ke dimagh ke zabani aur samaji ilaqon ko mutharrak karti hai. aap is marhalay ke douran –apne sab se ziyada samaji aur baat cheet ko mehsoos karne ke liye mozoon hain, aur yeh doston aur ahem logon ke sath baat cheet ki mansoobah bandi karne ka aik acha waqt hai ."
i do not remember the next phase after the ovulatory phase,"Don't worry, I am here to tell you. The luteal phase is the phase that happens after ovulation",mujhe ovulatory marhalay ke baad agla marhala yaad nahi hai .,"pareshan nah hon, mein aap ko batanay ke liye haazir hon. luteal marhala woh marhala hai jo ovulation ke baad hota hai ."
How long does it lasts,It happens 10 to 14 days after ovulation and before your bleed.,yeh kitni der tak rehta hai .,yeh ovulation ke 10 se 14 din baad aur aap ke khoon se pehlay hota hai .
What happens to my body when I am in the luteal phase,"A few changes occur in your body. Estrogen levels continue to rise, your uterine lining continues to thicken and your progesterone levels start to rise. Toward the end of the luteal phase, estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone peak and then begin to drop, hitting their lowest levels just before your period. Pre Menstrual Syndrome during this phase is caused by too much estrogen in the body relative to progesterone, or estrogen dominance and metabolism speeds up.",jab mein luteal marhalay mein hon to mere jism ko kya hota hai .,"aap ke jism mein kuch tabdeelian runuma hoti hain. estrogen ki satah barhti rehti hai, aap ke reham ki aster/lining gaarhi hoti rehti hai aur aap ke progestrone ki satah bherne lagti hai. Luteal marhalay ke ekhtataam ki taraf, estrogen, testosterone, aur progestrone chouti aur phir girna shuru kar dete hain, aap ki mahvari se ain pehlay apni nichli satah ko maartay hain. is marhalay ke douran premenstrual syndrome hoti hai jisme jism mein progestrone ki nisbat bohat ziyada estrogen ki wajah se hota hai, ya estrogen ka ghalba aur metabolism taiz kardeta hai ."
Does my brain change in this phase too?,"Yes, it does. In fact, your brain goes through changes in every phase. Hormone levels during this phase prime your brain to be good at focusing on details and wrapping up projects. Towards the end of this phase, as your hormone levels plummet, you will have less energy and feel more inclined to focus inward rather than on socializing. ",kya is marhalay mein mera dimagh bhi badal jata hai ?,"haan yeh hota hai. dar haqeeqat, aap ka dimagh har marhalay mein tabdeelion se guzarta hai. is marhalay ke douran hormone ki satah aap ke dimagh ko tafseelaat par tawajah markooz karne aur projects ko semathnay mein acha banati hai. is marhalay ke ekhtataam ki taraf, jaisay jaisay aap ke hormone ki satah kam hoti jaye gi, aap ko tawanai kam hogi aur aap samaji honay ki bajaye andar ki taraf tawajah markooz karne ke liye ziyada mael mehsoos karen ge ."

Hi,"Hello I am Mai, nice to meet you.",hi,"hello mein Mai hon, aap se mil kar khushi hui ."
I was having insomnia and the following week I got my periods. Is there any link between them?,"The week before your periods, if you have too much estrogen relative to progesterone, you can experience PMS (premenstrual syndrome) symptoms, including insomnia. Estrogen dominance is triggered by a long list of common factors, including stress, lack of self-care, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, and exposure to environmental toxins. 
Some common environmental factors make the situation even worse. Drinking caffeine is one. If you have adrenal fatigue, you may experience PMS-related insomnia, where you lay in bed exhausted but can’t fall asleep. Micronutrient deficiencies, including low levels of magnesium, zinc, and/or selenium can also fuel the problem. Magnesium helps promote relaxation; selenium may help boost progesterone and bring your reproductive hormones back into balance; studies show that zinc can help improve sleep quantity and quality. ",mujhe be khwabi/insomnia ho rahi thi aur aglay haftay mujhe mahvari aa gayi. kya un ke darmiyan koi rabt hai ?,"aap ki mahvari se aik hafta pehlay, agar aap ke paas progestrone ki nisbat bohat ziyada estrogen hai, to aap PMS ( premenstrual syndrome ) ki alamaat ka tajurbah kar satke hain, Bashmole be khwabi/insomnia. estrogen ka ghalba aam awamil ki aik taweel fehrist se shuru hota hai, Bashmole tanao, khud ki dekh bhaal ki kami, naaqis khoraak, micronutrients ki kami, magnesium, zinc aur selenium bhi is maslay ko sun-hwa day sakta hai. magnesium aaraam ko farogh dainay mein madad karta hai. selenium progestrone ko badhaane aur aap ke toleedi/reproductive hormones ko dobarah tawazun mein laane mein madad kar sakta hai. mtalaat se pata chalta hai ke zank neend ki miqdaar aur miyaar ko behtar bananay mein madad kar sakta hai. 
 kuch aam maholiyati awamil sorat e haal ko mazeed kharab kar dete hain. caffeine piinaa aik hai. agar aap ko adrenal thakawat hai, to aap pms se mutaliq be khwabi/insomnia ka tajurbah kar satke hain, jahan aap thakey hare bistar par laitay hain lekin so nahi satke."
Why does my khala go through insomnia before her periods but I don't,"The hormone imbalance is made worse if your progesterone levels are low overall—which can affect women of every age, but which happens more often to women over age 35. If your khala is older than 35, then this may be it. That’s because overall progesterone levels start trending downward during perimenopause, and lower progesterone negatively impacts the production of melatonin, which is required to fall asleep and stay asleep. Progesterone also promotes relaxation, and without enough of it, you will have trouble falling asleep easily. Progesterone is good for sleep.",meri khala ko mahvari se pehlay be khwabi/insomnia kyun hoti hai lekin mujhe nahi hoti,"agar aap ke progestrone ki satah majmoi tor par kam ho to hormone ka adam tawazun mazeed kharab ho jata hai — jo har umar ki khawateen ko mutasir kar sakta hai, lekin yeh aksar 35 saal se ziyada umar ki khawateen mein hota hai. is ki wajah yeh hai ke perimenopause ke douran progestrone ki majmoi satah neechay ki taraf bherne lagti hai, aur kam progestrone melatonin ki pedawar par manfi assar dalta hai, jis ki neend anay aur sonay ke liye zaroori hai. progestrone bhi aaraam ko farogh deta hai, aur is ki kaafi miqdaar ke baghair, aap ko aasani se neend anay mein pareshani hogi. progestrone neend ke liye acha hai ."
"This actually made me think, what classifies as a normal, healthy or perfect period?","Your cycle should last 26-32 days. Your bleed should be the color of cranberry juice, with no clots. A nice, strong, flow that isn’t inconveniently heavy. Your period should really start first thing in the morning, without any brown stains leading up to the appearance of that cranberry red. And it should last 4-7 days, not longer or shorter. You should be able to feel your uterus in action with some slight sensations or warm feelings, but there should not be any kind of pain that might have you reaching for drugs or hot water bottles. After your period, leading up to ovulation, you should see the development of cervical fluid, which is an indicator of healthy fertility and necessary for getting pregnant. 
","mai soch rahi thi ke aik aam, sehat mand ya kaamil mahvari kaisa hona chahiye ?","aap ka cycle 26-32 din tak chalna chahiye. aap ke khoon ka rang cranberry ya anaar ke juice ka hona chahiye, baghair kisi jamnay ke. aik acha, mazboot, bahao jo mushkil se bhaari nahi hai. aap ki mahvari waqai sab se pehlay subah se shuru honi chahiye, baghair kisi bhooray daagh ke jo cranberry ya anaar jaisa surkh ki shakal ka baais banay. aur yeh 4-7 din tak rehna chahiye, ziyada ya chhota nahi. aap ko thora sa ehsas ya garam ehsasat ke sath –apne bacha daani/uterus ko harkat mein mehsoos karne ke qabil hona chahiye, lekin kisi qisam ka dard nahi hona chahiye jo aap ko manshiat ya garam pani ki bottlon tak pounchanay par majboor kar sakta hai. aap ki mahvari ke baad, beza daani/ovary tak, aap ko cervical fluid ki nashonuma dekhna chahiye, jo ke sehat mand zarkhaizi ka ishara hai aur haamla honay ke liye zaroori hai ."
"My periods have stopped coming, but I am not married. Is something wrong with me?","There are some well-known, “textbook” reasons that periods disappear, like pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause.

There’s also engaging in too much exercise. As you may know, too much of anything is never healthy. Extreme exercise can lead to hormonal imbalance, so can eating too little and/or being underweight. Finally, a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which cysts grow on your ovaries, can stop ovulation in young women.

One of the top triggers for missing periods is coming off hormonal birth control. And stopping the pill doesn’t guarantee that your period will come right back. In fact, without making a concentrated effort through food and lifestyle modifications, many women who quit the pill do not start bleeding again for months or years.","meri mahvari aana band ho gayi hai, lekin meri shadi nahi hui hai. kya mere sath kuch ghalat hai ?","ya kam wazan hona? aakhir mein, polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) kehlanay wali aik haalat, jis mein aap ke beza daani/ovary par cyst barhatay hain, nojawan khawateen mein beza daani/ovary ko rokkk satke hain .

"I missed my periods and I don't have any of the famous causes, please help I am very scared that something is wrong with me","There are less talked about (but no less real) causes of missing or irregular periods, including stress. Chronic stress raises cortisol and messes up blood sugar, which disrupts ovulation. Studies also show that women with stressful jobs are at double the risk for anovulation (not ovulating) and menstrual cycle variability. Other research shows that women with high levels of stress around the time of ovulation have a harder time getting pregnant.

The blood sugar roller coaster/lining, when your blood sugar is constantly going up and down thanks to eating high-sugar and refined carbohydrate foods, can also fuel missing or irregular periods. Imbalanced blood sugar is linked to infertility, and diabetes drugs like Metformin are often prescribed to women with PCOS to trigger ovulation.","mere mahvari chhuut gayi hai aur mere paas koi mashhoor wajah nahi hai, barah karam madad karen mein bohat darti hon ke mere sath kuch ghalat hai","tanao samait mahvari ke gayab honay ya be qaidgi ki wajohaat ke baray mein kam baat ki jati hai ( lekin kam haqeeqi nahi ). daimi tanao/chronic stress cortisol ko berhata hai aur blood sugar mein khlal dalta hai, jo beza daani/ovary mein khlal dalta hai. mtalaat se yeh bhi pata chalta hai ke tanao wali mlazmton/jobs wali khawateen ko ovulation ( beza nahi aana ) aur mahvari ki tabdeeli ka khatrah dugna hota hai. doosri tehqeeq se pata chalta hai ke beza daani/ovary ke waqt ziyada tanao wali khawateen ko haamla honay mein mushkil paish aati hai .

"I am tired of not getting my periods, I want it back","Take self-care seriously. The more stressed you are, the harder you need to work to manage and mitigate stress. Scan your life for stressors you can change, and then do so! The single best way to address blood sugar problems is with food. Emphasize healthy complex (and non-gluten) carbs, eat enough healthy, high-quality fats and proteins, and make sure you front-load non-starchy vegetables in all colors of the rainbow. Go to bed earlier! Hormones are hugely affected by sleep. The 24-hour circadian cycle has a direct influence on, and is directly influenced by, our bodies master/lining hormones. When we’re short on sleep, it’s almost impossible to get our hormones balanced. So make sleep a priority tonight (and every night!).","mein apne haiz nah anay se thak gayi hon, mein usay wapas chahti hon .","khud ki dekh bhaal ko sanjeedgi se len. aap jitna ziyada tanao ka shikaar hon ge, tanao ko sambhalay aur usay kam karne ke liye aap ko itna hi mushkil kaam karne ki zaroorat hai. apni zindagi ko un tanao ke liye scan karen jo aap tabdeel kar satke hain, aur phir aisa karen! blood sugar ke masail ko hal karne ka wahid behtareen tareeqa khoraak hai. sehat mand paicheeda ( aur non-gluten ) carbohydrate par zor den, kaafi sehat mand, aala qisam ki fat aur protein khayen, aur yakeeni banayen ke aap qous quzah ke tamam rangon mein ghair nashasta daar sabzian front load karen. jaldi sonay ki aadat daalein! neend se hormones bohat ziyada mutasir hotay hain. 24 ghantay ka carcadian cycle hamaray jism ke hormones par barah e raast assar dalta hai aur is se barah e raast mutasir hota hai. jab hamari neend kam hoti hai to hamaray hormones ko mutawazan rakhna taqreeban namumkin hota hai. lehaza aaj raat ( aur har raat! ) sonay ko tarjeeh den ."
What causes Pre Menstrual Syndrome?,"Experts believe PMS is triggered (in part) by cyclical changes in sex hormones each month. Monthly hormone shifts are normal and expected. They happen! But the root cause of the problem is when we have more or less estrogen and progesterone than we need. As our bodies move through the 28-day hormone cycle in this hormonally imbalanced environment, that is when we experience symptoms. If you address the underlying hormone imbalance with food and lifestyle, you can erase the symptoms of Pre Menstrual Syndrome. Experts also believe that nutrient deficiencies play a role in PMS symptoms. Research has shown a connection between low levels of vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium and PMS symptoms. ",Pre Menstrual syndrome ki kya wajah hai ?,"mahireen ka khayaal hai ke PMS har mah jinsi hormones mein cyclical tabdeelion se ( juzwi tor par ) shuru hota hai. mahana hormone ki tabdeelian aam aur mutawaqqa hain. woh hotay hain! lekin is maslay ki jarr is waqt hoti hai jab hamaray paas estrogen aur progestrone hamari zaroorat se ziyada ya kam ho. jab hamara jism is harmonal tor par ghair mutawazan mahol mein 28 din ke hormone cycle se guzarta hai, isi waqt hamein alamaat ka saamna karna parta hai. agar aap khoraak aur tarz zindagi ke sath bunyadi hormone ke Adam tawazun ko dur karte hain, to aap premenstrual syndrome ki alamaat ko mita satke hain. mahireen ka yeh bhi maanna hai ke PMS ki alamaat mein ghizaiyat ki kami aik kirdaar ada karti hai. tehqeeq ne vitamin d, calcium, aur magnesium ki kam satah aur pms alamaat ke darmiyan talluq zahir kya hai ."
"I have a sweet tooth and love eating sweet things, does that contribute to my PMS","Sugar is one of the most inflammatory foods you can eat — and more inflammation means more PMS. Cutting down on sugar is a must when you’re trying to tame PMS.

Please tell me if stress contributes to PMS,"We live in a society that places a high value on always being busy. If you ask someone how they’re doing or what’s new and they reply, “I’ve been SO busy,” it often sounds as much like a point of pride as it does a complaint. But we need to reverse our stance on stress. Research shows that the higher the level of our perceived stress, the worse our PMS—and that stress reduction techniques might be effective non-pharmaceutical interventions for easing PMS. So grab your yoga mat, go out and get some deep breaths surrounded by nature, or make more time for the leisure activity that relaxes you.",barah karam mujhe batayen ke kya tanao pms mein Muawin hai .,"hum aik aisay muashray mein rehtay hain jo hamesha masroof rehne ko bohat ahmiyat deta hai. agar aap kisi se puchhte hain ke woh kaisay kar rahay hain ya naya kya hai aur woh jawab dete hain,"" mein bohat masroof hon "", to yeh aksar itna hi fakhr ka maqam lagta hai jitna ke yeh shikayat karta hai. lekin hamein tanao par apna muaqqaf tabdeel karne ki zaroorat hai. tehqeeq se pata chalta hai ke hamaray samjhay jane walay tanao ki satah jitni ziyada hogi, hamara pms itna hi kharab hoga — aur yeh ke tanao ko kam karne ki technique pms ko kam karne ke liye muaser ghair dwasazi ki madaghalatien ho sakti hain. is liye apni yoga chitaai ko pakren, bahar jayen aur fitrat se ghiri hui kuch gehri sansen len, ya tafrehi sar garmion ke liye ziyada waqt nikalen jo aap ko sukoon bakhshti hai ."

Do I need to worry about inflammation making my PMS worse?,"Inflammation is a system-wide response to injury or stress, and it can be brought on by a large number of environmental factors, from eating unhealthy foods and being too sedentary to using toxic health and body care products. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that control the body’s inflammatory response and experts believe they can trigger many of the symptoms of PMS. (Prostaglandin overproduction is why some women get relief by taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen. NSAIDs block the synthesis of prostaglandins.)",kya mujhe soozish/inflammation ke baray mein fikar karne ki zaroorat hai jo mere PMS ko mazeed kharab karti hai ?,"soozish/inflammation chot ya tanao ke liye aik nizaam bhar mein rad-e-amal hai, aur yeh maholiyati awamil ki aik barri tadaad ke zariye laya ja sakta hai (ghair sehat bakhash ghazayein khanay aur zahreeley sehat aur jismani nighdasht ki masnoaat ke istemaal ke liye bohat ziyada baithy rehne se). prostaglandins hormone numa maday hain jo jism ke sozishi rad-e-amal ko control karte hain aur mahireen ka khayaal hai ke woh pms ki bohat si alamaat ko mutharrak kar satke hain. ( prostagladin ki ziyada pedawar isi wajah se kuch khawateen ko NSAIDs jaisay ibuprofen lainay se aaraam milta hai. NSAIDs prostagladins ki tarkeeb ko roktay hain. )"
Is there anything else that contributes to making my PMS worse,"Yes, carrying HIDDEN weight is one of them. While being overweight is associated with a greater risk of PMS, the real problem is how ‘fat’ you are on the inside, which is not reflected in how much you weigh. You can be skinny on the outside and overweight on the inside, your PMS might be telling you to address internal obesity. 

You might not be living in sync with your cycle. Research shows that our 28-day menstrual cycle affects our brain function, emotions, mood, sensory processing, appetite, and even our perception of pain.

"I don't want to go through PMS, please tell me to get rid of them once and for all","Here’s how to arrange your environment to help defeat PMS. Eat low inflammatory foods, like cruciferous vegetables, pastured eggs and pastured animal proteins, and nuts and seeds. Reduce the amount of sugar you eat. Eat pomegranate and small, oily fish that contain high levels of inflammation-fighting omega-3 fatty acids. Eat organic and clean whenever possible. Give up coffee. If you don’t exercise, eat a high-sugar diet and/or don’t have enough phytonutrient-rich vegetables on your plate, you might be overweight or obese, which are strongly correlated with PMS. When you start correcting what’s going on internally, you can see a reduction in symptoms. In the medical literature, high levels of stress are associated with more severe PMS, try to keep them low.","mein pms se guzarna nahi chahti, barah karam mujhe batayen ke aik baar aur hamesha ke liye un se chhutkara kaise haasil kar lon .","PMS ko shikast dene keliye apne mahool ko tarteeb dene ka tareeqa ye hai. kam soozish wali ghizaen khayen, jaisay masloob sabzian, churaye hue pastured anday aur churaye hue pastured janwaron ke protein, aur giri daar meway aur beej (nuts aur seeds). cheeni ki miqdaar ko kam karen jo aap khatay hain. aanar aur choti tail wali machhli khayen jis mein soozish/inflammation se larnay walay omega 3 fatty acids ki aala satah hoti hai. jab bhi mumkin ho namiati aur saaf khayen. coffee chore do. agar aap werzish nahi karte hain, ziyada sugar wali ghiza khayen aur / ya aap ki plate mein kaafi ghizaiyat se bharpoor sabzian nahi hain, to aap ka wazan ziyada ya motapa ho sakta hai, jis ka PMS ke sath mazboot talluq hai. jab aap androoni tor par kya ho raha hai usay durust karna shuru karte hain, aap alamaat mein kami dekh satke hain. tibbi literature mein, aala satah ka tanao ziyada shadeed pms se munsalik hota hai, inhen kam rakhnay ki koshish karen ."
Why is syncing with your cycle important?,"Yes! All of the biohacks will only get you so far if you don’t start to live in accordance with your cycle. Eating and exercising for each week-long phase of your 28-day cycle is the foundation of feeling better and having a symptom-free period. For too long, we’ve been living the same way day in and day out. This works for men, but not for women. Syncing your cycle will not only fix your period problems, it will help you find more happiness, energy, and success in life. Simply put, tending to your 28-day cycle is as important as tending to your 24-hour circadian cycle.",aap ke cycle ke sath mutabqat pazeeri kya ahem hai ?,"jee haan! tamam bio hacks sirf aap ko haasil hon ge agar aap apne cycle ke mutabiq zindagi guzaarna shuru nahi karte hain. aap ke 28 din ke chakkar ke har hafta taweel marhalay ke liye khana aur werzish karna behtar mehsoos karne aur alamaat se pak mahvari ki bunyaad hai. bohat lambay arsay se, hum din raat isi terhan zindagi guzaar rahay hain. yeh mardon ke liye kaam karta hai, lekin aurton ke liye nahi. –apne cycle ko hum aahang karne se nah sirf aap ki mahvari ke masail hal hon ge, balkay is se aap ko zindagi mein mazeed khushi, tawanai aur kamyabi haasil karne mein madad miley gi. seedhay alfaaz mein, aap ke 28 din ke chakkar ka khayaal rakhna itna hi ahem hai jitna aap ke 24 ghantay ke carcadian cycle ka khayaal rakhna ."
 I know that PMS exists but I want to know what are some foods that are considered good to eat?,"Chickpeas a great source of magnesium. They also contain vitamin B6. 

Kale, broccoli, cauliflower, and other dark leafy greens. All of these contain indole-3 carbinol, which helps the liver metabolize excess estrogen and prevent estrogen dominance (which is a common hormone imbalance that gives rise to a bunch of period problems, including PMS).

Coconut yogurt contains probiotics in the form of live cultures (which helps the gut metabolize estrogen and keep hormones balanced)

Sweet potatoes are naturally sweet and can help satisfy your sweet cravings. The vitamin A in sweet potatoes supports the liver as it metabolizes excess estrogen.

Bone broth can be a good source of magnesium and calcium, both of which can help alleviate the symptoms of PMS. ",mein jaanti hon ke PMS mojood hai lekin mein janna chahti hon ke woh kon si ghazayein hain jinhein khana acha samjha jata hai ?,"chanay magnesium ka aik bara zareya hai. un mein vitamin B6 bhi hota hai .

And what if I want to prevent PMS but I don't want to use medicines. Are there any natural supplements?,"Yes there are. Research suggests that magnesium helps alleviate symptoms of PMS, including weight gain, breast tenderness, and bloating. Omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin D3 help promote hormone balance. Vitamin E helps reduce breast premenstrual breast tenderness, according to research. (So does vitamin B6!). Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) offers powerful antioxidant support for the liver as it works to metabolize excess estrogen — remember: too much estrogen relative to progesterone can trigger PMS symptoms — and also supports stable blood sugar. Calcium supplements have been shown to help with mood swings during the luteal phase.",aur agar mein pms ko rokna chahti hon lekin mein dawaein istemaal nahi karna chahti to kya ye mumkin hai? kya koi qudrati supplements hain ?,"jee haan. tehqeeq se pata chalta hai ke magnesium pms ki alamaat ko kam karne mein madad karta hai, Bashmole wazan mein izafah, chhaati ki narmi, aur aphara/bloating. omega 3 fatty acid aur vitamin d3 hormone ke tawazun ko farogh dainay mein madad karte hain. tehqeeq ke mutabiq vitamin E mahvari se pehlay chhaati ki narmi ko kam karne mein madad karta hai.
