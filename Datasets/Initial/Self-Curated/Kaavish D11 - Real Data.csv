If you address the underlying hormone imbalance with food and lifestyle, you can erase the symptoms of Pre Menstrual Syndrome. Experts also believe that nutrient deficiencies play a role in PMS symptoms. Research has shown a connection between low levels of vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium and PMS symptoms.
