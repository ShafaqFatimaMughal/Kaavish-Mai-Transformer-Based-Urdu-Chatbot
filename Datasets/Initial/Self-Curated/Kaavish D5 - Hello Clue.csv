Hello ,"Hello! My name is Mai, how can I help you today?",Hello ,"hello! mera naam maai hai, aaj mein aap ki madad kaisay kar sakti hon ?"
"I had some questions about my periods, will you be able to help me?","Sure, in fact you have reached the right person as I have quite a lot of information on menstrual health. What questions do you have for me?","mere mahvari ke baray mein kuch sawalaat thay, kya aap meri madad kar saken ge ?","yakeeni tor par, aap sahih shakhs tak pahonch gaye hain kyunkay mere paas mahvari ki sehat ke baray mein kaafi maloomat hain. aap ke paas mere liye kya sawalaat hain ?"
I wanted to know what an ovary is?,"The ovaries are small, oval-shaped glands located on either side of your uterus. They produce and store your eggs (also called ovum) and make hormones that control your menstrual cycle and pregnancy. During ovulation, one of your ovaries releases an egg. If a sperm fertilizes this egg, you can become pregnant. Your ovaries continue to release an egg each menstrual cycle until you reach menopause. I hope that answers your question",mein janna chahti thi ke beza daani/ovary kya hai ?,"beza daani/ovary chhootey, baizvi shakal ke ghudood hain jo aap ke reham ke dono taraf waqay hain. woh aap ke anday tayyar karte aur zakheera karte hain ( jisay beza bhi kaha jata hai ) aur hormones banatay hain jo aap ke mahvari aur hamal ko control karte hain. beza daani/ovary ke douran, aap ke beza daani/ovary mein se aik anda kharij karta hai. agar koi nutfa is anday ko khad deta hai to aap haamla ho sakti hain. aap ke beza daani/ovary har mahvari ke douran aik anda jari karti rehti hai jab tak ke aap rajunoorti/menopause tak nah pahonch jayen. mujhe umeed hai ke yeh aap ke sawal ka jawab day ga ."
"Oh, right. Thanks. I was also wondering what uterus looks like",The uterus is a hollow muscular organ located in the female pelvis between the bladder and rectum. The ovaries produce the eggs that travel through the fallopian tubes. Once the egg has left the ovary it can be fertilized and implant itself in the lining of the uterus.,"oh, theek hai? shukriya. mein yeh bhi soch rahi thi ke bacha daani/uterus kaisa lagta hai .",bacha daani/uterus aik khokhala azlaati uzoo hai jo khawateen ke sharooni mein masanay aur milaashi ke darmiyan waqay hota hai. beza daani/ovary anday peda karti hai jo fallopian tubes ke zariye safar karti hai. aik baar jab anda beza daani/ovary se nikal jata hai to usay frtilayz kya ja sakta hai aur khud ko bacha daani/uterus ki parat mein lagaya ja sakta hai .
What happens in a menstrual cycle ,"A menstrual cycle starts on the first day of the period and ends at the start of the next period. An entire menstrual cycle usually lasts between 24 and 38 days, but menstrual cycles can vary from person to person, cycle to cycle, and may also change over the years. Some people notice changes in their hair, skin, poop, chronic disease symptoms, mood, migraine headaches, or even in the way they experience sex at different points in the menstrual cycle. The cycle involves Uterine cycle and Ovarian Cycle. Do you understand what a uterine cycle is?",mahvari mein kya hota hai .,"mahvari mahvari ke pehlay din se shuru hoti hai aur agli mahvari ke aaghaz par khatam hoti hai. aik mukammal mahvari aam tor par 24 se 38 din ke darmiyan rehti hai, lekin mahvari ke chakkar 1 shakhs se dosray, cycle se mukhtalif ho satke hain, aur saloon ke douran tabdeel bhi ho satke hain. kuch log –apne balon, jald, pakhana, daimi bemari ki alamaat, mood, dard shaqeeqa ke sir dard, ya yahan tak ke mahvari ke douran mukhtalif maqamat par sex ka tajurbah karne ke andaaz mein tabdeelian mehsoos karte hain. cycle mein yotrn cycle aur avorin cycle shaamil hota hai. kya aap samajte hain ke uterine cycle kya hai ?"
I am not sure if I understood it.,"Okay so before Ovulation, this cycle physically changes the uterus. This is the stage where menstruation happens and it happens during the period – from the time vaginal bleeding starts to the time it ends. Blood from the previous cycle from inside the uterus is shed through the cervix and vagina. The uterine lining, called the endometrium, is thinnest during this phase. A typical period may last up to 8 days, but on average lasts about five or six.",mujhe ye baat shayad samajh nahi aayi hai ,"theek hai to ovulation se pehlay, yeh cycle jismani tor par bacha daani/uterus ko tabdeel karta hai. yeh woh marhala hai jahan haiz aata hai aur yeh muddat ke douran hota hai – jab se andaam nihani/vagina se khoon behna shuru hota hai is ke khatam honay tak. bacha daani/uterus ke andar se pichlle chakkar se khoon grewah aur andaam nihani/vagina ke zariye bahaya jata hai. bacha daani/uterus ki parat, jisay endometrium kaha jata hai, is marhalay ke douran sab se patla hota hai. aik aam muddat 8 din tak chal sakti hai, lekin ausatan taqreeban paanch ya chay rehti hai "
Thank you for answering my questions,"No problem, do you have any more questions for me?",mere sawalaat ke jawab dainay ke liye aap ka shukriya,"koi masla nahi, kya aap ke paas mere liye koi aur sawal hai ?"
"No, bye","Take care, bye","nahi, alwida","apna khayal rakhe, alwida"
Can you tell if hormones play a role in the menstrual cycle?,"Sure! There are hormones that are involved and those are estrogen and progesterone. Levels of estrogen and progesterone are typically at their lowest. This causes the top layers of the lining to release and leave the body. After ovulation, this involves the Secretory Phase, that occurs from ovulation until the start of the next period. The uterine lining gets ready to support a pregnancy or to break down for menstruation. In this stage, progesterone rises. This causes the uterine lining to stop thickening and prepare for a fertilized egg. These hormones rise after ovulation and are highest during a period. Blood vessels shrink and the uterine lining breaks down. The uterine cells produce less of these chemicals if pregnancy happens.",kya aap bta satke hain ke kya hormones mahvari mein koi kirdaar ada karte hain ?,"zaroor! is mein shaamil hormones hain aur woh hain estrogen aur progesterone. Estrogen aur progesterone ki satah aam tor par sab se kam hoti hai. is ki wajah se aster/lining ki oopri tahein jism se bahar nikal jati hain. beza daani/ovary ke baad, is mein secretary Fez shaamil hota hai, jo beza daani/ovary se agli muddat ke aaghaz tak hota hai. bacha daani/uterus ki parat hamal ko sahara dainay ya mahvari ke liye totnay ke liye tayyar ho jati hai. is marhalay mein progesterone barh jata hai. is ki wajah se bacha daani/uterus ki parat gaarha hona band ho jati hai aur fertilized anday ki tayari karti hai. yeh hormone beza daani/ovary ke baad barhatay hain aur muddat ke douran sab se ziyada hotay hain. khoon ki naalian suker jati hain aur bacha daani/uterus ki parat toot jati hai. agar hamal hota hai to bacha daani/uterus ke khaliye un mein se kam chemical peda karte hain ."
Is the ovarian cycle also part of the menstrual cycle? ,"Yes it is! Before ovulation, the ovarian cycle physically changes the ovaries. Would you like to know what are stages of ovarian cycle?",kya reham ka chakkar bhi mahvari ka hissa hai ?,haan yeh hai! beza daani/ovary se pehlay dambagranti cycle jismani tor par beza daani/ovary ko tabdeel karta hai. kya aap janna chahain ge ke dambagranti cycle ke marahil kya hain ?
Yes I want to know the stages in the ovarian cycle,"The first stage is the follicular phase. It starts from the start of the period until ovulation.Throughout the menstrual cycle, there are multiple follicles (fluid filled sacs containing eggs) at different stages of development in both ovaries. The period ends about halfway through this phase. One follicle in one of the ovaries becomes the largest of all the follicles, called the dominant follicle and is the size of a grain of sand (1-2 cm). This follicle is the one prepared to be released at ovulation. For most people, the follicular phase lasts 10-22 days, but this can vary from cycle-to-cycle.

",haan mein beza daani/ovary ke chakkar ke marahil janna chahti hon .,"pehla marhala follicular marhala hai. yeh muddat ke aaghaz se beza daani/ovary tak shuru hota hai. mahvari ke poooray daur mein, dono beza daani/ovary mein nashonuma ke mukhtalif marahil mein aik se ziyada follicles ( anday par mushtamil seyal/fluid bharay thelay ) hotay hain. muddat is marhalay mein taqreeban nisf khatam ho jati hai. beza daani/ovary mein se aik mein aik patak tamam follicles mein sab se bara ban jata hai, jisay ghalib follicle kehte hain aur rait ke aik danay ( 1-2 centi meter ) ke size ka hota hai. yeh follicle woh hai jo ovulation ke waqt jari honay ke liye tayyar hota hai. ziyada tar logon ke liye, patak ka marhala 10-22 din tak rehta hai, lekin yeh cycle se cycle se mukhtalif ho sakta hai ."
What hormones are active in this follicular phase?,"The hormone active here is the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH tells the ovaries to prepare an egg for ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary). The dominant follicle produces estrogen as it grows, which peaks just before ovulation happens.",is follicular marhalay mein kon se hormones fa-aal hain ?,"yahan fa-aal hormone follicle stimulating hormone ( fsh ) hai. f s each beza daani/ovary se kehta hai ke beza daani/ovary ke liye aik anda tayyar karen ( beza daani/ovary se anday ka ikhraj ). ghalib follicle barhatay hi estrogen peda karta hai, jo beza ban'nay se ain pehlay urooj par pahonch jata hai ."
What happens after ovulation?,"After ovulation, this cycle is Luteal Phase. It occurs from ovulation until the start of the next period and lasts about 14 days, but between 9 and 16 days is common. After ovulation, the follicle that held the egg turns into something called a corpus luteum. It makes the hormones progesterone and estrogen to support pregnancy. If pregnancy does not happen, the corpus luteum breaks down between 9 and 11 days after ovulation. Else, progesterone supports early pregnancy if an egg and sperm connect. If no pregnancy happens, progesterone will peak and then drop. These hormonal changes can contribute to common premenstrual symptoms such as mood changes, headaches, acne, bloating, and breast tenderness. A drop in progesterone and estrogen causes menstruation.",ovulation ke baad kya hota hai,"ovulation ke baad, yeh cycle luteal marhala hai. yeh ovulation se agli muddat ke aaghaz tak hota hai aur taqreeban 14 din rehta hai, lekin 9 se 16 din ke darmiyan aam hai. beza daani/ovary ke baad, anday ko pakarney wala patak aik aisi cheez mein badal jata hai jisay corpus luteum kehte hain. yeh hormones progesterone aur estrogen ko hamal ko sahara dainay ke liye banata hai. agar hamal nahi hota hai to, corpus luteum ovulation ke 9 se 11 dinon ke darmiyan toot jata hai. basorat deegar, progesterone ibtidayi hamal ki himayat karta hai agar anda aur supreme aapas mein jurey hon. agar hamal nahi hota hai to, progesterone chouti aur phir gir jaye ga. yeh hormonal tabdeelian mahvari se pehlay ki aam alamaat jaisay mood mein tabdeeli, sir dard, mahasay, aphara, aur chhaati ki narmi mein hissa daal sakti hain. progesterone aur estrogen mein kami mahvari ka sabab banti hai ."
Can I ask you general questions regarding periods?,Yes! Don't hesisate at all because that is what I am here for. ,kya mein aap se mahvari se mutaliq umomi sawalaat pooch sakti hon ?,jee haan! bilkul hichkichahat mat karo kyunkay mein isi ke liye yahan hon .
Why can my period change?,"Periods fluctuate when they first start. If you’ve had your period for a few years, it should generally be about the same length and volume each cycle. You may still notice changes from time to time, such as the heaviness and length of your period which can fluctuate, depending on your hormones. Hormones can change temporarily because of things like stress, diet, or taking an emergency contraception pill.  Your period will also have variations if you don’t ovulate each cycle—you may miss a period, or come later than usual, and/or be heavier/lighter and shorter/longer than your usual. Not ovulating during each cycle is common during adolescence and perimenopause, and is a common cause of temporarily absent and/or heavy menstrual periods.",meri mahwaari kyun badal sakti hai ?,"mahvari mein utaar charhao aata hai jab woh pehli baar shuru hotay hain. agar aap ki mahvari kuch saloon se guzar rahi hai, to yeh aam tor par har aik cycle ki lambai aur hajam ke barabar hona chahiye. aap ab bhi waqtan foqatan tabdeelian mehsoos kar satke hain, jaisay aap ke hormones ke lehaaz se aap ki muddat ka wazan aur Tawalat jo utaar charhao ka shikaar ho sakti hai. tanao, khoraak, ya hungami Maney hamal goli /contraceptive pilllainay jaisi cheezon ki wajah se hormones earzi tor par tabdeel ho satke hain. agar aap har daur mein beza nahi karte hain to aap ki muddat mein bhi tagayuraat hon ge — aap ko aik period chhuut sakta hai, ya mamool se baad mein aata hai, aur / ya aap ke mamool se ziyada bhaari / halka aur chhota / lamba ho sakta hai. har chakkar ke douran beza nah hona jawani aur peeri menopause ke douran aam hai, aur yeh earzi tor par ghair haazir aur / ya mahvari ke bhaari honay ki aik aam wajah hai ."

"Hello, I have some questions","Hello! My name is Mai, how can I help you today?","Hello, mere kuch sawalaat hai","hello! mera naam maai hai, aaj mein aap ki madad kaisay kar sakti hon ?"
Can periods fluctuate because of health conditions?,"Yes, periods can also fluctuate because of certain health conditions, like uterine polyps, fibroids, or PCOS—conditions that should be addressed with your healthcare provider. Certain bleeding conditions and medications can also affect menstrual bleeding.",kya sehat ke halaat ki wajah se mahvari mein utaar charhao aa sakta hai ?,"haan, baaz sehat ki halaton ki wajah se bhi mahvari mein utaar charhao aa sakta hai, jaisay uterine polyps, fertilized, ya pcos — aisi halatain jin par aap ke health care provider ya doctor se tawajah di jani chahiye. khoon behnay ke baaz halaat aur adwiyaat bhi mahvari ke khoon ko mutasir kar sakti hain ."
Do you suggest if I should track my period or not,"Tracking your period can help you understand the patterns of symptoms that you experience throughout your menstrual cycle—from pain, to cravings, to sex drive. Tracking can give you a better idea of when you are fertile, which may be helpful if you’re trying to become pregnant.",kya aap tajweez karte hain ke mujhe apni muddat ko track karna chahiye ya nahi ?,"apni mahvari ka suraagh laganay se aap ko un alamaat ke namonon ko samajhney mein madad mil sakti hai jo aap –apne mahvari ke douran mehsoos karte hain — dard se le kar khwahisaat tak, jinsi khwahish tak. tracking aap ko behtar andaza day sakti hai ke aap kab zarkhaiz hain, jo madadgaar saabit ho sakta hai agar aap haamla honay ki koshish kar rahay hain ."
What are irregular cycle lengths,"For adolescents, the cycles outside the range of 21–45 days and for adults, cycles outside the range of 24–38 day or cycles that vary in length by more than 7–9 days (for example, a cycle that is 27 days long one month, 42 the next). If periods that suddenly stop for more than 90 days (exceptions include pregnancy, menopause, and recently discontinued hormonal birth control), this counts as irregular cycle length too. Do you want to know why ",fasid cycle ki lambai kya hain ?,"nau umaron ke liye, 21–45 din ki had se bahar aur balighon ke liye, 24–38 din ki had se bahar ke cycle ya aisay cycle jin ki lambai 7–9 din se ziyada hoti hai ( misaal ke tor par, aik cycle jo 27 din ka hota hai. aik maheena, 42 agla ). agar mahvari achanak 90 dinon se ziyada ruk jati hai ( istasna mein hamal, rajonooti, aur haal hi mein band hormonal birth control shaamil hain ), is ka shumaar bhi cycle ki be qaidgi ke tor par kya jata hai. kya aap janna chahtay hain kyun ?"

Why do irregular periods matter,"Cycles that are continually irregular can have a serious impact on short- and long-term health. They can lead to a wide range of more serious health conditions, and cause distressing symptoms. Menstrual cycle health is related to your heart health, metabolism, sleep, fertility, and more. This is why it's important to have any potential issues diagnosed as early as possible, and managed with the help of a healthcare provider.",be qaida mahvari kyun ahmiyat rakhti hai .,"cycle jo musalsal be qaida hotay hain mukhtasir aur taweel mudti sehat par sangeen assar daal satke hain. woh sehat ki ziyada sangeen halaton ki aik wasee range ka baais ban satke hain, aur pareshan kin alamaat ka sabab ban satke hain. mahvari ki sehat ka talluq aap ke dil ki sehat, metabolism, neend, zarkhaizi aur bohat kuch se hai. is liye yeh zaroori hai ke kisi bhi mumkina masail ki jald az jald tashkhees ki jaye, aur sehat ki dekh bhaal faraham karne walay ki madad se un ka intizam kya jaye ."

"yes, I am worried my period is late","A lot of people feel concerned when their periods don’t show up on time, so I understand why you might be worried. However, there’s no need to worry just yet. There could be a number of reasons as to why your period might be late. These could include:

Stress
Travel
Diet
Illness
Medication
Birth control
Keeping track of changes to your lifestyle and environment can help you pinpoint why you might be experiencing variations in your menstrual cycle. Doing this daily can help you become more aware of what’s happening and let you know if there’s anything you should bring up with your healthcare provider.","haan, mujhe fikar hai ke meri mahvari der se hai .","bohat se log fikar mand hotay hain jab un ke mahvari waqt par zahir nahi hoti hai, lehaza mein samjhta hon ke aap kyun pareshan ho satke hain. taham, abhi tak fikar karne ki zaroorat nahi hai. aap ki mahvari mein der kyun ho sakti hai is ki kayi wajohaat ho sakti hain. un mein shaamil ho sakta hai :

"What about vaginal discharge, what is that?","Vaginal discharge is any non-period fluid that leaves your vagina. It is mostly water. There are also tiny microorganisms, including bacteria, present. This discharge helps the body remove old cells from the vagina and protects vaginal tissues from infection. Vaginal discharge changes in the way it looks and feels throughout the cycle.

Discharge can include vaginal lubrication, arousal fluid, semen after having sex, and cervical fluid, or possibly discharge from bacterial growth or an infection. 

You may notice more or less vaginal discharge throughout your cycle and during different stages of your life, such as after giving birth or during menopause.  ","andaam nihani/vagina kharij honay walay madah/fluid ke baray mein kya hai, yeh kya hai ?","andaam nihani/vagina se kharij honay wala madah/fluid koi bhi ghair mudti seyal/fluid hai jo aap ki andaam nihani/vagina se nikalta hai. yeh ziyada tar pani hai. bacteria samait chhootey chhootey microorganisms bhi mojood hain. yeh madah/fluid jism ko andaam nihani/vagina se puranay khalion ko nikaalte mein madad karta hai aur andaam nihani/vagina ke tissues ko infection se bachata hai. andaam nihani/vagina se kharij honay wala madah/fluid poooray chakkar ke douran is ke dikhne aur mehsoos karne ke andaaz mein badal jata hai .

"You mentioned cervical fluid, this is the first time I read it. What is that","Cervical fluid is produced by the cells of your cervix. The cervix is the opening to the uterus from the vagina. Cervical fluid can change throughout your cycle from thick, creamy, and sticky to thin, wet, and slippery. 

When the hormone estrogen increases right before ovulation, cervical fluid thins. This makes it easier for sperm to move through the cervix. This thinning may make it look like there is an increase in discharge and it may seem stretchier. When the hormone progesterone increases, cervical mucus thickens.","aap ne cervical fluid ka zikar kya, yeh mein ne pehli baar parha. woh kya hai","garewa seyal/fluid aap ke garewa ke khaliyaat ke zareya tayyar kya jata hai. garewa andaam nihani/vagina se bacha daani/uterus ka khilna hai. garewa seyal/fluid aap ke poooray daur mein mouti, kareemi, aur chip chapa se patli, geelay aur phislan mein tabdeel ho sakta hai .

I would also like to know what is arousal fluid,"Lubrication fluid is filtered from blood plasma (the liquid part of blood minus the blood cells) (Pastor). Sexual arousal (excitement) causes extra blood to flow to the tissue of the vagina. There is more pressure in the swollen tissue and this causes the fluid to be pushed to the surface of the vaginal walls. This increase in moisture, or “wetness”, is vaginal lubrication or arousal fluid.",mein yeh bhi janna chahoon gi ke arousal seyal/fluid kya hai ?,"chikna seyal/fluid khoon ke plasma ( khoon ka maya hissa minus khoon ke khaliyaat ) ( paadri ) se flutter kya jata hai. jinsi josh ( josh ) andaam nihani/vagina ke bafton mein izafi khoon behnay ka sabab bantaa hai. sooji hui bafton mein ziyada dabao hota hai aur is ki wajah se seyal/fluid andaam nihani/vagina ki dewaron ki satah par dhkilta hai. nami mein yeh izafah, ya"" geela pan "", andaam nihani/vagina ki chikna ya hosla afzai ka seyal/fluid hai ."
"I am confused, are female ejaculation and squirting the same thing?","No, they’re not. Female ejaculate is the release of a few milliliters of thick white fluid that is released from the urethra. It is not urine. Some people with vulvas report ejaculation happening before or after and with or without orgasm.

Squirting is the release of clear fluid from the urethra, usually during orgasm or high arousal. The fluid in squirting is similar to urine and comes from the bladder. Both can happen at the same time. Not everyone will experience them and that’s normal too.","mein uljan mein hon, kya khawateen ka inzaal/ejaculate aur squirting aik hi cheez hai ?","nahi, woh nahi hain. zanana inzaal/ejaculate chand mili letter motay safaid seyal/fluid ka ikhraj hai jo pishaab ki naali se kharij hota hai. yeh pishaab nahi hai. vulvas ke sath kuch log orgasm se pehlay ya baad mein aur orgasm ke sath ya is ke baghair honay ki ittila dete hain .
 
 squirting pishaab ki naali se saaf seyal/fluid ka ikhraj hai, aam tor par orgasm ya ziyada josh ke douran. squirting mein seyal/fluid pishaab ki terhan hai aur masanay se aata hai. dono aik hi waqt mein ho satke hain. har koi un ka tajurbah nahi kere ga aur yeh mamool bhi hai ."
I have questions,"Hello, sure. How can I help?",mere paas sawalaat hain .,"hello, zaroor. mein kis terhan madad kar sakta hon ?"
Does sex affect vaginal discharge?,"Before, during, and after sex, you may notice your vagina feels wetter. This can be due to arousal fluid, lube, or if you had penis-in-vagina sex without a condom, semen. You may notice semen coming out of the vagina right after sex or during the hours following sex. Semen is usually a gray-white, cloudy, jelly-like liquid. Spotting after sex could happen because of dryness or irritation, but it could also be caused by your cervix being swollen from an infection.",kya jinsi andaam nihani/vagina ke kharij honay walay madah/fluid ko mutasir karta hai ?,"jinsi taluqaat se pehlay, douran aur baad mein, aap dekh satke hain ke aap ki andaam nihani/vagina giili mehsoos hoti hai. yeh hosla afzai ke seyal/fluid, chiknai, ya agar aap ne kndom, money ke baghair uzoo tanasul mein andaam nihani/vagina jinsi taluqaat ki wajah se ho sakta hai. aap sex ke foran baad ya sex ke baad ke ghanton ke douran andaam nihani/vagina se money nikaltay dekh satke hain. money aam tor par aik surmai safaid, abr alood, jelly jaisa maya hota hai. jinsi taluqaat ke baad dhabbay khushki ya jalan ki wajah se ho satke hain, lekin yeh infection se aap ke garewa ke soojan ki wajah se bhi ho sakta hai ."
My doctor suggested birth controls. Will they affect vaginal discharge?,"Hormonal birth control can affect vaginal discharge. Birth control that contains progestin (a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone) can make cervical fluid thicker, which makes it harder for sperm to get through the cervix. If you are having this kind of birth control, then you may see thicker or less vaginal discharge because of this",mere dr ne paidaiesh par qaboo panay ka mahswara diya. kya woh andaam nihani/vagina se kharij honay walay madah/fluid ko mutasir karen ge ?,"hormonal birth control andaam nihani/vagina se kharij honay walay madah/fluid ko mutasir kar sakta hai. birth control jis mein progestin hota hai ( hormone progestrone ka aik masnoi version ) garewa ke ratobat ko gaarha bana sakta hai, jis ki wajah se supreme ke liye garewa ke zariye jana mushkil ho jata hai. agar aap is qisam ka birth control kar rahay hain, to aap ko is ki wajah se andaam nihani/vagina se ziyada gaarha ya kam ikhraj nazar aa sakta hai ."
Do pregnancy and breastfeeding affect vaginal discharge?,"Changing levels of the hormone estrogen during pregnancy, postpartum (after birth), and breastfeeding can cause vaginal dryness for some people. But worry not, using a lubricant can help make sex more pleasurable or comfortable if vaginal dryness is bothersome.

How does that happen,"During your periods, it will be in the form of bleeding (menstruation). On day one of the cycle, the first day of your period, levels of both estrogen and progesterone are low. The cervix is not producing much fluid at this time, but this won’t be noticed much since there is period bleeding.",aisa kaisay hota hai .,"aap ki mahvari ke douran, yeh khoon behnay ( haiz ) ki soorat mein hoga. cycle ke pehlay din, aap ki mahvari ke pehlay din, estrogen aur progestronee dono ki satah kam hoti hai. garewa is waqt ziyada seyal/fluid peda nahi kar raha hai, lekin is par ziyada tawajah nahi di jaye gi kyunkay douran khoon beh raha hai ."
What about vaginal discharge once periods end,"Just after a periods, the discharge is absent and dry. Estrogen is produced by a small sac in the ovary holding an egg, called a follicle. Estrogen slowly increases after the period ends. There may be less cervical fluid for a couple of days after your period ends until estrogen increases again. In fact, it also changes after periods and before ovulation.",mahvari khatam honay ke baad andaam nihani/vagina se kharij honay walay madah/fluid ka kya hoga ?,"sirf aik muddat ke baad, madah/fluid gayab aur khushk hai. estrogen beza daani/ovary mein aik choti si theli se peda hota hai jis mein anday hotay hain, jisay follicle kehte hain. muddat khatam honay ke baad estrogen aahista aahista barhta hai. aap ki mahvari khatam honay ke baad chand dinon tak cervical fluid kam ho sakta hai jab tak ke estrogen dobarah nah barh jaye. dar haqeeqat, yeh mahvari ke baad aur beza daani/ovary se pehlay bhi badal jata hai ."
How,"The days between your period and ovulation, this discharge will become sticky, white and creamy. Estrogen levels are rising quickly now and the cervix produces more fluid. At first, discharge may look thick and sticky. Then it may become more wet and creamy, like a lotion. Discharge during this time can look whitish and cloudy, or even yellowish (especially if it’s dry on your underwear). In a 28-day menstrual cycle, you may first notice this fluid around day nine or ten. This is just an estimate. People have different cycle lengths and ovulation can vary from cycle to cycle, even in people who feel their cycles are predictable",kaisay,"aap ki mahvari aur beza daani/ovary ke darmiyan ke dinon mein yeh madah/fluid chip chapa, safaid aur kareemi ho jaye ga. estrogen ki satah ab taizi se barh rahi hai aur garewa ziyada seyal/fluid peda karta hai. sab se pehlay, madah/fluid mota aur chip chapa lag sakta hai. phir yeh aik lotion ki terhan ziyada geela aur kareemi ho sakta hai. is waqt ke douran kharij honay wala madah/fluid safaid aur abr alood, ya yahan tak ke zard nazar aasakta hai ( khaas tor par agar yeh aap ke zair jama par khushk ho ). 28 din ke mahvari ke chakkar mein, aap sab se pehlay din no ya das ke ird gird is seyal/fluid ko mehsoos kar satke hain. yeh sirf aik andaza hai. logon ki cycle ki lambai mukhtalif hoti hai aur ovulation aik cycle se mukhtalif ho sakta hai, yahan tak ke un logon mein bhi jo mehsoos karte hain ke un ke chakron ka andaza lagaya ja sakta hai ."
How will it look like near and during ovulation?," A few days before and during ovulation, it will be clear, wet, slippery, and stretchy. There is a lot of cervical fluid during the days right before ovulation. Your vagina will likely start to feel much wetter. There is more cervical fluid during this time and this is typically very slippery. This is caused by estrogen peaking one to two days before ovulation. Discharge may look like raw egg whites that can be stretched for inches between your thumb and finger",ovulation ke qareeb aur douran yeh kaisa nazar aaye ga ?,"beza daani/ovary se kuch din pehlay aur is ke douran, yeh saaf, geela, phisalna aur khainchta sun-hwa hoga. beza daani/ovary se pehlay ke dinon mein cervical fluid bohat ziyada hota hai. aap ki andaam nihani/vagina bohat ziyada giili mehsoos karne lagey gi. is douran cervical seyal/fluid ziyada hota hai aur yeh aam tor par bohat phisalta hai. yeh ovulation se aik se do din pehlay estrogen ki chouti ki wajah se hota hai. kharij honay wala madah/fluid kachay anday ki safedi ki terhan nazar aata hai jisay aap ke angothay aur ungli ke darmiyan inch tak phelaya ja sakta hai ."
What does it look like when ovulation is over and periods are yet to come,"After ovulation until the start of the next period bleeding, the discharge is sticky and dry. As soon as ovulation is over, vaginal discharge decreases. The hormone progesterone is higher and this decreases the release of fluid from the cervix and discharge may become tacky, dry, or absent ",jab beza khatam ho gaya ho aur mahvari aana baqi ho to yeh kaisa lagta hai ?,"ovulation ke baad agli muddat ke khoon ke aaghaz tak, kharij honay wala madah/fluid chip chapa aur khushk hota hai. jaisay hi beza khatam hota hai, andaam nihani/vagina se kharij honay wala madah/fluid kam hojata hai. hormone progestrone ziyada hota hai aur is se garewa se seyal/fluid ke ikhraj mein kami aati hai aur kharij honay wala madah/fluid mushkil, khushk ya ghair haazir ho sakta hai ."

"Yes, what is BV?","It’s common not to have heard about bacterial vaginosis (BV) until you notice an issue with your own fluid. BV happens when the normal balance of vaginal bacteria is replaced by high numbers of anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that don’t need oxygen to grow). The most common type of BV-causing bacteria is called Gardnerella. The digestion processes of the new bacterial community create different byproducts and environmental changes, which can lead to symptoms from a fishy or unpleasant odor to itching, discomfort and inflammation. An immune response is also triggered in the vagina and can degrade the vagina’s naturally protective mucus. This can make the reproductive tract more prone to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like HIV and chlamydia. 

","jee haan, bv kya hai ?","yeh aam baat hai ke bacterial viogosis ( bv ) ke baray mein is waqt tak nahi suna hai jab tak ke aap ko –apne seyal/fluid ke sath koi masla mehsoos nah ho. bv is waqt hota hai jab andaam nihani/vagina ke bacteria ke mamool ke tawazun ko ziyada tadaad mein anorbik bacteria ( bacteria jin ko bherne ke liye oxygen ki zaroorat nahi hoti ) se badal diya jata hai. bv peda karne walay bacteria ki sab se aam qisam ko gardnerella kaha jata hai. naye bacterial community ke amal inhizam ke amal mukhtalif zimni masnoaat aur maholiyati tabdeelian peda karte hain, jo machhli ya nakhushgawaar badboo se le kar kharish, takleef aur soozish tak alamaat ka baais ban satke hain. andaam nihani/vagina mein mdafati rad-e-amal bhi shuru hota hai aur andaam nihani/vagina ke qudrati tor par hifazati balgham ko kharab kar sakta hai. yeh toleedi rastay ko jinsi tor par muntaqil honay walay infection ( stis ) jaisay hiv aur chlamydia ka ziyada khatrah bana sakta hai ."
Are there any impacts of bacterial vaginosis other than on your body?,"In many cases, the most significant impacts of symptomatic BV are emotional and social. This is especially true for people whose BV is recurrent (having it multiple times, despite treatment). One study found that, depending on the severity and frequency of symptoms, BV can lead people to feel “…embarrassed, ashamed, “dirty” and ""very concerned"" others may detect their malodor and abnormal discharge”. It can affect a person’s self-esteem and sex life, and they may avoid sexual activity (especially receptive oral sex) altogether. Recurrent symptoms, without an understanding of the reason, can be frustrating and make someone feel out of control.",kya aap ke jism ke ilawa bacterial vaginosis ke koi asraat hain ?,"bohat se mamlaat mein, allamti bv ke sab se ahem asraat jazbati aur samaji hotay hain. yeh khaas tor par un logon ke liye durust hai jin ka bv baar baar hota hai ( ilaaj ke bawajood usay kayi baar hona ). aik tehqeeq se pata chala hai ke alamaat ki shiddat aur tadad par munhasir hai, bv logon ko "". .. sharminda, sharminda,"" gandi"" aur"" bohat fikar mand"" mehsoos kar sakta hai doosron ko un ki kharabi aur ghair mamooli madah/fluid ka pata lag sakta hai. yeh kisi shakhs ki khud itmadi aur jinsi zindagi ko mutasir kar sakta hai, aur woh jinsi sargarmi ( khaas tor par qubool karne wali zabani jinsi ) se yaksar guraiz kar satke hain. baar baar honay wali alamaat, wajah ko samjhay baghair, mayoos kin hosakti hain aur kisi ko qaboo se bahar honay ka ehsas dilaati hain ."

How common is this?,"Bacterial vaginosis is commonly seen in women of reproductive age, although the disease is not limited to any age. The prevalence of BV varies widely amongst demographics, and is tied to sociodemographic characteristics including race, ethnicity, education and income",yeh kitna aam hai ?,"bacterial viogosis aam tor par toleedi Umar ki khawateen mein dekha jata hai, halaank yeh bemari kisi bhi Umar tak mehdood nahi hai. bv ka phelao abadi ke lehaaz se wasee pemanay par mukhtalif hota hai, aur yeh nasal, nasal, taleem aur aamdani samait samaji aabadyati khususiyaat se munsalik hai ."
What are the causes for bacterial vaginosis,"Vaginal homeostasis can be disrupted by both internal factors (ex. antibiotics, diet) and external factors (ex. soap, semen), but it isn’t fully understood why one person gets recurrent BV in a particular situation when another doesn’t. Prolonged or irregular uterine bleeding may also be a contributor. This may happen because uterine blood changes the pH of the vagina to be slightly less acidic. Recurrent BV may pop up around the time of menstruation for the same reason. The use of hormonal contraceptives in general, including “the pill”, has been shown to have a protective effect against BV.",bacterial vaginosis ki wajohaat kya hain ?,"andaam nihani/vagina homeostatus ko androoni awamil ( maslan anti biotics, khoraak ) aur bairooni awamil ( misaal ke tor par sabun, money ) dono se mutasir kya ja sakta hai, lekin yeh poori terhan se samajh mein nahi aata hai ke 1 shakhs ko kisi khaas soorat e haal mein baar baar bv kyun hota hai jab dosray ko aisa nahi hota hai. bacha daani/uterus ka taweel ya be qaida khoon behna bhi aik Muawin ho sakta hai. aisa is liye ho sakta hai kyunkay bacha daani/uterus ka khoon andaam nihani/vagina ke pi each ko qadray kam tezabiyat mein badal deta hai. baar baar bv isi wajah se mahvari ke waqt ke aas paas paap up ho sakta hai. aam tor par hormonal Maney hamal adwiyaat ka istemaal, Bashmole "" goli "", bv ke khilaaf hifazati assar dekhata hai ."
"Oh, so is it true that sexual activity has a link to bacterial vaginosis?","Sexual activity is also associated with a higher risk of BV. Specific risk factors may include new or multiple sex partners, a lack of condom use, vaginal intercourse and receiving anal sex before vaginal intercourse without a new protective barrier","oh, to kya yeh sach hai ke jinsi sargarmi ka bacterial vaginosis se koi talluq hai ?","jinsi sargarmi bv ke ziyada khatray se bhi wabasta hai. makhsoos khatray ke awamil mein naye ya aik se ziyada jinsi shiraakat daar, kndom ke istemaal ki kami, andaam nihani/vagina se jamaa karna aur baghair kisi hifazati rukawat ke andaam nihani/vagina se hambistari se pehlay maq-ad se jinsi talluq haasil karna shaamil ho satke hain ."
How to prevent bacterial vaginosis,"Vaginal bacteria can sometimes get out of balance and then improve on its own. To prevent BV, start by limiting your risk factors. Use condoms, don’t douche and keep all soap away from your vulva and vagina (some experts say non-foaming unscented soap is okay on the vulva, and others say stick to water). Don’t use any products with scents or perfumes in that area, and limit your bubble baths.

Often though, symptoms will persist or recur and need to be treated. Finding the source of the issue would be most helpful, but this is often difficult when so little is known about the causes of BV.",bacterial vaginosis ko kaisay roka jaye .,"andaam nihani/vagina ke bacteria baaz auqaat tawazun se bahar ho jatay hain aur phir khud hi behtar ho jatay hain. bv ko roknay ke liye, –apne khatray ke awamil ko mehdood karkay shuru karen. kndom istemaal karen, dotch nah karen aur tamam sabun ko apni volva aur andaam nihani/vagina se daur rakhen ( kuch mahireen kehte hain ke jhaag nah anay wala ghair khushbu wala sabun wolve par theek hai, aur dosray kehte hain ke pani se chipak jayen ). is ilaqay mein khushbu ya prfume wali koi bhi masnoaat istemaal nah karen aur –apne bulbala hamaam ko mehdood karen .

How to treat bacterial vaginosis,"Treatment of BV can range from antibiotics and antiseptics, to medications to restore acidity, to probiotics. Some treatments are available over the counter, but others will need a prescription. Tracking your symptoms, especially when they begin may help you and your healthcare provider identify triggers.

Unfortunately, it’s common for BV to return after treatment. The lack of understanding of what causes BV means treatments still have a long way to go to be effective in the long term. The FDA estimates the post-treatment “cure rate is under 4 in 10, with between 3 and 8 people having recurrence within several months. Limiting risk factors after treatment can help—talk to your healthcare provider about options.

Why is my sexual desire fluctuating?,"Your sexual desire is influenced by some of the same hormones that fluctuate with your cycle, like estrogen and progesterone. You may find your desire tends to increase in the days leading up to ovulation and decrease after ovulation is over. Sex drive may be lower when more progesterone is produced during the luteal phase (the days after ovulation and leading up to menstruation). Exactly how reproductive hormones influence desire and preference isn’t the same for everyone; some people report a higher sex drive as part of their premenstrual experience, while other present with decreased libido.

If what your sexual partner is doing doesn’t work for you: you could try discussing your sexual likes and dislikes.

How does my breasts change before my first period,"Changes to your nipples and breasts may be the first thing you notice. In the beginning, the small bumps around your nipples become raised. Then, the darker area of your nipples will get bigger and start to puff out. These are called breast buds. This can happen on both sides at the same time, or on just one side at first. If it happens on one side, it can take up to 6 months for the other side to catch up. 

Most people first get their first period 2–3 years after their breast begin to grow. If your breast buds develop later than most people in your class, like when you’re 13, it may take less than a year for your period to start.  ",meri pehli mahvari se pehlay mere chhaati kaisay bdalty hain .,"aap ke nipples aur chatiyon mein tabdeeli pehli cheez ho sakti hai jisay aap mehsoos karte hain. shuru mein, aap ke nipples ke ird gird chhootey takra ubhray hue hain. is ke baad, aap ke nipples ka gehra hissa bara ho jaye ga aur phoolna shuru ho jaye ga. un ko breast bdz kehte hain. yeh aik hi waqt mein dono taraf ho sakta hai, ya pehlay sirf aik taraf. agar yeh aik taraf hota hai, to doosri taraf ko pakarney mein 6 mahinay lag satke hain .

How does my pubic hair change before my first period,"After breast buds, you may notice the first signs of pubic hair. Just a few long hairs may sprout up at first. You’ll grow more pubic hair with time, and that hair will get curlier, thicker, and spread out towards you thighs. 

There is a chance you’ll see some pubic hair before your breasts start to grow, but most people see it the other way around.

You probably won’t see any hair under your arms until around the time your period begins, or just before that

How does my hair change during periods ,"Many of the changes you may be associating with your hair throughout your cycle are due to the changes in oil production from your sebaceous glands. Since sebum (oil produced by the sebaceous gland) and the hair follicle exit from the same opening in the skin, the hair and skin surrounding may be coated in sebum. One study had an interesting finding: even if more bad hair days were registered around the time of menstruation, they did not correlate with increases in scalp sebum levels. There was not a clear explanation for the bad hair days—perhaps it’s due to a difference in participants’ personal perception of their hair. Is the change on your head or in your head?

"Oh, that is interesting. Can hormones also affect hair changes?","Some hormonal contraceptive medications (like chlormadinone acetate, a synthetic progesterone which provides anti-androgen activity) may also affect hair and skin quality. In one study of people taking these medications, participants had decreased sebum production and improved perceived hair quality. Sebum production is influenced by your hormones, particularly androgens (like testosterone). Sebum production often ramps up greatly during puberty, often being produced at high amounts between the ages of 15 to 35, as assessed on the skin. Estrogen also influences sebum production, especially at high doses. 
","oh, yeh dilchasp hai. kya hormones balon ki tabdeelion ko bhi mutasir kar satke hain ?","kuch hormonal Maney hamal adwiyaat ( jaisay chlormadinone acetate, aik masnoi progestrone jo anti endrogen sargarmi faraham karti hai ) balon aur jald ke miyaar ko bhi mutasir kar sakti hain. yeh adwiyaat lainay walay logon ke aik mutalea mein, shurka ne sebum ki pedawar mein kami ki thi aur balon ke miyaar ko behtar banaya tha. sebum ki pedawar aap ke hormones, khaas tor par endrogen ( jaisay tistostiron ) se mutasir hoti hai. sebum ki pedawar aksar baloghat ke douran bohat ziyada barh jati hai, aksar 15 se 35 saal ki Umar ke darmiyan ziyada miqdaar mein peda hoti hai, jaisa ke jald par andaza lagaya jata hai. estrogen sebum ki pedawar ko bhi mutasir karta hai, khaas tor par ziyada miqdaar mein ."

Can I prevent premenstrual bloating and period diarrhea,"There isn’t a lot of research on how to treat the specific type of stomach complaints that accompany menstruation. As a rule of thumb, when you have diarrhea, it’s good to drink a lot of liquids to replace the ones you lose through your stool. Drinking and eating salt might help, so you can try soups, plain crackers, or sports drinks. Avoid dairy products, soda, and juice. If your period diarrhea lasts for longer than a couple of days, check in with your healthcare provider.

If you struggle with monthly digestive issues around the time of your period, one option is to talk to your healthcare provider about starting a form of contraception that can help you skip your periods, like oral contraceptive pills",kya mein mahvari se pehlay aphara aur muddat ke ishaal ko rokkk sakta hon ?,"haiz ke sath pait ki makhsoos qisam ki shikayaat ka ilaaj karne ke baray mein bohat ziyada tehqeeq nahi hai. angothay ke usool ke tor par, jab aap ko ishaal hota hai, to yeh acha hai ke aap –apne pakhanay ke zariye kho jane walay mayaat ko tabdeel kar saken. namak peenay aur khanay se madad mil sakti hai, lehaza aap soop, saada krikr, ya khelon ke mashrobat aazma satke hain. doodh ki masnoaat, sodda aur juice se parhaiz karen. agar aap ka dorania ishaal chand dinon se ziyada arsa tak rehta hai, to –apne health care faraham kanandah se rabita karen .

Why am I getting a diarrhea during my periods,"When your body releases these prostaglandins (pro-inflammatory chemical-messengers), stimulating your uterus to contract, your endometrial lining is released from your uterus. These prostaglandins, combined with a sharp drop in the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone, are believed to be responsible for gastrointestinal changes prior to and during menstruation.

What is causing my Heavy Menstrual Bleeding,"There are a variety of conditions that can cause HMB. The most common conditions include:
Polyps, or growths in the uterine lining, usually cause spotting or bleeding between periods and sometimes HMB.
Uterine fibroids, benign growths (smooth muscle tumors) on the uterus, also known as leiomyomas, can sometimes cause HMB.

"What should I do for heavy periods, it is very uncomfortable","To treat HMB (heavy menstrual bleeding), you and your healthcare provider need to determine its cause or causes. This can be done by a few simple tests including a blood test, a transvaginal ultrasound and/or taking a sample tissue from the uterine lining (endometrial biopsy).
Some of the causes include polyps, fibroids, cancer, blood clotting, and iron deficiency. Each of these causes would have a different treament.

What does the color of your period blood mean?,"Blood changes color depending on how long it has been exposed to air oxygenation. When you get your periods, your endometrium (inner lining of your uterus) does not separate all at once, it takes time for your endometrial tissue to make its way down through your cervix and vagina. This initial blood and tissue may appear dark red or brown, or even black because it takes longer to exit your body. As tissue breaks away, it leaves torn ends of blood vessels that continue to bleed. This is where the bright red blood you may see during your period comes from. As bleeding slows toward the end of a period, it may once again appear darker red or brown.",aap ke mahvari ke khoon ke rang ka kya matlab hai ?,"khoon ka rang badalta hai is baat par munhasir hai ke yeh sun-hwa ke oxygen ke kitney arsay se samnay aaya hai. jab aap ko mahvari aati hai, to aap ka endometrium ( aap ke reham ki androoni aster/lining ) aik sath allag nahi hota, aap ke endometrial tissue ko aap ke garewa aur andaam nihani/vagina ke zariye neechay anay mein waqt lagta hai. yeh ibtidayi khoon aur baftin gehray surkh ya bhooray, ya yahan tak ke siyah bhi nazar askati hain kyunkay aap ke jism se bahar niklny mein ziyada waqt lagta hai. jaisay hi tissue toot jata hai, yeh khoon ki nalion ke phatay hue suron ko chore deta hai jin se khoon jari rehta hai. yeh woh jagah hai jahan se aap ko mahvari ke douran chamakdar surkh khoon nazar aata hai. jaisa ke aik muddat ke ekhtataam ki taraf khoon behna sust ho jata hai, yeh aik baar phir gehra surkh ya bhoora zahir ho sakta hai ."
"I noticed different colours of blood throughout my period, do they have any significance","At the beginning or end of your period, blood can be a dark brown/red shade and can have a thick consistency—but it’s also normal for the first signs of your period to be bright red and more liquid.

If you notice brown period blood at the start or end of your period, it’s because the blood is older and took longer to leave your uterus. The uterine lining darkens the longer it takes to leave the body.

Period blood clots are normal on the heaviest days of your period and can appear deep red or almost dark black as well.","mein ne apni mahvari ke douran khoon ke mukhtalif rang dekhe, kya un ki koi ahmiyat hai ?","aap ki mahvari ke aaghaz ya ekhtataam par, khoon gehra bhoora saya ho sakta hai aur is mein gaarha mustaqil mizaji ho sakta hai — lekin aap ki mahvari ki pehli alamaat ka roshan surkh aur ziyada maya hona bhi mamool hai .

"What is the difference between my period, spotting, and bleeding?","The lines between menstrual bleeding (i.e. your period), spotting, and non-menstrual bleeding can get kind of confusing. Menstrual bleeding is bleeding that is associated with the shedding of the endometrium at the end of the menstrual cycle. Spotting has different definitions, depending on who you ask.","meri mahvari, dhabbay aur khoon behnay mein kya farq hai ?","mahvari ka khoon behna ( yani aap ki mahvari ), daghdar hona, aur ghair mahvari khoon behnay ke darmiyan ki lakerain uljan ka baais ban sakti hain. mahvari ka khoon behna woh khoon hai jo mahvari ke ekhtataam par endometrium ke behnay se hota hai. spotting ki mukhtalif tareefen hain, is par munhasir hai ke aap kis se puchhte hain ."
what is spotting?,"Researchers and healthcare providers often describe spotting as bleeding that doesn’t require sanitary protection (e.g. you don’t need to use a pad or tampon).

However, this is kind of an arbitrary definition. Even if bleeding isn’t heavy, some people may just choose to use protection anyway.

In theory, spotting can happen at any time during your cycle, so around the period or between periods. Bleeding that doesn’t seem to be associated with the period, such as bleeding during the middle of your cycle, that requires sanitary protection is called non-menstrual bleeding. Sometimes people describe this bleeding as heavy spotting.",spotting kya hai ?,"mohqiqeen aur sehat ki dekh bhaal faraham karne walay aksar spotting ko khoon behnay ke tor par bayan karte hain jis ke liye sinitri tahaffuz ki zaroorat nahi hoti hai ( misaal ke tor par aap ko pad ya tempon istemaal karne ki zaroorat nahi hai ) .

How does spotting differ from light period bleeding?,"Sometimes people describe light bleeding that occurs at the beginning or end of their period as spotting.

It can be hard to differentiate spotting from menstrual bleeding by just looking at the amount. Generally, if you have light bleeding that occurs within two days of your period, you should consider that part of your period, not spotting. However, if it’s very, very light—like you only see a little on your toilet paper—that probably could be considered spotting.

For example, if you have light bleeding on Sunday, no bleeding on Monday, and bleed enough to require a tampon on Tuesday, you should consider Sunday the start of your period.",thora khoon behnay se spotting kaisay mukhtalif hai ?,"baaz auqaat log halkay se khoon behnay ki wazahat karte hain jo un ki muddat ke aaghaz ya ekhtataam par hota hai jaisay dhabba .

Do I need to worry if I am spotting between my periods,"Spotting can come from your upper reproductive tract (like your uterus) or your lower reproductive tract (like your cervix or vagina).

However, heavy spotting or bleeding may be more of a concern. If you’re pregnant and bleeding, call your healthcare provider to let them know what’s going on. 

Spotting can be a symptom of an ectopic pregnancy, a pregnancy that is growing somewhere other than the uterus, usually the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancy bleeding may be coupled with other symptoms including abdominal pain on one side, shoulder pain, and/or dizziness.

Is there any link between physical conditions or infections and spotting?,"Physical conditions, infections, and spotting Spotting can also be caused by infections and physical changes in the reproductive tract, or hormonal imbalances. Physical conditions that can cause spotting episodes include fibroids, polyps and endometriosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which happens when certain pelvic infections (like STIs) go untreated, can also be another culprit for unscheduled spotting. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can cause bleeding from the urethra (where you pee from, between your clitoris and vagina). Consistently spotting after penetrative vaginal intercourse is not considered normal. Bleeding after sex is often caused by an issue with the cervix or polyps. Some people may experience spotting after their first intercourse experience, which is normal.

how do you know when ovulation is happening?,"As ovulation approaches, your body produces more cervical fluid. You can see this fluid in your underwear or on toilet paper when you use the bathroom. It becomes stretchier, clearer, and more wet and slippery—like a raw egg white. This fluid tends to “peak” about 1 to 2 days before ovulation, when estrogen is highest. Some people feel ovulation pain or “mittelschmerz”—a sharp or cramp-like pain felt on either side of the lower abdomen, that can last a few hours or days.

Tracking your basal body temperature (BBT) can also allow you to detect ovulation — as progesterone rises to prepare the uterus for implantation of a fertilized , it causes a slight increase in your BBT. You can also use ovulation prediction tests/kits (OPKs).",aap kaisay jantay hain ke ovulation kab ho raha hai ?,"jaisay jaisay beza qareeb aata hai, aap ka jism ziyada cervical seyal/fluid peda karta hai. jab aap baath room istemaal karte hain to aap is seyal/fluid ko –apne zair jama ya toilet paper par dekh satke hain. yehstretcher, saaf, aur ziyada geela aur phislan ho jata hai — jaisay kachay anday ki safedi. yeh seyal/fluid beza daani/ovary se taqreeban 1 se 2 din pehlay"" chouti"" ki taraf jata hai, jab estrogen sab se ziyada hota hai. kuch log baizvi dard ya"" mittelschmerz"" mehsoos karte hain - pait ke nichale hissay ke dono taraf mehsoos honay wala taiz ya dard jaisa dard, jo chand ghanton ya dinon tak jari reh sakta hai .

I do't have any idea about what uterine fibroid is,"Uterine fibroids are abnormal growths of muscle tissue that form in (or on) the walls of the uterus. Fibroids are benign (not harmful/life threatening), but can cause symptoms such as irregular vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. 

Uterine fibroids are very common. About 3 in 4 women may have them at some point in their lives. They are most common during the reproductive years, and are more likely to occur in people of African ancestry. Uterine fibroids most often cause no symptoms at all and often shrink after menopause. In other cases, untreated fibroids may lead to problems such as heavy bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain or pressure, fertility changes, and complications during pregnancy. Symptoms depend on the size, location, and number of fibroids.",mujhe is baray mein koi andaza nahi hai ke uterine fibroid kya hai .,"uterine fibroids pathon ke bafton ki ghair mamooli nashonuma hain jo reham ki dewaron mein ( ya is par ) banti hain. fibroidssomi hotay hain ( zindagi ke liye nuqsaan da nahi ), lekin yeh andaam nihani/vagina se be qaida khoon behna aur shoroni dard jaisi alamaat ka sabab ban satke hain .

What are its symptoms,"Some of the most common symptoms of uterine fibroids are:

Periods that are heavy, long, and/or painful
Irregular bleeding 
Pelvic pressure or pain 
Frequent urination and difficulty emptying the bladder
Constipation 
Difficulty getting pregnant or carrying to term
In rare cases, uterine fibroids can become very large, twisted, or infected. These situations can create intense symptoms, and may require immediate medical treatment.

Some studies show that pregnancy may cause fibroids to grow slightly bigger in up to 1 in 3 people. This might make some symptoms more noticeable. The most common complication of uterine fibroids in pregnancy is pain, usually felt in the second and third trimesters",is ki alamaat kya hain .,"uterine fibroids ki kuch aam alamaat yeh hain :

Why uterine fibroids happen,"Uterine fibroids occur when muscle cells in the uterus multiply too many times. As cells multiply, lumps of various shapes and sizes are formed. They can be numerous or few—some people might only have one. These lumps can grow on the inner and outer surfaces of the uterus, as well as within the uterine wall.

Research shows the hormones estrogen and progesterone play a role in the growth of uterine fibroids. This is probably why fibroids tend to shrink after menopause, when production of these hormones decreases.",uterine fibroids kyun hotay hain .,"uterine fibroids is waqt hota hai jab bacha daani/uterus mein pathon ke khaliye kayi gina barh jatay hain. jaisay jaisay khaliye barhatay hain, mukhtalif ashkaal aur size ki ganthin banti hain. woh mutadid ya kam ho satke hain — kuch logon ke paas sirf aik ho sakta hai. yeh ganth bacha daani/uterus ki androoni aur bairooni sthon ke sath sath reham ki deewar ke andar bhi barh sakti hai .

So are some people more likely to develop uterine fibroids than others?,"Some people are more likely than others to develop uterine fibroids, and in fact fibroids may be inherited genetically. This means someone is more likely to develop fibroids if a family member has had them. People of African ancestry are significantly more likely to develop them. If you have hypertension or polycystic ovary syndrome, then you are more likely to have uterine fibroids. They are more common in people who have an earlier age at first menstruation (menarche), and people who have not given birth, though this may be because women with fibroids may have difficulty conceiving. Maintaining a diet high in red meat consumption may also increase the risk of uterine fibroids, as may beer consumption.",to kya kuch logon ko uterine fibroids honay ka imkaan doosron ke muqablay mein ziyada hota hai ?,"kuch logon mein uterine fibroids peda honay ka imkaan doosron ke muqablay mein ziyada hota hai, aur haqeeqat mein fibroids jeneati tor par waarsat mein mil satke hain. is ka matlab hai ke agar kisi khandan ke kisi fard ko un mein mubtala ho to kisi ko fibroidshonay ka ziyada imkaan hota hai. africi nasal ke logon mein un ki nashonuma ka ziyada imkaan hai. agar aap ko high blood pressure ya poli stick ovary sndrom hai to aap ko uterin fibroids honay ka ziyada imkaan hai. yeh un logon mein ziyada aam hain jin ki pehli haiz se pehlay ki Umar hoti hai, aur jin logon ne bachay ko janam nahi diya hai, halaank is ki wajah yeh ho sakti hai ke fibroidswali khawateen ko haamla honay mein dushwari ho sakti hai. surkh gosht ki khapat mein ziyada ghiza ko barqarar rakhnay se uterine fibroids ka khatrah bhi barh sakta hai, jaisa ke bear ka istemaal bhi ho sakta hai ."
"Oh, so are there different types of fibroids?","Yes! There are different types of fibroids which can create different symptoms. Fibroids embedded within the uterine wall (intramural fibroids) can change the shape of the uterus, which may cause changes in fertility.

Why do you need to get checked for uterine fibroids,"Uterine fibroids are generally harmless and often go away on their own. When symptoms occur, however, untreated fibroids can interfere with a person’s quality of life and may lead to complications such as anemia (a condition when the body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells to function properly). This can happen when uterine fibroids cause heavy bleeding.

Uterine fibroids may also interfere with the probability of becoming pregnant, and may increase the chance of miscarriage, but more research is needed here. In these cases, treatment can help people become and stay pregnant.

Rarely, uterine fibroids can become very large, twisted, or infected. These situations can create symptoms that are intense, and may require immediate medical treatment, hence it is important to get them checked.",aap ko uterine fibroids ke liye check karwanay ki zaroorat kyun hai ?,"Uterine fibroids aam tor par be zarrar hotay hain aur aksar khud hi chalay jatay hain. jab alamaat zahir hotay hain, taham, ilaaj nah kiye jane walay fibroidskisi shakhs ke mayarِ zindagi mein mudakhlat kar satke hain aur khoon ki kami jaisi paichidgiyan peda kar satke hain ( aisi haalat jab jism mein khoon ke surkh khaliye munasib tareeqay se kaam karne ke liye kaafi nahi hotay ). yeh is waqt ho sakta hai jab uterine fibroids se bohat ziyada khoon beh raha ho .

Activation of the HPA axis is associated with increased levels of cortisol and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The HPA axis, cortisol, and CRH help control stress response in the body. CRH and cortisol release can suppress normal levels of reproductive hormones, potentially leading to abnormal ovulation, anovulation (i.e. no ovulation), or amenorrhea (i.e. absence of menstruation). Furthermore, abnormal levels of CRH in reproductive tissue have been associated with negative pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth",jee haan. kya tanao is mein kirdaar ada karta hai ke mera toleedi nizaam/reproductive system hayatiati tor par kaisay kaam karta hai ?,"haan yeh karta hai! tanao jism mein aik hormonal rastay ko chaalo karta hai jisay hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal( hpa ) mehwar kehte hain. hpa mehwar ko chaalo karna coretesol aur corticrotopin jari karne walay hormone ( crh ) ki barhti hui satah se wabasta hai. hpa mehwar, coretesol, aur crh jism mein tanao ke rad-e-amal ko control karne mein madad karte hain. crh aur coretesol ka ikhraj toleedi hormones ki aam satah ko daba sakta hai, jo mumkina tor par ghair mamooli beza daani/ovary, ovulation ( yani beza nah honay ), ya amenorrhea ( yani mahvari ki Adam mojoodgi ) ka baais bantaa hai. mazeed bar-aan, toleedi bafton mein crh ki ghair mamooli satah ko hamal ke manfi nataij se munsalik kya gaya hai, jaisay qabal az waqt paidaiesh"
 Can my daily life stresses affect how long I get my period?,"There is a possibility that daily life stress affects the length of your cycle. One study of stress in female nurses found associations between high stress and both anovulation and longer cycles, though these findings may be in part due to rotating shift work (working nights), which is common for nurses. Conversely, high stress jobs have also been associated with shorter cycles. Differences in levels and length of stress exposure could cause people’s bodies to respond in different ways. For example, in one study, perimenopausal (approaching menopause) people with high stress were no more likely to have altered cycles than low stress people after one year; however, high stress was linked to shorter menstrual cycles after two years, indicating that symptoms may not present immediately.",kya meri roz marrah ki zindagi ke tanao is baat par assar andaaz ho satke hain ke mujhe apni mahvari kitni der tak aati hai ?,"is baat ka imkaan hai ke rozana ki zindagi ka tanao aap ke cycle ki lambai ko mutasir karta hai. khawateen narson mein tanao ke aik mutalay mein ziyada tanao aur lambay chakkar dono ke darmiyan wabastagi payi gayi, halaank yeh nataij aik hissa mein ghoomnay wali shift work ( kaam ki raton ) ki wajah se ho satke hain, jo narson ke liye aam hai. is ke bar aks, ziyada tanao wali mulaazmaten bhi chhootey chakron se wabasta hain. tanao ki numayesh ki satah aur lambai mein farq logon ke jismon ko mukhtalif tareeqon se jawab dainay ka sabab ban sakta hai. misaal ke tor par, aik tehqeeq mein, ziyada tanao walay afraad mein perimenopause ( rajonoorti/menopause ke qareeb ) aik saal ke baad kam tanao walay logon ke muqablay mein cycle tabdeel karne ka ziyada imkaan nahi tha. taham, ziyada tanao do saal ke baad chhootey mahvari se munsalik tha, jis se zahir hota hai ke alamaat fori tor par zahir nahi ho sakteen ."
I have a very stressful life. Does that affect my period pain?,"In short, yes! Painful menstruation has been linked to working in jobs that are low control, are unsecure and have low coworker support. Stress from the preceding month may also affect the frequency of dysmenorrhea, so someone might not experience painful menstruation as a result of stress until their period the following month. Similarly, people experiencing stress earlier in their cycle were more likely to report severe symptoms during the time leading up to and during menstruation.",meri zindagi bohat dabao wali hai. kya yeh mere mahvari ke dard ko mutasir karta hai ?,"mukhtasir mein, haan! takleef da mahvari ko aisi mlazmton mein kaam karne se jora gaya hai jo kam control hain, ghair mehfooz hain aur saathi karkun ki kam himayat haasil hai. pichlle mahinay ka tanao bhi dysmenorrhea ki tadad ko mutasir kar sakta hai, is liye ho sakta hai ke kisi ko tanao ke nateejay mein takleef da mahvari ka saamna nah ho jab tak ke is ki muddat aglay mahinay tak nah ho. isi terhan, jo log –apne chakkar mein pehlay tanao ka saamna karte thay un mein haiz se pehlay aur is ke douran shadeed alamaat ki ittila dainay ka imkaan ziyada hota tha ."
What to do if I get my periods at school,"1. Know that it’s OK—this has happened to most people who menstruate.
2. Get supplies that you feel comfortable using. Schools usually stock their menstrual products in two places: the girls’ bathrooms and the nurse’s office.
If you are in class, ask to be excused. Ask a friend who menstruates if they have an extra pad or tampon you could borrow. If they don’t, grab some small change just in case you need to use a vending machine to purchase supplies. If your teacher asks what’s happening and you don’t feel comfortable discussing your period in front of others, “stomach problems” are a good go-to.

What to do if I see stains on my clothes,"If you notice period stains on your clothing, pre-wash them with cold water and soap as soon as you can—either still in school or once you get home for the day. Blood is a hard substance to clean off many textiles after it dries, so quick action gives you better chances of getting the stain out completely. However, if a garment remains stained, don’t worry about it too much. Many people have a few pairs of battle-worn “period panties.” These undergarments may be dotted with lighter spots from discharge or dark splatters of blood that just aren’t going away, but they are comfortable and a perfect choice for heavier flow days or days when you expect that your period may start.",agar mein apne kapron par daagh daikhon to kya karoon ?,"agar aap ko –apne kapron par mahvari ke daagh nazar atay hain, to jitni jaldi ho sakay inhen thanday pani aur sabun se pehlay se dho len. khoon aik sakht madah/fluid hai jo bohat se textile ko khushk karne ke baad saaf karta hai, is liye fori karwai aap ko daagh ko mukammal tor par khatam karne ke behtar imkanaat faraham karti hai. taham, agar libaas par daagh rehta hai, to is ke baray mein ziyada fikar nah karen. bohat se logon ke paas jung mein pehnay hue"" period panties"" ke chand jore hotay hain. un zair jaamon par kharij honay walay halkay dhabbon ya khoon ke gehray dhabbay ho satke hain jo abhi khatam nahi ho rahay hain, lekin yeh aaraam da hain aur bohat ziyada bahao walay dinon ya dinon ke liye behtareen intikhab hain jab aap tawaqqa karte hain ke aap ki mahvari shuru ho sakti hai ."
What should I use to collect my blood?,"There are plenty of collection methods you can use. You are most likely to encounter pads and cloths. Pads are the simplest to use and are most often available in school nurses’ offices—all you need to do is place one with the sticky side on your underwear and you’re good to go. Tampons are also frequently available. There is a bit of a learning curve involved with tampons, because they need to be inserted into your vagina. But many people prefer them, so if you feel comfortable, you can give them a shot.

Is my vagina and vulva the same thing?,"That is a nice question, a lot of people don't know that vulva and vagin are two different parts. The vulva is the part of your genitals on the outside of your body — your labia, clitoris, vaginal opening, and the opening to the urethra (the hole you pee out of). While vaginas are just one part of the vulva, many people say “vagina” when they really mean the vulva.

What is a vagina?,"The vagina is the tube between the vulva and the cervix. This tube is the connection between your uterus and the outside world. The vagina is what babies exit through during birth, and what menstrual blood exits through during your period. The vagina is also used for insertion, such as with a penis, fingers, female condoms, sex toys, tampons, or menstrual cups.

The vagina can also act as a route to other parts of the body. During penis-vagina sex, ejaculate is deposited in the vagina, allowing sperm to enter the uterus through the cervix. The walls of the vagina can also be used as an administrative route for medications and contraceptives, such as intervaginal hormone creams, the hormonal vaginal contraceptive ring, or vaginal suppository medications.",andaam nihani/vagina kya hai ?,"andaam nihani/vagina vulva aur garewa ke darmiyan aik tube hai. yeh tube aap ke reham aur bairooni duniya ke darmiyan conection hai. andaam nihani/vagina woh hai jis se bachay paidaiesh ke douran bahar nikaltay hain, aur aap ki mahvari ke douran jis se khoon nikalta hai. andaam nihani/vagina ko daakhil karne ke liye bhi istemaal kya jata hai, jaisay ke uzoo tanasul, unglio, khawateen ke kndom, jinsi khilonay, mahvari ke cupp ke sath .

Does my vagina change with age?,"Yes, it does. The vagina can change a lot throughout a person's life. An average adult vagina is slightly curved, but every body is different, and there’s no such thing as a too small or too large vagina.

The vagina is strongly influenced by hormonal changes throughout the body. During the reproductive years after menarche (the first menstrual period) and before menopause, more layers of tissue are present lining the vagina, due to stimulation from higher estrogen levels in the body.

After menopause, when estrogen is lower, the walls of the vagina become thinner and frailer, which can cause symptoms of vaginal dryness and decreased vaginal secretions. This may result in discomfort during sex and increase the chances of vaginal irritation or infection ",kya meri andaam nihani/vagina Umar ke sath badalti hai ?,"haan yeh karta hai. andaam nihani/vagina 1 shakhs ki poori zindagi mein bohat kuch badal sakti hai. aik ost baaligh andaam nihani/vagina qadray Khamida hoti hai, lekin har jism mukhtalif hota hai, aur bohat choti ya bohat barri andaam nihani/vagina jaisi koi cheez nahi hai .

Will it change during pregnancy too?,"Yes it will! The vagina is also influenced by changing hormone levels during pregnancy. Increased blood flow is directed to the pelvis, causing a deeper color change to the vulva and vagina. Throughout pregnancy, the connective tissue of the vaginal walls progressively relaxes, in preparation for the delivery of a baby. After delivery, the vagina and vaginal opening temporarily widen, but 6-12 weeks post-delivery, the vagina returns to its pre-pregnancy size. As people age, the walls of the vagina become more relaxed, and the diameter of the vagina becomes wider. ",kya yeh hamal ke douran bhi badal jaye ga ?,"haan yeh ho ga! hamal ke douran hormone ki satah mein tabdeeli se andaam nihani/vagina bhi mutasir hoti hai. khoon ke bahao mein izafah sahrooni ki taraf jata hai, jis ki wajah se volva aur andaam nihani/vagina ka rang gehra hota hai. hamal ke douran, andaam nihani/vagina ki dewaron ke marboot tissue aahista aahista aaraam karte hain, bachay ki paidaiesh ki tayari mein. dilyori ke baad, andaam nihani/vagina aur andaam nihani/vagina ka khilna earzi tor par chaura ho jata hai, lekin dilyori ke 6-12 haftay baad, andaam nihani/vagina –apne hamal se pehlay ke size mein wapas ajati hai. jaisay jaisay logon ki Umar barhti jati hai, andaam nihani/vagina ki diivaaren ziyada aaraam da hoti jati hain, aur andaam nihani/vagina ka qutar wasee hota jata hai ."
I was wondering if the size of my vagina will affect my sexual abilities,"When it comes to sexual satisfaction, vaginal size does not affect sexual function.

"During the menstrual cycle, how does my vagina change?","The vagina also changes in response to hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. Around mid-cycle, when estrogen is highest, vaginal tissue becomes thicker and fuller.

The cervix, at the top of the vagina, moves and changes shape throughout the cycle. Before and after the fertile window, the cervix is low and can be felt in the vagina, with a firm texture, and the hole in the center of the cervix is closed. During the fertile window, the hole in the cervix opens to facilitate the entrance of sperm into the uterus, the cervix rises higher in the vagina, and is softer when touched","mahvari ke douran, meri andaam nihani/vagina kaisay badalti hai ?","mahvari ke hormonal utaar charhao ke jawab mein andaam nihani/vagina mein bhi tabdeeli aati hai. wast cycle ke ird gird, jab astrogrn sab se ziyada hota hai, andaam nihani/vagina ke tissue gaarha aur bhara ho jata hai .

I am curious of how my vagina (private part) changes during sex,"The vagina can undergo more rapid changes, such as during sexual activity. When a person with a vagina is sexually aroused, increased blood flow is directed towards the genitals, causing the vaginal tissue to become engorged with blood, and additional lubrication to be produced. This fluid is called arousal fluid.

During sexual excitement, the vagina expands by lengthening and widening in shape. This shape change happens as the uterus and cervix are drawn higher into the pelvis, which creates more space and moves the cervix farther away from any semen that is ejaculated into the vagina. This allows time for the semen to mix with female genital fluids, stimulating the sperm to undergo the physical changes necessary for fertilizing an egg",mein janna chahti hon ke jinsi taluqaat ke douran meri andaam nihani/vagina ( private part ) kaisay badalti hai .,"andaam nihani/vagina ziyada taizi se tabdeelion se guzar sakti hai, jaisay ke jinsi sargarmi ke douran. jab andaam nihani/vagina ke sath 1 shakhs jinsi tor par bedaar hota hai to, khoon ke bahao mein izafah jinsi aaza ki taraf hota hai, jis ki wajah se andaam nihani/vagina ke tissue khoon se bhar jatay hain, aur izafi phislan peda hoti hai. is seyal/fluid ke arosal fluid kehte hain .

How to clean my vagina?,"If you want to wash your vagina, you should wash do it with warm water. If you’d like, you can use a mild soap that won’t irritate the skin — but this isn’t necessary. Spread your lips apart and gently cleanse around the folds, using a clean washcloth or your hands. Avoid getting water or soap inside your vagina.

In addition to washing your vulva, it’s a good idea to wash the anus and the area between your vulva and anus every day. It’s best to wash “front to back” — in other words, wash your vulva first and then your anus. Otherwise, bacteria from the anus can spread to your vagina, which can cause infections.",apni andaam nihani/vagina ko kaisay saaf karoon ?,"agar aap apni andaam nihani/vagina ko dhona chahtay hain, to aap ko usay garam pani se dhona chahiye. agar aap chahain to, aap halkay sabun ka istemaal kar satke hain jo jald ko kharish nahi kere ga - lekin yeh zaroori nahi hai. –apne honton ko allag allag karen aur tahoon ke ird gird aahista se saaf karen, saaf wash clothe ya –apne hathon se. apni andaam nihani/vagina ke andar pani ya sabun haasil karne se guraiz karen .

Do I ovulate on the contraceptive pill?,"No. If you take your pill consistently and correctly, you shouldn’t ovulate. This is the primary way the pill prevents pregnancy. In a usual (no-pill) cycle, the body’s natural reproductive hormones fluctuate up and down, taking your body through a process of preparing an egg for release, releasing that egg, and preparing your uterus to accept a potentially fertilized egg.

The hormones in the contraceptive pill stop and prevent your ovaries from preparing and releasing eggs. They stop the usual hormonal “cycling”, including ovulation, the typical growth of the endometrium, and the natural period, meaning you ideally should not be ovulating and can't get pregnant if taken correctly.",kya mein contraceptive ki goli par beza/ovulate karti hon ?,"nahi, agar aap apni goli musalsal aur sahih tareeqay se letay hain, to aap ko beza/ovulate nahi hona chahiye. yeh goli hamal ko roknay ka bunyadi tareeqa hai. aik mamool ke chakkar mein, jism ke qudrati toleedi/reproductive hormones oopar neechay hotay hain, aap ke jism ko aik anday ko rihayi ke liye tayyar karne, is anday ko jari karne, aur aap ke bacha daani/uterus ko mumkina tor par fertilizers anday ko qubool karne ke liye tayyar karte hain .

Why is my bleeding different on the contraceptive pill?,"The contraceptive pill prevents the lining of your uterus (your endometrium) from growing thicker, as it would in a typical menstrual cycle.

Can I get my periods early,"Yes, that is possible. If your period comes early once in a while, it is likely normal and not a cause for concern. Menstruation might start early because of a change in your lifestyle, intense physical exercise, illness, or stress.

They're actually 2 different phases!  

Perimenopause can be as short as a few months or last up to 8 years. On average, it lasts around 4–5 years.

In that same study, of those who were still menstruating at age 45, about 1 in 3 reported menstrual irregularity. At age 52, about 1 in 10 reported that they were still menstruating normally.

Your genetics, environment, and lifestyle may all play a role in how you experience perimenopause, and the timing of perimenopause and menopause. People who reach menopause later in life tend to have shorter transitions. Smokers tend to be slightly younger at perimenopause and have shorter transitions, reaching menopause about a year earlier than average.

How will my menstrual cycle changes before and during perimenopause,"You may notice that your period arrives slightly earlier each cycle (ie shorter menstrual cycles) and is heavier.

As you approach perimenopause, your hormone levels begin to change. This happens before your periods become unpredictable. For some people, one of the earliest signs of perimenopause is that their periods arrive slightly earlier—meaning that their menstrual cycle shortens, by ~2–4 days. Before perimenopause, estrogen levels can actually rise for a while, and progesterone levels typically decrease . This is what shortens the follicular phase, and may also cause other changes, symptoms, or sensations. You may notice changes to the heaviness of your period during this time. Lower progesterone—with or without higher estrogen—may also lead to heavier periods, which is more common in early perimenopause.",perimenopause se pehlay aur is ke douran mera mahvari kaisay badlay ga .,"aap mehsoos kar satke hain ke aap ka mahvari har chakkar se thora pehlay aata hai ( yani mahvari ke chhootey daur ) aur yeh ziyada bhaari hai .

What happens next?,"Later, you may have irregular cycles and bleeding changes. 

As the number of follicles in your ovaries decreases, ovulation becomes less common, and hormone levels start to fluctuate more and more. Menstrual cycles might become longer, and then progressively more variable—longer and shorter, with menstrual periods that are heavier, lighter, and far less predictable . 

The heaviness of your period will also fluctuate. Cycles without ovulation may have lighter periods, while periods that come after a long cycle may be long. On average, about 6 of the final 10 cycles before menopause are prolonged and anovulatory (where ovulation doesn’t occur). In the 1-2 years before menopause, it’s common for cycles to last more than 5 weeks. ",uge kya hota hai ?,"baad mein, aap ko fasid chakkar aur khoon behnay mein tabdeelian ho sakti hain .

What else should I know regarding menopause and perimenopause?,"Some more information regarding bleeding in perimenopause and menopause that you should be aware of.

If the endometrium becomes too thick and irregular, it can develop into cancer, but this can usually be prevented if caught early. Also, In some cases, bleeding continues after menopause. It is easy to mistake this type of bleeding for symptoms of perimenopause, which may mislead someone to think they have not reached full-menopause when they actually have.

Uterine polyps are very common. They occur most commonly leading up to and after menopause, your nani might know someone. Small polyps may cause no symptoms at all and can go away on their own. In other cases, untreated polyps may cause symptoms that affect quality of life and can carry a small chance of becoming cancerous. They may also affect fertility, but research on this topic is still lacking.

Why do uterine polyps happen?,"Uterine polyps occur when cells of the uterine lining (the endometrium) multiply too many times, leading to lumps. These lumps often resemble hanging sacs or mushrooms made of tissue. Most are very small, but can range in size from a few millimeters, to several centimeters in diameter. Polyps can be numerous or few, and some people might only have one. 

To give you some more information, some people are more likely than others to develop uterine polyps. They are most common in people who are perimenopausal and postmenopausal. If you are obese, you must also know that obesity also makes people significantly more likely to develop polyps. If you have taken the the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, this can be a contributing factor too.
