You got a point?,"Why would he say that?  Why even think about it, when he is with you?","That’s called losing respect for him. It’ll niggle at you forever if you stay with him.

Short story: i was curvy in a skinny way when I was  in my mid 20s. However I’m 5’7 so average height, not short, not tall. The guy I was dating said to me “I can never get tiny petite women” so I pondered that for months and decided he needed to be gone. It ate at me for those months. Diminished all feelings I had for him in the end. He was a moron and completely clueless as to why I was breaking it off with him even though I very clearly outlined it. He got offended when I laughed out loud at his mystified expression.

Men are clueless. Better off without that kind of man. Trust your instinct."

95,Just swinging by to say 'sealioning' is an absolutely perfect description.,I appreciate hearing there is an Asian twoX I can offer to my friends.,"Old Asian lady over here, just simmering with rage because of the news out of Atlanta, and pretty much out of everywhere lately.

But  when you're an Asian woman, you often get this extra-terrible hybrid of the two. 

There are people who will have the nerve to tell you that it's *good* to be fetishized. They tell you at least someone finds you attractive and desirable. But fetishism is what got us the Atlanta shooting. A white man wanted to sexually exploit Asian women. And when we no longer pleased him, he blamed us for his personal failures, and then *HE KILLED 6 OF US*.

Bigotry all comes from the same place. That's why we need to recognize intersectionality.
