0,"Right. Moderates exist between liberals and conservatives. Liberals are out here handing pepsi's to cops to end police brutality, while we have numerous GOP leaders actively ranting about replacement theory and jews. So the midpoint between those two is firmly in the territory of fascism","Exactly. Extremist left perspectives *do exist*, but they have little support. Whereas the GOP actively refuses to publicly disavow the extremism of its own party members.","maybe they're considered unthinkable lunacy because people aren't openly saying ""hey, we should do all those things"" when the right are blatantly and currently doing the thing they're saying they want to do

""well, the nazi's want to exterminate the jews, but the left want to end poverty, homelessness, and hunger... hmmm... which to choooose...""","Abolition of private property. Confiscation of privately owned land, perhaps. The *extreme* stuff, y'know?

The nature of the US political landscape at the moment is this: extreme right views are openly entertained by members of government, while extreme leftist views are considered unthinkable lunacy.","what are extreme leftist political views

what would be an 'extremist liberal' view lol","Did you not read my post? It means you don't support extreme political views.

 So they are completely anti racist because being racist is an extreme view. Not being racist is not an extreme view. Its a moderate view. Why is it moderate because its a fundamental view that shouldn't need to be called Liberal to be allowed. 

They believe everybody EVERYBODY gets rights because to be denied a right is an extreme political view. 

Your logic is that only liberals think you shouldn't be racist or believe everybody should have human rights don't you see how fucked up that is? Moderates believe the same thing. They don't view if as extreme to not want this.","ok so you're a moderate, what does that actually mean

do only some people get rights? are you only 'kind of' anti-racist? let's see what the fascists do before stopping them kind of moderate?",[removed]
1,"nope, communists aren't liberals. Idk where you went to school, but you need a refund. There's more than 2 parties","Yes because it is. 

I'm not saying it is a negative. But if you believe in communism you fall on the far left of an extreme Liberal view. 

That's fact.","The question was

you said communism",Do you just not read the response? The question was name extreme views. Not what are they advocating,"ahh yes because the typical liberal is totally advocating for communism. heck i doubt the typical liberal could even define communism.

Communism.

2,"They do get information on what the total charges were and how much you are disputing as well. So yes, they can figure it out if they keep good enough records and are willing to spend the time to go through their records.

It really depends on how much information you gave the vendor. It also kind of depends on how many of these credit care disputes they get.","Thank you for responding! 

Can the company not cross-reference the disputed amount with the charges in their customer database? 

Based on their responses to the google reviews, I wouldn't be surprised if they retaliated out of petty spite.","My parents owned a small business, and as a result I got a chance to read over and respond to the disputes. The merchants don't get information like your name, address, phone number or anything. Of your credit card number, the middle 8 digits are X'ed out. They get to see the reasons why you are disputing the charge and some basic instructions on how the merchant can respond with their side of the story. If they don't respond, you win by default (provided the dispute resolution agent can fit your complaints into a valid category).

There is a risk of retaliation, but it somewhat depends on what information you gave them already. If you didn't leave your name or address, then there's almost no chance of it happening.

Of the credit card disputes I've been involved in (which admittedly isn't much), there hasn't been any retaliation.

Further, from a merchant's perspective, it kind of doesn't make sense to retaliate. The money's gone. Retaliation won't bring back the disputed charges, can result in more bad reviews, and can land them in trouble with the law. It isn't worth it for a business owner. And the employees certainly aren't going to care enough to retaliate.",My only concern is that once my cc does the chargeback they'll know my identity and may attempt to retaliate against me.,I've gone this route myself and then helped friends and family resolve disputes as well a handful of times. The credit card dispute resolution is very consumer friendly.,Thank you for your advice. I'm more seriously considering this route now.,"They won’t I promise. They just mention you were scammed and they’ll guide you through the steps to get it refunded. I wouldn’t trust this company if they make people sign NDAs and hire shitty makeup artists.

Like teen girls can do makeup and hair better than whatever laughable people they have there? I saw the reviews with some edited pictures - wow are so so bad. The skin smoothing is soo obvious and kinda fake looking. I wonder if all their business is through prizes

Edit: looking at the website, that artist definitely needs more training. everyone has the exact same makeup look, lip shape, brows. no wings, no creativity. simple makeup from a beginner",I can't even imagine trying to approach my cc company about this...i feel like they'll just laugh me off the phone lol
3,:( but also thank you for having a conscience!,"Haha, I would hope to able to name every tactic,  I paid thousands of dollars to be taught that ""system"".  I just never had the heart to actually implement it,  which is when I realized I will never be really wealthy.","Holy crap, you identified every single thing they did! No joke, that is insane and incredibly evil. I'm actually shocked right now that you were able to name every single tactic and strategy they used from beginning to end. I'm very impressed.","If they post their prices, it allows you to price-shop. There is literally more than one training package (I paid to do one) where they teach this. It's called IPS (in person selling, super creative /s) and relies on holding your images hostage, together with every single dodgy sales technique to pressure you into buying a package. 

I'll wager they used reciprocality ( I gave you a shoot, you owe me one), the sunk cost fallacy (well you've already spent the time/effort, and you wouldn't want to lose that, right?). Not to mention going through each and every image, taking over an hour, and wearing you down until you would give them your money simply to get out of there.

It's a ""sales system"", and it's evil.","It definitely felt like the owner (who is male) set this up to purposefully be disingenuous. Also, why don't they post the prices on their website? How is that so hard to do?","I genuinely feel bad for you.  Photographers like this ruin the industry,  for both the customer and other photographers.  And yes,  the fake claim of ""female empowerment"" is particularly grating as  this was a male photographer exploiting a power dynamic to rip you off.","I think if only one or two aspects had been bad, I would've been able to look beyond that and still enjoy myself and the end results. But to have so many things leave a terrible taste in my mouth, end up with photos i absolutely dislike, and to come out of it feeling so bad about myself because they didn't listen to me at all, is literally the opposite of what they were claiming their photoshoots were all about (which was wOmeN's eMpoWeRmeNt). Yes, way to empower me by not listening to me at all.","Me and my wife tried running a boudoir studio for a while,  but quit because we couldn't stay afloat without these predatory business practices, such as the ""free "" shoot that is anything but.

Sorry to hear about your bad experiences,  but from the business side at least, this is par for the course. 

The MUA/pinterest complaints are very valid though. If they want to charge premium prices ( which they do) then they have to provide a premium experience. 

We still do it for fun, and if you were in New Zealand I'd offer to do a shoot for you, but you may have success going on to photography groups and looking for people who do it for the love of the game,  instead of just as a paycheck.  That opens up a slew of other issues (like pervs posing as photographers) so I do feel compassion for women who simply want good shots at a decent price."
4,"Omg, every time I see that pic as a profile pic, I know that no good will be found in the comment it's attached to.","So so many dudes take the picture in their vehicle, hat on, sour facial expression, with the phone practically in their lap. Bonus points if they wear sunglasses.. Nobody is gonna look good like that!","And if it's what I'm thinking of, it's a misinterpretation of the blog post.

[Here's an example of someone misinterpreting it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/5i6m5y/women_have_unrealistic_views_of_how_men_look/)

Here's the quote that everyone seems to notice: 

>women rate an incredible 80% of guys as worse-looking than medium.

Here's the *entire* rest of the point that everyone seems to miss:

>when it comes to actual messaging, women shift their expectations only just slightly ahead of the curve, which is a healthier pattern than guys’ pursuing the all-but-unattainable.

Women message men at a rate that's on a pretty realistic bell curve, even though they're not ""rating"" them as highly. It's MEN who only reach out to the ""hottest"" women.

And just another big obvious point: look at the ""average"" women's pics in the post. They're posed. Well lit. The women are wearing nice clothes. An effort was made. The photos are showing these women at their best, they're flattering.

Look at the example men's pics in the post. One has red eye ffs. They're not posed or well-lit. Only one out of four comes close, in my opinion, to showing how attractive that dude probably is IRL.

What this ACTUALLY shows is that women do not think men's *profile pictures* are very flattering. 

And I'd ask anyone who's ever glanced at a dating site, do you honestly think they are? Do you think men usually put effort into their pics? 

Because just looking around, I'd say, no shit sherlock to all of this, people aren't very attractive in unflattering pictures, and men seem on average to not put much effort into having flattering pictures on dating sites.",It originated from OK Cupid data.,"I believe that statistic originated from tinder/OLD, sounds like some genius has taken it out of context.","Lol they can't get a date on Tinder because all of the women have left the app. Isn't it something like 80% of Tinder users are men? So yeah, on Tinder, 10% of the huge population of men are getting dates with 90% of the tiny population of women, because that is what will happen when there are 5 men for every woman. That's not what's happening in the real world where the dating pool is closer to 50/50.",">	Soo like we collectively wait and pass around the same 10% guys? Lolololol

5,"Maybe it's just me, but my general impression is that men generally don't do pictures like women.  Watching the timeline of posts from acquaintances (not ""influencers"", celebrities, or advertisers), women largely outnumber men in sharing pictures of people.","I doubt it’s an intentional effort ‘not to show you care that much’.  More like they use that as an excuse not to put in the work.  

I get it, it’s difficult to put yourself out there.  Maybe you’re shy or lack confidence, maybe you have a hard time with all this.  But again, that’s when you ask friends for help.  Or family.  If you don’t have anyone in your life that supports you, you may be a lovely person but you need to work on developing your interpersonal skills before you get yourself into a relationship.  

But most guys are just being lazy.  Maybe it’s 30% fear, 70% laziness.  And it can turn into this angry ‘take me as I am’ kind of attitude.  One that extends to the rest of their life.  Chances are they don’t exactly take much time to clean their house.  Or themselves.  And honestly, even when I was younger and stupider, I didn’t have time for that crap.","I was kind of wondering if there was an intentional effort to try to appear not to ""care too much"", but the last time I commented about this on reddit I was unironically yelled at about how unreasonable it is to expect a man to get a nice pic, outdoors, in decent clothes. 

I didn't think that was a high bar, but I am clearly wrong (and should feel bad).

So maybe this is actually representative? I agree, I'm not surprised women are turned off by it.","I’ve always thought this about dating apps, that someone who puts minimal effort into his profile is going to also put minimal effort into a date or a relationship .

I never expected photoshop, a fashion show, or a professional photo shoot.  But maybe Google some tips on how to make your profile better?  Have friends take a few candid shots of you doing fun stuff?

11,"...did you not read the post? 2nd to last paragraph starts off with ""As a man""",I’m pretty sure OP is a woman. Look around. You’re on a woman-centered sub. Take your grievances to r/menslib and work out a solution amongst yourselves,"Ok, sure, it's men's fault, why not. Admitting that doesn't change the problem or the solution though, because the solution isn't to make the shaming stop (which is never going to happen), it's to be the one person that helps instead of shaming. OP asked what he as an individual could do and that's the answer.","It absolutely matters who is doing the shaming. Once again for the folks in back: *other men shaming you is not something women can solve, so leave us out of it*","I didn't blame anyone for it. It doesn't matter who's at fault because the shaming is absolutely a thing that happens and I guarantee it's not going to stop in our lifetime no matter what any individual does, or at least not soon enough to matter for anyone reading this. OP asked the best way to approach the problem and I answered what and why.","Who shames them? Because it is not women who do that. And if men are shaming men for their sexual success or lack thereof this is a massive you problem that we cannot influence in any way externally. And we categorically not going to offer ourselves to prove a point. We are not playthings, we are people.","Getting involved earlier + empathy. Unsuccessful men get *hardcore* shamed, just think of the comment 'why can he get a relationship but not me?' for proof of that. That shame disincentivizes them from asking people for help, so they search for it on their own, and find incel/redpill because there's nothing else to find online.","This is kinda the problem.

That women are not a hivemind and you have to treat them as the individuals they are.

Who gives a fuck if they want validation and sex? They do this to themselves. They stalk women in non-social venues.

Continually put women down for every fashion and career and hobby choice women make. 


&nbsp;

There isn’t anything more tragic than the “older” woman who isn’t married— they NEED to be saved from a life of cat friends  /s

I’m hoping younger women can deprogram their brains quicker than I did.","Because you don’t see men as a means to an end. You see them as whole people, independent and self-sufficient with hobbies and interests and infinite paths to choose. No limits. 


&nbsp; 


Men don’t see women the same way. They assume women are waiting to be picked, waiting for motherhood and baking and cleaning. Need evidence? Visit any pick up or men’s sub and watch how men chastise women who reject or ignore them. Read how men demand attention and compliments. Watch them claim childfree women will spend their middle aged and elderly years lonely and miserable because their destiny and purpose is motherhood. 

Watch them blame women for failing to validate them, blame women for SA and catcalling. Make fun of women for fashion choices and going to the gym. 


In short, who gives a fuck what they think? They limit women to subservient, subordinate roles to men. Let those men wallow and suffer alone. They can choose to treat women as human beings with the same natural rights to happiness and autonomy. Those who don’t? 


Fuck ‘em."

As far as mainstream politics, he’s more left, but it’s still disingenuous to call him leftist because *again* we shouldn’t be ascribing to fascist definitions of what is and isn’t the left in the US. 

Also apologies for misreading your statement about him being on the left of the American political spectrum. But it’s still not the whole truth to call him a radical leftist, and entirely disingenuous. Like lol","Ummm… That commenter was me… 

And I explicitly mentioned that I was talking about the US multiple times.

Fucking read. Ffs.","You didn’t say the far left of American politics, nor were we talking within the   American range of left/right. As the commenter before you mentioned, the Overton window has shifted so far to the right in the US and leftists have been assassinated in droves so a proper leftist force does not exist in American politics. Sanders is, at most, a liberal. He’s center-left, not far left. He’s a capitalist for god’s sake. 

As u/Latvia mentioned, stop letting right wing political extremism highjack political language.","How? Out of 100 senators he’s probably what? The 99th or 100th furthest left?

I get what you’re saying, the Overton window in the US has been collapsed into oblivion, but Bernie is 100% on the far left of that line. 

You’re describing his politics in relation to your own, but your politics do not equal political reality. The vast majority of Americans hold views that are to the right of Bernie, therefore he’s on the radical left of the American political spectrum. I’m a radical leftist as well. We shouldn’t be scared of that label.","Not leftists. Your label was accurate. But we've let right wing extremism hijack political language. What is realistically politically center is called extreme left by theocratic fascists, and now everyone is just going with it. Sanders is not a leftist. He's not even truly ""liberal.""

30,"Love how you can speak for all men and putting down ""women like me"" for having reasonable standards and trying to fear monger me for the time I get older. What are you projecting onto me?

There's a multitude of reasons for men or women being single or not. Ever thought that more older women are single by choice because they prefer it that way because the relationship before wasn't working anymore and men stay in the relationship because it benefits them more emotionally?

There are multiple variables playing into this. Women also tend to live longer than men, among the single women over 65 are most likely also quite a lot of widows. How does the percentage of single people say anything about their desirability anyway? There are people who are desirable, but who are still single. Some people just get into relationships out of fear of being alone or for stability.

I don't even actively date at my current age, so if I were a guy, my life would pretty much be the same because I don't date either way. Or at least I'm not actively looking. 

I've seen so many socalled average Joes having girlfriends and being generally quite successful with dating. And no, they're not the top 10% of men, they're your everyday guy from next door that don't really stand out from the mass, but they found someone that matches them.

It's usually the ones being insecure or having poor social skills who might have a depressing experience with dating, men or women. Or they just had bad luck.

All I said was that you shouldn't depend your happiness on a relationship and this applies to every sex and you're coming with statistics to proove that women become less desirable among the broad mass, even though no one was talking about this.
My point still stands regardless.
It's far more complicated than ""young women are too picky because they're still pretty and have more options until they get older"". Numbers are not telling the whole story.","What exactly implies that I think too high of myself? Because I said that I enjoy my own company and don't let myself pressure into a relationship? Please.
Also since when is online dating reflective of the real world? Tinder works much differently than meeting someone in the real world and most people only use Tinder for hookups anyway.
It could be that women's desirability on online dating declines more after a certain age compared to men's desirability, but why would I care? I don't use online dating anyway and when I'm older, I don't want anything to do with men in their midlife crisis who look for women the same age as their daughter or niece.
Like if less men are into me when I'm older, it doesn't matter because it only takes one person to click with for a relationship. Quality over quantity.","Girl even in online dating it's show women have much much steeper decline in desirability compared to men their age .that women when they are in their 40s men start becoming more desirable than them in dating(if you want to me to link the studies I can do it.they are reliable they have 200k big ass sample size)

This literally online dating the platform that women 90%  the power in dating.

I actually think older women are extremely attractive I don't believe this incel rehotic that women age badly .

But ask in guy in their 30s and tell them how dating was in their early 20s and they probably will have PTSD from how young women pickinees.

. I agree with all your statements and I don't side you friend but you seem to think too high of your self because you think you're independent women who enjoy her time alone. But let's be serious try being average Joe in his  20s and let's see how you respond to loneliness and singleness.

TLDR:  I agree with you in everything in this post but I still think you're pretentious young beautiful woman who say that she enjoy being single and say ""singleness isn't bad"" because she has power in dating over men because she is attractive young women. 
That why I'm telling you get old and let's see how you respond to singleness when men start being picky.","Don't even try the old ""hitting the wall in your 30s"" line like women turn into ugly hags the day they turn 35, that's bs.
Men have their right to be picky as much as I do and if they don't want me, they don't want me. If I don't want them, I don't want them, simple as that. There will always be people willing to date, no matter at what age and if an older guy only wants to date younger women, so be it. You say yourself they're apparently shitty, so why would I want to be with them then? If a man in his mid 30s has unrealistic expectations, that's not a man, that's a manchild.

Eh, he looks alright, average, I'd say, but not my type at all.

>Is he trying to be your ""nice guy""?

I hope not, and I don't have a bf.

>How's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' POV? Where is him empathy?

He is able to understand others' POV, but when it comes to this topic, he has tunnel vision, unfortunately. Usually, he is kind, takes care of his friends, is considerate towards everyone. It's not as black and white and it seems like once the topic of being alone is mentioned, his inner demons come out. I understand your sentiment though and appreciate your empathy with me! I'll set much stronger boundaries with him for sure.","How's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' POV? Where is him empathy? Is he physically attractive? He literally treats half of the population as subhuman. Is he trying to be your ""nice guy""? Do you have a bf? Once you have a bf, he probably will be mad at you, disappear and talk smack behind you.","Oof you read him like an open book 😅 

He is pretty much looking for someone doing the emotional labor. During the conversation, I felt like he was dumping all his sorrow onto me and I could just try to shield it off of me, without any consideration of how it makes me feel when I try to encourage him and he just keeps wallowing in self pity.

I mean I don't think he's deliberately trying to manipulate, but more or less subconsciously. But I think you're right, I had a similar talk with him this summer and what triggered it was that while we were talking about the topic of dating and whether love at first sight is a thing or not, I said that attraction at first sight is definitely a thing and that I do pay attention to the way a guy looks and the way he carries himself.

Meaning I want to be physically attracted. I didn't mean I want my man to look like some sort of model, just someone who I find cute in his own imperfect way. Of course personality is important, but I do need that attraction, the chemistry. Not that much of a revolutionary concept, isn't it? lol To him it apparently is.

It could very well be that this completely normal statement made him mad because it showed him that women care about more than the bare minimum and are not as desperate as him. Just like with my best friend ""Emily"" from the post, just hearing that a woman is also able to be happy without a man made him bitter enough to react like that.

Coming to think of it, he is talking a lot about financial topics and his plans in that regard and is always talking endlessly about the details of a certain topic that could have been compressed into one or two sentences (to a point where no one is even really listening anymore because no one cares that much) and to lowkey try to impress people with his intelligence.

The thing is, apart from that he's a good guy, but he has a crap ton of issues he needs to unpack, but he doesn't realize that. Otherwise he's fun to be around but whenever that topic comes up, it's exhausting. I feel kinda torn because I don't want to ditch him as a person completely, but if he keeps getting on my nerves like that, I have to ask myself if I want to keep hanging out with a guy like that or have an honest talk with him. Because dating wise, I'd never entertain a guy like him either.","He sounds like a typical low emotional intelligence guy to me. Instead of working and self reflecting he just continues the denial and it snowballs into inceldom. 

Men like this are desperate because they’re relying on their partner to fulfill a lot of their needs. Self acceptance, stability.. sometimes even entertainment. So not having a partner is just him bouncing to one side of the room to the other because he can’t work on his own self acceptance or entertain himself properly. He desperately doesn’t want to be “alone” because he dumps basic human needs on women. It’s like walking around with a huge basket of dirty clothes and crying that you need it washed asap (only by a woman) because you never bothered to learn how to do it yourself. 

These guys also love to strategize relationships because they don’t see the other gender as an equal. It’s always a red flag when someone is ok with potentially “manipulating” their way into having and maintaining a relationship. Like pick up artist culture. 
Of course he is not going to like women having their own standards and wanting to be with attractive men.. that means he can’t control or manipulate them into dating him. They use money/income, social status, “intelligence” as date baits and it’s pathetic.

I don’t think it’s worth the time and effort to deal with these guys anymore, seriously. They’re tricky and insecure enough to try to bring you down with them."

>I always have a pretty good hard separation of people I can see having friendships with and people I'd have a sexual relationship with

I can understand that. To me though, the possibility is always there. I don't really picture a romantic relationship as a sexual relationship though, the sex part of it is more of an ""add-on"" but I also view sexual relationships a bit different than normal, like I'm perfectly fine with my romantic partner having other sexual partners so long as they're only sexual partners, meaning no going on dates, etc. That's definitely not the norm though.

I guess you can say that I compartmentalize the different aspects of a relationship and am capable of viewing them more individually rather than entirely holistic though they are obviously all connected in a relationship as well.

>Whether you like it or not, from the very second you meet someone your brain is already trying to figure out where to place them in your hierarchy of relationships. 

Not necessarily. I tend to go into all relationships as friendships. But that's a me thing, as I'm not really interested in romantic relationships. I always have a pretty good hard separation of people I can see having friendships with and people I'd have a sexual relationship with (and of course there's overlap there, FWBs etc.). But I guess I'm an outlier in this; I know my disinterest in romance isn't the norm, I accept that (also I'm a widower. I just have no interest in ever being in a romantic relationship with another person)",">So, as one guy to another, I gotta say..your mindset might seem innocent but it genuinely seems like you're getting into friend groups in the hopes of romantic encounters developing, with people who aren't aware of this (but who might suspect it) and that isn't really fair to the people who just want their friends to be friends. Honesty goes a long way my dude.

But this is kind of an ""unwritten rule"" dictated by human nature. You don't start off loving someone, you *fall* in love with them over time so naturally you're most likely to develop feelings for people you spend the most time with, ie; people within your friend group.

>The issue with your stance of ""building friends groups of potential partners""

I thought I clarified this pretty well, I don't build friend groups of potential partners and I certainly don't add people to a friend group solely because I view them as a potential partner, I add them to my friend group because we inherently connect as friends, meaning we have commonalities in our likes and dislikes and our personalities seem to mend pretty well. Most people wouldn't be friends with someone they have nothing in common with and can't stand their personality.

A recipe for a good friendship has tons of similarities to a recipe for a good romantic partner which is exactly why people tend to develop romantic feelings for someone within the friend group.

I might've worded things bad in my last comment, but I don't go ""I haven't tried a relationship with Mary, let's give her a shot because we work together well as friends"", it's more of being cognizant of the feelings that are organically devolping (or not).

Whether you like it or not, from the very second you meet someone your brain is already trying to figure out where to place them in your hierarchy of relationships. This is constantly being evaluated and adjusted on a per person basis typically based on shared events with said person. Now who do you have the most interactions with, thus the most likelihood of their position being adjusted in your hierarchy? That's right, your friends.

Because of this, there's always an inherent potential of developing feelings for someone within your friend group. Which is why it's pretty ridiculous to verbally aknowledge the disclaimer of ""hey, I don't have feelings for you right now and I may never, but there's always the possibility that someday I might"". Like that is literally the case 100% of the time.","The validity of your point is directly proportional to how honest you are with your intentions. The issue with your stance of ""building friends groups of potential partners"" is are the potential partners willing and consenting participants to your goal of basically trying to find a partner within a friend group ?

Like, people get into relationships with their friends. Shit my friend group's relationship rate is a bit redonk, but we're all nearly 40 and have known each other since high school for the most part, and while some have dated others (repeatedly over the years lol), but there's an honesty there. But when you get into a new friendship - anyone, man or woman - there is usually an undercurrent of wondering on intentions (especially on the women's part) and it's important to be clear in that regard. So many women feel blindsided and manipulated by who they thought were friends, real friends! Who it turns out they wanted more. They never lead them on, gave them any indicator, but because they were friends, they were emotionally open and loving..and a lot of men take this as romantic interest.

So, as one guy to another, I gotta say..your mindset might seem innocent but it genuinely seems like you're getting into friend groups in the hopes of romantic encounters developing, with people who aren't aware of this (but who might suspect it) and that isn't really fair to the people who just want their friends to be friends. Honesty goes a long way my dude.",">They enter into these friendships because they are hoping to pivot it to a romance.

I want to address this a bit. I don't really have an interest in going on random dates with people I don't know, what I prefer is to be friends first before I dedicate time into building a romantic relationship. The reason being is that the likelihood of a romantic relationship working with someone you already know you click with is far more likely (but obviously not impossible) than with a stranger you met or tinder.

So what tends to happen is that I look to friend groups for potential romantic partners. Now this doesn't mean I'm only friends with someone because I may potentially want to date them, I'm genuinely friends with people because at the time, that's all I was interested in. As the friendships build I may or may not want something more.","The issue is too many lads (am guy btw) enter into these relationships facetiously. They enter into these friendships because they are hoping to pivot it to a romance. It's SO horrible. I don't know a single woman who doesn't have an example of a guy who she thought was a friend trying to turn it into something else. Media has a big hand in this with all the romance bullshit and ""she'll love you eventually"" type shite (I'm gonna stop here coz I can rant on this subject for a while lol).

And yeah the adult way, people think it's the end of the world. Too many guys are putting too many eggs in their emotional baskets, and building these fantasies in their heads, only to be absolutely crushed about something that never was! And yeah there's issues about a lack of - emotional I forget the term, when men are lacking in it - but that's not on women either. Women shouldn't need to be on guard all the time worrying if a guy friend is gonna ""fall"" for them because they shown a bit of emotional affection.

Anecdotal as hell and I'm aware of it but I blame young kids not playing more with opposite genders. All lads I know with emotional maturity had girl friends growing up, and have women as actual friends in the friend group. 

(Also Jesus Christ live with women friends for a while. That'll shut that fantasy shit right down. You wanna get a sense of how normal people are live with em for a while lol)","I agree if she doesn’t want a relationship and you do and it’s clear that’s not going to happen best to just kill the relationship all together.

I don’t understand why it’s that difficult to grasp.

 “Sorry, I can’t help but have feelings that move beyond platonic for you so I think it’s best we not pursue any relationship for the time being. Maybe in the future things will be different but for now this is best.

I think it's insecurity and its learned through a culture of misogyny. They are so SO painfully insecure about other men's intentions.

You might believe in 100% of the democratic views, and that’s good for you; but you are one of the few people who are able to say that. I already said before that their stance on abortion is the reason I am not voting for them this year. I believe government should not be involved in medical decision making. 

Overall, democrats believe in more government assistance to the general public and republicans believe in less. That’s the main fundamental difference between the two. From that fundamental difference, I am a republican, because I believe in that fundamental belief.

Progressives need to step up and accomplish much more.","But in both examples you cite regarding Supreme Court Justices the Democrats were powerless, Mitch McConnell was Senate Majority leader and making the arbitrary rules. The hypocrisy was obvious but voters didn't hold him accountable for it and he was reelected. 

There are plenty of things that I believe Democrats would do if given enough representation in Congress while holding the Presidency. Codifying Roe into law for starters, then longer term gains could start to be made on climate change. They could attempt to rebalance the landscape by putting term limits on Justices, granting the option of statehood to Puerto Rico and DC, and electoral college reforms. I think these are the types of things you refer to as what the right does that you say the left isn't willing to do. I think we are at the point that it would get done if the votes were there but we absolutely need more Democrats in Congress to test that theory.

Do I have some ideas as to what should be done? Sure, but they probably aren't very good. Here's the thing. It's not my job, I'm an engineer, not a politician. My complaint is that the people we elect, the people whose job it is to do these things, they aren't good at their jobs. They're making almost no progress. Even Bernie, who I think is the bare minimum of progressive that we need, just hasn't shifted things much. 

If I were as effective in my job as the democrats are, the people who employ me would sit me down and say something like ""hey, you're not really making things that work here, what needs to be done to fix that?"". It's a conversation that needs to be had with politicians. We make too many excuses for why things aren't progressing rather than trying to actually make progress.","I don't necessarily think from a legislative standpoint Trump had that much of an impact. Obviously he was and is terrible for the country and the hateful rhetoric is very damaging, but it's not as though he had that much of a legal impact. The Supreme Court appointees are largely what got us into the mess that started this discussion but 50+ Senators approved each one as well so there's more accountability than just Trump.

You still don't give any actual steps though that Democrats should be taking to create the progress we're looking for.","It cuts both ways. You can't say presidential power is limited and then say trump is fucking everything up (he is, because it isn't nearly as limited as it should be).

Look at all the damage that the recent 3 or 4 Republicans did and compare to the good that the recent 3/4 democrats did. It's completely unbalanced. Pitifully so. Sure we get a sliver of progress every so often (gay marriage... And.. Umm....) but for every one of those, you get a tidal wave of regression.

The worst of it is that progressive ideals and policies would truly help 90% or more of the country, but democrats pursue these things so poorly that a substantial number of people fight it tooth and nail, and a large chunk of people who would be for it are so unenthusiastic about it that they don't give it a second thought.","Presidential power is fairly limited in the grand scheme of things.

The political system being how it is the votes have never been there.

I never loved having to wear makeup but once the pandemic forced us all to work from home and anytime I'd go out I had to wear a mask, I stopped putting it on and just never started back up again.

I grew up with a mother who wouldn't let me out of the house as a teenager if I wasn't wearing makeup. I had bad acne that I wanted to cover up and my mom grew up in the southern USA where being ""presentable"" was absolutely crucial to your social status.

51,"You really clearly don't though - I'm saying that there's a small subset of makeup that is attached to ""partiarchal BS"" and there's other styles that absolutely go against it due to it being viewed as ""excessive"".

That's what I'm talking about - not makeup as a whole, but the styles that inherently clash with the patriarchal desires, workplace standards, and what is considered ""attractive"" by the general male population.

Also, on a note about Hijab - it's empowering in western nations where it would be easier for women to forsake wearing it because wearing it inherently brings judgement upon them from those that dislike muslims/Islam. It places their religion and culture unashamedly in the front of people's minds - it's about their choice and not conforming to what is considered the ""norm"" while embracing their religion.

Everything needs to be taken in context of the situation where the person is, their intentions, and what exactly the ""style"" of what they're doing is - nothing is in a bubble. Wearing makeup in a style that contrasts the ""accepted"" norm results in women being mocked and attempts to enforce them wearing the ""accepted"" styles, as does wearing hijab in areas where that's not considered the norm and there's potentially Islamophobia present.

Fuck judging people for femininity, and fuck judging people for not ""conforming"" to femininity. That's basically my feelings - I don't feel like anyone should be judged or criticised on either side because it just devolves into women tearing down other women because they're ""too feminine"" or ""not feminine enough"". The judgement goes in both ways, it's not just from feminity spaces.","I do understand you. Makeup can be a means for harmless fun or self expression. Its not inherently evil. Its just the patriarchal BS attached to it and enforcing it, mocking women who dont care for it. Online femininity spaces are full of this stuff. Even women treating you poorly just because you dont do performative femininity.","You're not understanding me - there's a range of makeup that is applied, and when you go too far with your use of it (i.e. full glam, alternative makeup, etc.) then it's no longer acceptable.

It's sure as shit a choice to wear alternative or full glam makeup, because you know that there will be plenty of people judging you (both men and women) because it's seen outside the societal norm.","Make up is like hijab, pretty much. It appears as a ""choice"" for some women, but how much of it is actually a choice if your natural face is seen as 'unprofessional', 'ugly' or 'too tired'. Or your workplace enforces it on you but not on men.","Technically if a woman was to show up in full glam makeup at certain workplaces, she may also be fired.

All of this shit depends on the workplace or the male observer - too much makeup is seen as bad, just as no makeup is seen as bad. They're both choices that women can use to express themselves, and aren't necessarily ""conforming"" to the patriarchy.","Then how is makeup feminist and empowering, if its just another tool to oppress women??  Women are treated as aesthetic objects, men are allowed to be themselves.",Employers can legally require women to wear makeup as part of an established dress code; they can impose such restrictions on female employees while not burdening male employees at a similar level.,"Ok?

52,I doubted myself for a bit too. I enjoyed the conversation too so not futile. Have a good'un.,"I’m really sorry! I watched this video previously, and despite going back and seeing this warning, I somehow completely missed it that it was YouTube’s doing. I thought that you were referring to trigger warnings that this creator uses, without actually understanding you. 

This argument has been futile and my fault! :(","I was reading it as the video had been slapped with these warnings by YouTube, who were basically saying that the content may be false and may mislead the viewer in some way that would have a negative impact on society.

It may be that these content warnings were in fact general trigger warnings that were added by the creator with positive intent.

If it is the latter I retract my previous criticisms, but looking at it again it does seem to be something YouTube has added to ward people away as if the video is going to e.g. incite hatred or violence.

You then get into the query of is this similar to censorship or is it more similar to a general age rating as you might see for all movies.","I think you’re wrong about content warning being about information, but I’m not 100% sure what it is. Here are two options:

1. Content warnings means that the medium features content that may be triggering, such as Abuse, Murder, Substance use. Trigger warning is about the discussion of such, without necessarily featuring content. For example, I could have triggered a classmate while talking about abortion, without actually featuring pictures, videos, recordings, written experience of abortion. I should put a trigger warning. If I do have any of these, i should’ve used a content warning for abortion. 

2. Content warning is about a medium featuring content that elicits strong negative emotions, such as abuse, murder, substance use. Trigger warning is about a medium featuring content that might elicit a traumatic response in someone. If my discussion includes depiction of excessively harsh criticism, and a classmate has traumatic responses from experiencing excessively harsh criticism, I should have a trigger warning, but not a content warning. I should have a content warning if I depict or mention something that will make most people very uncomfortable. Think Gordon Ramsey calling a cook stupid and him freezing/crying because of childhood trauma

So when a video contains hate-speech, a content warning would mean “this video will contain depiction of hatespeech and not just mention it” or “I think that most if not all of my audience find the hate speech that I will depict as disturbing, instead of eliciting a traumatic response in only a small part of the audience”","Yeh. So this video seemed to have one that basically said ""be careful with the information in this video, it may be false"". That is absolutely ridiculous for this specific video.

The ones that say ""this video touches on topics that may trigger xyz"" are a good thing.",Aah. I think I got you now,"Regarding content warnings: More or less I have no idea, but different ones.

this image is both HILARIOUS and horrifying","Hahah, this is so insane! You're not wrong in that he's got the mindset of a teenager. The fact that he's insecure about the size of a toy designed for external stimulation is just so ridiculous to me. In what way would they compare, Adam?! Do you jiggly your dick on her clit violently in the same manner that a clit-stim toy does?  

OP, you have EVERY RIGHT to be mad and your response thus far is completely normal and justified. He's the one being a little bitch about everything. The fact that he views you as a living fleshlight during sex is so horrendously disrespectful.",I just bought the wand a couple of weeks ago and tried it on a couple of times when I was alone. I used it for the first time when the two of us were together a few days ago. I think he noticed that the wand is way bigger than his penis and so he got nervous.,">He then angrily asked me if my climaxing was just as important as his, and I replied by saying yes,

This question alone shows that he doesn't consider you sexual equals. He clearly doesn't consider you climaxing to be as important as him climaxing.

>He was initially fine with me using the bullet in bed earlier. A few days ago, I began using the wand and he just stopped and looked at me with a confused stare. I

Did something happen a few days ago or have you never used the wand in bed before? I don't understand why he would suddenly go from accepting your need to have clitoral stimulation to not accepting it."
54,"And why does he insist on living at his mothers house, if her actions bother him?","He eats her head off too. He can go weeks without speaking to her. He ignores her on the daily. It’s like we live there with her but not all that present. We do our own little things. His lack of a healthy relationship with his mom affected me in the past because I wondered if he would refuse to build a connection with my mom because of it. It’s super important in my family that we’re all close and happy and spend time together. He isn’t treated like a “son-in-law”, he’s treated like my parents own kid. The love and respect he receives at my place is not to be found at his.","What does your husband say when your MIL says racist things about you? This makes my blood boil. If any of my family members or friends said racist things about my SO, heads would roll.","I love him and I want this to work on the long run. But it deeply hurts that I don’t know how to be the bubbly person I once was. And now my grandma is deteriorating but the one person I want to go with me, refuses just the idea of traveling to my country. Fuck. 

I know all the answers lead to I’m unhappy. AND I AM but fuck I just want to be happy with him again. I want to live life with him. I want to do things with him. I can always do it solo but I want to WITH him, and that’s my downfall. 

I know I’m being frustrating because the answers ARE THERE but I can’t help but want things my husband doesn’t. 

I’m just feeling a lot and needed a safe place to let it out. I’m so sad.","Honey you literally just said several paragraphs about why it’s not just about travel.  

It’s not.  His unwillingness to travel a symptom of his larger attitude towards you, your culture and your race.  


There’s nothing wrong with YOU.","I think it is. But I also wish he’d spend more time with my family. Like actually learning them and being present in their lives. 

I try to build a bond with his mom all the time. She’s super mean to me when he’s at work and I’m home. I usually have to spend my free time outdoors to avoid her. I only tell him a few things at a time because I know his relationship is already so bad with his mom. 

I try not to make it worse but I’m living in hell with him just so I could be near him. 

I feel like I’m dying in order to be loved. My family means EVERYTHING to me; yet I left my comfy home to spend our marriage at his place. 

Why can’t he come and stay with my family while saving for money? It’s not like we had a traditional marriage. I stay with my family almost every other weekend. If I can handle his moms racism, why can’t he handle my family? We’re just a bit loud and have more fun at home. 

It’s the little things that have become big because I don’t see him trying for my family but I try everyday to be accepted by his mom. 

I have to hear about my dark complexion, what I can wear or not wear because “bright colors don’t look good on dark skin and dark colors also don’t look good on dark skin” 

I’m considered white in my south Asian community. I’m considered almost sickenly pale. Yet I’m getting told on the daily that I shouldn’t wear this or that. 

I try so hard to be accepted when he isn’t home. Or when he is home. I’ve just recently stopped trying because NOW when I look in the mirror, I see myself as dark and now I have an issue with it too. 

I’ve never been a colorist in 27 years of my life. Now when I lay on his chest, I’ll tell him “wow, I’ve really gotten dark” 

Fuck, it makes me cry just recalling this from the other day. Like I actually told my husband “my arm did get dark huh” 

Why have I become so disgusting.","Bare minimum doesn’t sound “great” to me. 

The problem isn’t about just the travel, is it?","In other ways.. everyday things are pretty nice. He makes sure we get to have our date nights, he’s more emotionally present and physically present when he isn’t working and home. He spends more time with me, he tries to meet my physical needs. I acknowledge all the little things he’s done for me. 

It’s just.. it’s bare minimum.. so I’m left feeling like the things I ask for more—aren’t being met. 

I’m sure he’s probably feeling discredited and misunderstood. I’m sure he has complaints about me too; but I just feel like I’m so giving and out there and I wish he’d meet me halfway."

56,"That’s why twitter calls it “deactivation”, not “deletion”. Deactivating your account will not be subject to the 14 days GDPR law because it’s not technically “deleting” your account. 

In order for Twitter to actually remove all of your data from its databases you have to (a) be a citizen requesting from an EU country and (b) actually ask their customer support to delete everything.

If twitter doesn't pledge to be deleting all user data when an account is requested to be deleted within I believe it's 14 days then it is not legal for them to operate in any EU territory and they can face a fine worth I think it's like 10% of their yearly earnings plus whatever other damages the EU court decides.

Just deactivate the account. EU law mandates that all personal data is deleted within a certain amount of time after account deletion.,"This is not true. You have to delete all your tweets otherwise your data is still there. There are 3rd party bots that do it for you because the only way to delete tweets is individually.

Eventually it mentioned “deactivating” the account, but I’m not sure if that’s the same as deleting it.","Nah I did this same thing a few days ago aswell.

69,"Uh, she's 2 1/2. 

 I'm more concerned with messages she's receiving about beauty standards, and about how beauty is still pretty central to the lives of young girls, and what society expects from girls. 

Obviously you are not the mother of daughters so you're comparing the kids you had in your class to mine, and I don't think it's really relevant right now.",I didn’t say that everything is solved. There’s a bigger picture I am looking at here. What are you going to communicate to your daughter about domestic labor (or communicate to young women in general)? That she should just accept it or that it’s worth pushing back on and not something she is required to do just because she’s a girl?,">more households where the woman is the breadwinner

But if covid showed up anything, it's that women are still doing the ""second shift"" when they get home, and still hitting the glass ceiling at work.

We'll agree to disagree here.","I think it does, because it means a lot more kids and young people are questioning the gender binary, which means they are open to questioning what it even means to be male or female which has largely been a social construct, which is kind of wonderful. I didn’t even know what gender non binary was until a friend (previously female identifying) came out as they/them to me a few years ago. I think it does help cis women, because it directly challenges what the patriarchy is holding up about gender norms, and basically is an f you to this system. It’s brave for people to come out as non binary, and it’s the first time gender as a social construct has entered the mainstream, and it does help us.

Yes, there is still sexism, but besides gender fluidity there are things that are changing. There’s more women who are college educated, more households where the woman is the breadwinner (https://www.americanprogress.org/article/breadwinning-mothers-critical-familys-economic-security/), more kids with openly gay parents which, more people coming out as trans and non binary (which you may or may not know about a kid for years), more people seeking treatment for their mental health, more women living their lives on their own and on their own terms. There are more movies and shows directed by women, and this has been awesome because we consume media. Yes, there are still bad things. My point, is it’s also good to acknowledge the positive changes, because the more we celebrate these changes the more positive impact we have on the world. If we only focus on what is worse, then what does this tell young women? It takes away their power in the world. It’s awful Roe was overturned, but there are still more of us that support roe it than not. If we want to push back and keep moving forward, we have to acknowledge the progress and continue to push progress. Otherwise, we are giving up, and yes, we could lose more rights. But, it’s not inevitable if we focus on how we want to shape the world and realize there are many like minded people, who are perhaps, the majority.","Okay, I'll give you that. But I don't really think that the fluidity of transgendered or binary youth really has much impact on cis-girls. Cis-girls and women don't suffer any less sexism than they did before. For them, things are very much the same, and sometimes, a bit worse.","I would say, for one thing, that are understanding of gender is changing, and this is the big, relevant change of what it even means to be a girl or boy in society. They/them is very common and accepted with young people and even kids, and kids are pretty willing to challenge gender norms in ways that didn’t exist before. There’s much more fluidity around gender than there used to be. 

I would also say there’s more acceptance and awareness of mental health and diverging from being neurotypical. So a lot of young people I have worked with are very good at talking about their struggles. This doesn’t mean they’d not have struggles, but it’s not stuffed down like it was a a generation or so ago. This has been my experience working with gen z. I also have a teenage stepson. The most popular kid in my stepson’s middle school was a girl that came out as gender non binary went by they/them and had cool style. It had nothing to do with looks. This is a big change, and would have been unheard of in the 90s or early 2000s. Gender non binary did not exist. 

I’m not saying it’s all better. We don’t live in a utopia or equal society. That being said, I am saying our understanding and attitudes towards gender are changing, especially among young people who, frankly, are leading the way on this, and that absolutely has an impact on how kids are expressing themselves. With parents who are supportive, usually, it’s good and positive.","How are things truly different for girls?

Sure, body and fat shaming is less prevalent, but it still happens. I wasn't pressured to send nude pictures to boys when I was growing up though, and I didn't have to contend with boys watching porn the way they do now in lieu of a sex education. Rampant sexism was going on when I was growing up, but music gave women a lot of power, and the freedom to be exactly what they wanted to be. Remember the Lilith Faire? There was a certain message about the 90's that I don't really see much today: *It's wonderful to be a woman. Celebrate your womanhood.*

I honestly can't really see how things are better today than they were then. I will say that teachers and parents are less tolerant of that shit than they were when I was growing up, but that's because it's *we* who have changed, not really kids.

I guess it all depends on what constitutes a good role model.....but I didn't say there weren't any, I just said there were few. And I really do believe that.","I don’t disagree there are problems for girls. I’m pointing out that there’s been changes, and things are different. That doesn’t negate any issues. I just think it’s worth considering what progress there has been, and that kids are a bit different than when we grew up (assuming you are a millennial). I definitely don’t think all issues have been solved for girls. That would be nuts.

I disagree there aren’t role models though."
70,"Not heated at all, and the psychiatrist I gathered earlier.  Good luck and be well","i appreciate it as well! while self esteem *can* be indicative of how successful someone will be in life it's actually one of the more shaky ways to determine their success. personality theorists see incongruence between who one is and who one wants to be as a more solid indicator for distress and other similar issues in life. This is where i really think gender roles can hurt people, like you said with your point on nature vs nurture and how they could be passed down by parents. A child who's raised to be a girl that doesn't want to be a ""girl"" (in the context of feminine stereotypes) would probably show a greater incongruence between who she is/pressured by her family to be rather than who she wants to be and that's where you'd see more insecurities or, on the other side, more acting out. (Acting out is seen more with authoritarian or negligent parents) 

It's also definately frustrating to see it take it's toll on others you know.

Though self esteem can be built back up, you're right that it's incredibly difficult to climb out of those types of thinking. With therapy and psychiatry, many times it's not an option that many people can afford or just would be too embarrassed about attending due to how stigmatized it is. There's an incredibly large multitude of factors at play with situations like this and it really depends on the specific situations that lead to seeking out abusive partners, knowingly or otherwise. 

If any of this comes off as heated i assure you I don't mean for it to, i just got out of classes so I'm a little fried, also if you want me to clarify anything please ask, I'm studying to be a psychiatrist and love talking about personality theory and child development/psychology","“Loser magnets” are the ladies who say “why do I always go out with losers” as you saw it wasn’t an insult. I also agree that a woman who’s never been in that type of relationship ends up with that personality trait. It’s either a family member talking down to (or at) her or radiating off a parent who’s witnessed it in their parent, I don’t know exactly. I will say it’s way to common and until there’s some way to teach self-esteem it won’t get better, unfortunately. But how, I think that comes from your own successes, win at sports get more confidence playing, same with exams at school, but I hated to see it in some of my daughters friends. I appreciate the dialogue","I'd say you're right that self esteem plays into it, i see it as the result of a self fulfilling prophecy wherein the women who you so hilariously put as 'loser magnets' are that way because they believe they can't do any better. what interests me is what causes women who're neurotypical and haven't gone through trauma/psychological programming by an abuser, to develop that sense of themselves and when it takes form. Gender norms seem very pervasive with younger girls, which reminds me of this really great video essay I watched about the book titled 'the care and keeping of you' and how that book used to perpetuate ideas about dressing modestly and that it's not okay to discuss puberty and going through it (for girls of course.) 

All this to say that i think you hit the nail on the head and that I believe part of that insecurity for women who hadn't already had it programmed into them is caused by how heavily parents or caregivers adhere to gender roles.

 I think the idea of the ought self and the actual self also definately go hand in hand with this but i digress- I'd be happy to try (to the best of my half completed psych degree) to explain those a little more, it's really interesting stuff!","Thank you, your thoughts if you don't mind.","This is an interesting comment, I'm just commenting as a bookmark to see how the discussion goes when more people reply!","Interesting you say that and here’s a theory of mine.  I’ve always said the most attractive trait any woman can have is self-esteem or self-confidence. Most real men are not afraid of a successful, intelligent woman but they are attracted to them where insecure “men” or I’ll say abusive guys avoid them. A woman with little to no self-esteem in fact are loser magnets (is that too harsh?). In that situation the guy sees a woman who won’t question him, when asked “where do you want to go eat?” will say wherever you want is fine, what movie “whatever you want to see” etc. which for that guy is great until it’s not. At some point that does get old and that’s when he changes and isn’t nice any longer, now it’s “can’t you make a choice?” “Why am I always deciding, can’t you make an F’in decision?” etc. and it gets worse from there, I believe that’s why so often it’s “he was so nice when we started dating then he changed….”.  So a confident woman attract confident men.  Any replies either agree or disagree?",It really is. What you’ll find though is men do exist who value strong women. And the reality is those guys still were formed within and live in a culture that is misogynistic AF so they won’t always get it right - but when you call them on their shit they’ll listen and learn.

Republican candidates continue to spread rumors about voter fraud in attempts to delegitamize any candidates they don't agree with, while conservative state legislatures try to make voting more difficult.

75,">So no, it’s not whataboutism by any definition to talk about violence against women and girls (which btw is not the same thing as violence against AFAB people - violence against AFAB people includes trans men, and VAWG includes trans women, which you seem to be conveniently forgetting in your haste to turn this into two groups competing with each other…). 

You were specifically talking about violence against **AFAB** people

>to women (and enbies) who are **AFAB**

I said that it isn't because someone is AFAB vs AMAB

>I think it's less of an AMAB vs AFAB thing
 
You were the one pitting AFAB vs AMAB (a line of distinction that I, as a non-binary person myself, hate). You were the one who in response to a trans* person turned around and said that AFAB people have it worse. It's no different than those men who turn around and bring up how bad male suicide statistics are, but only in response to people commiserating about misogyny. Which is especially egregious when statistics show that ""women who are AFAB"" don't actually experience violence ""more so"" than trans people (once again, including non-binary people such as OP) of **either** AGAB.

Look, I'm going to stop replying here. All you're doing is flipping an uno reverse card and going ""no u"" on the bits that I'm calling out.

EDIT: and I've been blocked","um, the post also says that OP *now understands what women experience* in terms of harassment and violence.

This is a lot more complicated than you think it is, and actually unpicking the nuances and challenging some of the assumptions here is a necessary and important thing to do. Shutting down discussion and trying to make people compete with each other in the way you are attempting to push for is incredibly unhealthy. Literally nothing in my comments is anything but supportive of the OP, and it’s possible to be supportive *alongside* engaging in a wider discourse. You do not have an absolute right to set the terms of discussion here.

eta: tbh if anyone is dismissive, it’s you.","Both things are bad, **but** you were the one who said that people are more aggressive to AFAB people on a post about a non-binary person who was AMAB, in a reply to a comment talking about how people are particularly awful to AMAB people who don't conform to such an assumption.

Further you posted a link talking about violence against women, and yes, compared to men women are much more likely to be a victim of violence. However, OP is not a man, nor were the groups addressed in the comment you replied to (with the exception of femboys, but them being men is secondary to the point being made). I brought up statistics of violence against trans people because non-binary people are definitionally also transgender (with some very rare exceptions where a person may be intersex **and** also raised as such).

76,"I'm not saying that it's the individual's responsibility to change. I'm well aware of late stage capitalism and the hellscape that it creates. What I'm saying is that it's unfair to expect women to bring home half of the income *and* do the vast majority of the emotional and domestic labor. Which is exactly what I said.

Yes, I do think if men did the majority of the domestic and emotional labor, then it would very much be viewed differently. What a silly question. Of course it would. Everything that gets pushed off on women is devalued and given less importance in the heterosexual relationship ""exchange.""","If I'm understanding correctly, in your opinion it's essentially less about the degree or salary itself and more about the assumed contributions to the relationship based on past experience and statistical averages? So if for example a potential partner made less money than you but did the majority of the household work and wasn't an emotional burden, that would be a ""fair trade"" (assuming of course that less income = less hours at work, which isn't a guarantee in the current economy)?

>also expected to have a full-time job and provide half the income

This is probably the only thing you listed that isn't directly the responsibility of individuals to change. Time was, a single minimum wage job could support two adults and multiple children. Thanks late-stage capitalism and wage stagnation!","Because women already do vastly disproportionally more of the emotional and domestic labor in heterosexual relationships and then, on top of that, are also expected to have a full-time job and provide half the income. So, coupling down can be seen as really doing a great disservice to a woman's worth. Why even bother saddling yourself with the burden of a ""partner"" when you're the one bringing literally everything to the table?","You're right, college graduates in the US are 60/40 female/male, with the ratio trending female more and more every year.

I asked the person you replied to this, but I'll ask you as well: why is ""dating down"" seen as a bad thing for women?","> Women often feel the need to date someone less successful than them or get lost in the dating pool.

That's just a statistics though.

If we limit to something easily measurable like educational achievement then women are the majority of students in tertiary education in (I'm fairly certain) practically every western country.   
In my country the disparity is 2 to 1, in the US it's what, 3 to 2? Something like that.

For the swiping era of online dating, I don't know what they do if you delete the app without deleting your profile - if you even can delete your profile. I know on at least one app I had to make a new profile after deleting the app and later reinstalling it. I also know that on the apps where they don't limit how many folks you can ""like"" per day, there are people who like absoutely everyone without exception, just in case. I'm sure many of my matches fall into that category. I don't know about needing to be a member to message on the mainstream/popular apps but they are always hawking the paid version. The point is, (it feels like) plenty of peope have success despite all these things so it gets really depressing.","This is very much the case. They need to appear to be active and have lots of people who are in the action. So they use tons of bots and fake profiles.

And always push for that golden subscription.","I am not sure the current situation in dating apps so maybe this has changed. But 10 years ago when I was doing this as a male on the big dating site of the time it turned out that a lot of women on the site were not members and thus could not respond. Then when I quit the service myself, they kept my profile up even though I cancelled. The only thing I was able to do to keep them from putting my profile up when I was not part of the service was to physically delete the pictures, text etc. Why did they do this? Well I would get e mails from them saying someone replied to my profile. I could look at the response and profile but if I wished to respond I had to become a paying member. But back then, I know from my personal profile, they are putting profiles up that are NOT part of the service. They did it repeatedly with mine.

Sooo it would not surprise me if some of the profiles people are looking at, responding to may not be real, or be able to respond (as I said, haven't done online dating lately maybe it has changed). So I was sending out all these e mails getting no responses back, taking a hit to the ego in the process. Yet I have no idea how many of those folks were actually still on the service and could have replied if they wanted. But the ego took a hit none the less. Something to consider if getting no response if they still play these games.","Thank you for this. I feel so seen because emphatic disinterest is the most apt description of online dating I've ever heard.  For context, I am a woman and I live in a medium-big city, on the East Coast.

I get matches on any app/site I use, but I get very few messages and no one ever responds if I intiate. I have friends who will only use Bumble, the App where only women can initiate,  due to perceptions of safety, but I've never ever had someone I reached out to on Bumble respond so I deleted it.

It doesn't matter if I say something low effort like ""Hey, how are you?"" or actually put in effort to say something witty/interesting/flirty.  People don't respond me. That's not to say that I've never had a reply when I initiated but of all the dates/relationships I've had from dating sites, it's probably 90 percent they reached out and 10 percent I reached out. And people don't initiate very often either. I don't know why there is so little interest in me but it definitely is depressing. Sorry, this is not directly related to OP but your wording rang so true to me.","I can sort of relate? I'm a guy so the dynamics at play are quite different. But when you do the online dating thing and get met with emphatic disinterest in you, its hard not to internalize that sometimes and make you feel like there's something wrong with you. People sometimes try and give you advice and tell you to revise that profile or that your picture sucks (which can hit hard when its a normal every day picture of you that is really an honest representation of what you look like) ,  but after putting all that effort in and still zero interest it can hit you even worse.  


Then sometimes someone will hit you back and normally you would realize this person is absolutely not for you and are actually kind of awful. But then you put up with them making some pretty insulting jokes at your expense and you find yourself trying not to confront them about things they say that you object to because they were willing to at least give you some attention and you don't want to rock the boat."

Black men will never learn if white women keep dating them.","If a guy said to me ""I don't date Black women because they are Black women"", I wouldn't date him. But if he never brings it up, and otherwise acts normal, and never makes any racist comments, how am I supposed to know? That doesn't mean I'm ""playing into it"".","I agree. I’m black, through research I’ve discovered only 30% of black women get married. It’s because of the racism. Most black men don’t want black women, they want white or anyone besides black women. White men only want white or any other race than black women. All other races go for the same. The Midwest sucks for dating. I’m filtered out of dating apps because the men only want white women. White women play into it because they date these racist men. 

Religion is also a problem. Racism is a lot higher amongst white Christians than the non religious.

I’m planning to move south next year, I hear dating is a lot better down there."
81,"I think you really need to study some Chinese history to see what the state did in response to religion to make those claims. The CCP were brutal in excising religion from the culture. It wasn't perfect but it was ruthless and extreme.

To suggest that the patriarchy of China is solely about religion while ignoring the atheist, communist ideals of what men and women should do seems illogical and unreasonable.

Finally, Confucianism being based on Confucius as a religion is true. But Confucius himself was raised in a patriarchal society. Religions don't create the patriarchy, they're just sometimes tools to help enforce it. So are non-religious ideas. Thinking the removal of religion would fix anything is foolish, look at China or NK or the Soviets.","> And yet they threw it away and maintain patriarchal positions. 

They didn't completely ""throw it away"". You can't just erase thousands of years of cultural conditioning overnight, no matter how much the CCP tries.

Non-patriarchal religions like Wicca were never in power in most places (especially so post-colonialism, when patriarchal societies steamrolled everyone globally) so they're irrelevant for this argument","And yet they threw it away and maintain patriarchal positions. The point again being that religion is not needed to enforce the patriarchy.

There are plenty of non-patriarchal religions too, like Wicca.",">  Nobody would put China ahead of the UK for being less patriarchal, would they?

China also has thousands of years of Confucianism (and it's included misogyny) influencing their culture, and cultures across East Asia. Confucianism was a state religion for thousands of years, and just because it's no longer an official religion doesn't mean there isn't that patriarchal baggage left over.

Point is the vast majority of the time if there is a patriarchy, you can usually identify religion as a root cause enforcing it.","That doesn't really bear out in reality. Atheist nations are sometimes much worse than religious ones, because the patriarchy has different tools to maintain itself. Nobody would put China ahead of the UK for being less patriarchal, would they?",Yet even more so when pushed by religions. Let’s not pretend that’s not true.,"Incels are found in all cultures, not just religious ones. The patriarchy sits quite happily with the non-religious too.","> People should prob stop raising their kids to believe this.

We're trying. The biggest problem is that too many men are raised in religious households that indoctrinate them in patriarchy. They're told that ""men have to take care of the women,"" thus creating the ""nice guy"" who feels entitled to women just because he'll be a ""protector"" and ""provider."""

85,"yes, and what do you think is going to happen in therapy besides “men, just stop?” i’ve already offered other solutions and i can give you many more besides what you’re saying which is, “men, just go to therapy”","Therapy is not a cure all for anything.

Its not a cure all for drug addiction. Its not a cure all for mental health. Its not going to be a cure all for men that hate women for whatever motive they may have. 

But it is the best we've got. Therapy is also for a lot more than literal mental illness. ""Men, Just stop"" is never going to work. We have to make them.","it’s coddling that we suggest them going to therapy is all they need when people have no idea the slightest amount of what actually happens in therapy. if you go in and say “i’m lonely,” well the therapist is going to just suggest you meetups and activities to go to, where the man can then harass women there with professional approval. the therapist will not figure this out until a couple years into it, because it takes time to dig through the surface at the inner issues. we could have been raising men differently this entire time instead of wasting time and resources on people who have no intent on becoming better and hardly see women as people. 

for example, mass murders are an incel related problem. this is not cured by therapy. it’s also multi faceted. men who feel entitled to womens bodies do not have a mental illness or any kind of emotional distress. they are simply frustrated that they can’t demand sex and have women fall at their feet.

suggesting therapy is also problematic because it suggests these men have a mental health issue. this is far from it. they are usually very privileged and live comfortable lives. they are fully capable of changing their mindset on their own, to stop watching misogynistic men on youtube, to stop laughing at rape jokes, to stop blaming women for all of their problems. they choose not to.

inb4 “therapy is for everyone”, no it’s really not. if you go in there with no actual pressing issues, you will just stare at each other for 45 minutes. learned this the hard way.","Not trying to makes leaps, I just really don't understand what you want. I don't think you actually want less men in therapy, that's just what it sounds like. ""Men need to fix it"" is not an actionable solution so I can only base what I think you think the solution is on the fact you are claiming therapy to be a solution by women and therefore a bad option.

Destigmatizing therapy IS the societal solution.

Therapy is not coddling, as you mention it is hard work and requires active effort to change yourself.","you’re making a lot of leaps about what i’m saying. individual people going to therapy is great. but suggesting every man in current society enrolling in therapy will fix the problem is insane. it’s clearly not a personal issue. and when you treat a societal issue like that, you make the societal solution women, again, in a different setting. i’ve been going to therapy for years. i know the kind of work they do. if you do not actually want to change, you won’t change. it’s hard work. its exhausting. i highly doubt these types of people are willing to put in the effort. stop coddling them.","So, your argument is therapy wont work?

Therapy actually is ""them working it out themselves"". People go to therapy to work on themselves. Going to a therapist isnt nonconsensual, male or female they can turn down any patient they want. 

Youre also making it out like these are convicted felons. These are guys who think they are lonely and want to figure out why. The therapist will tell them their want for a partner is a deflection from why they are actually unhappy. Therapy ensues.","not what i was saying at all. but putting dangerous men in a close setting with women is a bad idea, and also just reinforces their belief that women are there as tools for them to use to feel better. the long term solution is that men stop feeling so goddamn entitled to womens bodies and time. they need to get used to it. this stuff is not only caused by porn, the media, their fathers, but also encouraged and shared by men among each other. nothing women say will change their perception of women. they need to work it out themselves.","Thats the short term solution but doesnt tackle the cause. We also need long term solutions.

Your solution is like having soup kitchens but no effort to create affordable housing. Sure, you're saving lives now, but youre really just surviving while maintaining the status quo. 

And in no instance does anyone that knows anything about mental healthcare think the actions of a patient are the fault of the therapist."
86,"Whataboutism is not a good argument. Especially when you're on reddit, which is also doing the same shit.

That's the reality. Being angry over Twitter doesn't change anything. If everyone leaves Twitter it will become just like Tumblr, a hollow shell of it's former userbase, or vine and just shut down, all the while 4chan is the one still producing white supremacist propaganda to feed 13 and 14 year old boys.

88,"The early Romans believed that a good woman was a woman who did nothing noteworthy, except to honor her male relatives and her family’s lineage.

Lucretia is held up as an example of a virtuous woman because she “allowed” a man to rape her when he said he was going to kill her and a male slave in he bed as if he caught her in the act of adultery. She would rather be raped than shame her husband by being accused of being adulterous. After the rape, she called her husband and father to her, “confessed” to being raped (it was seen as the woman’s fault, no matter what) and then killed herself to preserve her family’s lineage and honor.

Roman women didn’t even have real names. Each daughter was given the feminized version of her father’s name. If there were more than one daughter, they would be named Julia Major (older daughter of Julius) and Julia Minor (younger daughter of Julia).",Thanks for the rec! The Aeneid thus far has treated the women characters as mere convenient plot devices. Some truly WTF moments.,"After you finish The Aeneid, you should read Lavinia by Ursula K. Le Guin. It takes a basically wordless woman in The Aeneid who plays a key role as Aeneas's wife and gives her a voice and agency and really beautifully fleshes out who Lavinia was to the story.","I read Song of Achilles before Circe, and it was, as you said, very helpful. And so good too! I'm reading The Aeneid right now so I'm getting bits of the whole Trojan War saga from all these different works. May I recommend Stephen Fry's Great Mythology series, beginning with Mythos? Listen to the audiobooks, if possible. Fry has such a lovely enthusiastic way of telling the story. 

I haven't read Eleanor Oliphant, but will look for it! I liked Piranesi, but not sure I really ""got"" it.","If you havent read Song of Achilles yet, please do so. Same author and style, and reading Circe first gives you some between the lines character building of Achilles' mother, which touches on the themes in this thread. So damn good. (Random shout outs to Piranesi and Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, just cause we're dumping good books we read this year).",Circe was so good.

89,">I knew a woman who adored babies, but lost interest once they could speak.

That might be a woman who simply can't stand toddlers, I know they can be very difficult, but it also reeks of narcissistic mother to me - likes infants she can dress up like dolls and use as extensions of herself, but no longer likes the child once they're able to form and express preferences that might differ from hers.","Thanks for doing that! There’s so many cool subreddits out there; hopefully someone knows of some data. 

I do love a good tangent. ❤️  I could see communal childcare reducing the need to opt out of getting pregnant/having a child. If there’s a community of women who love kids at different developmental stages, you could stay involved in a way that suits your temperament. (e.g. I knew a woman who adored babies, but lost interest once they could speak. Not a great situation if you live in a nuclear family setup, but much less harmful to the kids if she had been living in a more traditional community).",I thought this was such a great question I asked it in r/AskHistorians because Google Scholar and JSTOR didn't have good options despite using several different keyword combinations. I know a smidge about infertile women in BaManianga society but because having children was part of how you became an ancestor I can't conceive of a woman admitting openly to not wanting children. Second wives were a not uncommon strategy if the couple was infertile but a lot of childcare was communal and the wives lived together away from the husband so I'd imagine there was high involvement even on the side of the infertile first wife. Obviously super tangential to your question!,"I wanted to add that I find it interesting that there’s not a lot of discussion about First Nations women who didn’t want to have children.

98,"Yeah I guess I’m team “communication first, then maybe nuke it” and you’re team “nuke it if they don’t meet every single one of your undisclosed expectations”

Agree to disagree for sure","You can set your own standards, that's fine. But in my experience, setting higher standards gets you a better, more considerate partner. So I will always advise women to leave if they aren't being considered. Feel free to not follow that advice.","If I was in a relationship and someone got me a Christmas present I didn’t ask for or even allude to wanting and I showed appreciation, but didn’t get them anything and then got broken up with immediately without discussion, I’d think that person was nuts.

I’d never do this, but if I *said* I’d get something for them and then didn’t, I’d be more understanding if they wanted to end things immediately, but I’d still think an immediate break up without discussion would be a drastic move.

There are plenty of fish in the sea, and women have historically been taken for granted when it comes to hetero relationships, but what I see now is a lot of people over-correcting and just sifting through men until they find the perfect man that does the perfect things.. and I just think that’s so silly because no one is perfect and if you expect your man to know all the “rules” of common courtesy and won’t sacrifice a second of your time to discuss your expectations, you better be fucking perfect, too",No. I don't think you should ever have to ask for common courtesy. I refuse to ask people for basic consideration. There are better fish in the sea.,"Yes, but there was a key thing you said there: “keep asking for common courtesy”.. I personally am just waiting for OP to say explicitly that she has had a conversation with her SO.

She says this has been happening for two years and she said he said he doesn’t celebrate Valentine’s Day (but I wasn’t under the impression that the topic of the gift giving empty promises is what led to him saying that.. I took it as them speaking generally about that particular holiday.. I could be wrong though of course) and then she said she’s just not going to get him a gift anymore..

She never said she that in two years she’s ever actually had a conversation with him about this thing that clearly bothers her.. maybe she did, but I don’t like filling in contextual details in order to form an opinion.. I’m very curious to know what he’s said when she really brings it up.. if she has..

People are going to walk all over you if you let them.. and if it turns out that OP just kept expecting her SO to spontaneously change without having a real conversation, I have no issue putting some of the blame on her for not standing up for herself.. hints and passive aggressive huffs and puffs doesn’t translate (which I know is a huge assumption there - I’m just giving a generally example).. but yeah, if you’re in a relationship for two years and don’t feel comfortable being straight up and having a conversation or just otherwise letting something like this go on for two years without explicitly discussing what your expectations are, that’s not completely on the SO..

All that said, IF it turns out OP has in fact been continuously “asking for common courtesy”, I’m 100% with you and the majority of the people in these comments..

And actually, I’m not even an advocate for second chances honestly.. setting a boundary one time should be enough.. if they care, they only need to hear it once and there are plenty of potential partners out there who “only need to hear it once”.. I feel like a lot of people are taking what I say as “be patient and lenient on men because they don’t know better” which is not my sentiment at all, but people are responding to me like that’s what I’m saying.. I am literally just saying: “step 1. say something”

Am I assuming she hasn’t said anything yet? More like, she didn’t say she said anything so I am taking that as she didn’t say anything.","I think the opposite - people take yellow flags and don't have the proper caution, and that's how they end up in relationships like the one OP describes, where their partner fails to show up time and time again. I've dated too many people like that to even give them a chance - and then I ended up with a great guy who *doesn't* drop the ball. It's better to be selective than having to keep asking for common courtesy, imo.","I mean, I guess we’re all just different, but if I were in this situation, it would clearly be an issue (if he wasn’t giving presents, but I was), but it’s no where near deal breaker territory for me.. especially if I haven’t even had a conversation about it first.

I posted another long winded reply elsewhere, but I just think the yellow flags in a relationship are worth a conversation before jumping ship, because people just think differently and prioritize differently.. my sister once blew up at me for something I didn’t see coming one bit.. it was just a blind spot for me.. off the record: I still don’t quite understand why it was a big deal or how she even cared to put so much energy into being bothered about it, but guess what? I didn’t say any of that stuff to her, because whatever her reasons, it clearly bothered her and I care about her and that was enough for me to care about this thing that bothered her and be more attentive to it.. I think the “you can’t change people” is taken too literally and rigidly..

Additionally.. the other side to this is determining.. hey, is this a yellow flag? or is it an incompatibility? If it were me, I’d be on the other side of this.. I *hate* giving/receiving gifts.. the only difference between me and this guy is that I would never say I’m gonna give someone a gift in the first place.. if he got me a gift, I’d say “ohh you didn’t have to do that! Aw, thank you! I feel terrible I didn’t get you anything” and that’d be the end of it.. if that happened several more times, honestly, I’d be as uncomfortable as he felt slighted, like.. he’d think “why isn’t she getting the hint that she should be getting me gifts” and I’d think “why isn’t he getting the hint that I don’t do gifts”.. that’d be an indication of incompatibility.. then if we have to have a conversation, depending on how compatible we are in the other areas, if he really expressed that he’d appreciate more gifts, I’d absolutely give in without question.. but if he says “oh, I was just doing it because I thought you were supposed to but if you really don’t care about gifts, giving or receiving, then we don’t have to do that”, that’d be even better

Honestly, I only like giving gifts if I know the person is going to like it.. like if there is something I know he’s been eyeing for a while and a special occasion is coming up, I’d definitely get it.. if a special occasion wasn’t coming up, I’d just get it as soon as I could if it was something I could afford readily.. gifts for the sake of gifts straight up makes me nauseous and gives me anxiety, giving and receiving.. to have it deemed as “who would want to be with a person who doesn’t give gifts on special occasions” - I take that personally.. and I just really don’t think that’s a hard rule the way a lot of people here are making it out to be","Does she really want to date someone who doesn't take the time to think ""hey maybe I should find my gf a gift like I told her I would for this major holiday that many many people give gifts for and my gf gave me one two years in a row"". Even if he's not malicious, he's dense and the opposite of thoughtful - how far does this extend into their relationship? Deal breaker."

Granny is a woman but isn’t personally affected in this situation. The question wasn’t addressed to women in general, but specifically to women who might ovulate, and people who are not women but might ovulate.","But if women are the majority of those who do ovulate, what’s wrong with “women and others who ovulate” or “women and those who ovulate”? That way it refers to women who do ovulate as well as trans and non-binary people. I prefer being called a woman and it makes me uncomfortable to be referred to by my body parts or bodily functions.","Not all women ovulate though. When talking about an ovulation tracker, it makes sense to address people who ovulate directly",Women and other people who ovulate,What do you suggest then that might work better?,"Granted.

Though I find this terminology a bit dehumanising for the people it applies to, a large majority of those people being ciswomen."
106,"Actually the rules on PSLF have changed, but you'd have to apply before midnight. Sorry not a scam, just now saw your comment.

Keep trying. You will find a way.",Yes it would be life changing for me. When I originally went to college they were selling us all on the PSLF but that turned out to basically be a massive scam.,"Sounds like you are up against a lot of those - some of them you would face regardless of your education. But, student loans on top of that is not helping. Have you applied for relief? It may not go through, but the answer is always no if you don't apply.","I think that disregards the very real barriers of peoples situations. With the cost of daycare in my area my entire check would go to that so there would be no purpose of me working full time outside the home. Many of us have limited options. I can’t control the cost of child care or that I live in a very HCOL area. I have the best paying job I can, can’t make a higher paying job hire me.","Not being rude, but is that your only option or the only one you like? Most of us have options, but you may not like them. The problem is when anyone is told they can have it all. Life is always full of choices and options. People with less education often have fewer. 

Ask yourself what your options would be if there were no barriers. Then find a way around the barriers. Usually it is our mind and our expectations that are the biggest barrier.","I’m willing to give up my career for children, but if I’d known that’d be my only option I wouldn’t have wasted my time","Some people want to have children though, and would rather give up their career to care for their children than focus on their education and career.","Interesting perspective.  IMO, we shouldn't be saying getting an education is the problem here. The problem is that anyone has to ""mommy track"" themselves, ever."
107,Absolutely. In other countries it wouldn’t be an issue but this is America with no affordable child care or paid maternity leave. Idk how anyone manages to have a career unless they pull like 200k,This should be talked about more than it is. It's fucked up that women have to choose between career and having a family. I got lucky in the sense of student loans but not so much in the career part. I really hope you figure something out that works out for eveyone involved. No one should feel like they have to decide between kids and a fucking career.,"I’d say it’s about the education because if I knew I’d be stuck here making the same crappy pay I made with a bachelors degree, with no access to childcare I wouldn’t have bothered to go to school and waste all this time.",Sounds like that's the barrier not your education. And that's okay. And it's okay to feel let down after you were told you could have it all. Sometimes life simply gets in the way fair or not. So glad you are caring and helping your brother-in-law. Sounds like education was sadly never even an option for him.,We are trying but we my husbands brother is profoundly disabled and we help care for him so we can’t just pick up and go hours away,Move to a LCOL area.,"Yeah absolutely, if I had access to affordable daycare that wouldn’t cost more than my mortgage/take home pay I wouldn’t be on the “mommy track”. But this is the reality especially in a HCOL area.","Interesting perspective.  IMO, we shouldn't be saying getting an education is the problem here. The problem is that anyone has to ""mommy track"" themselves, ever."
108,Honestly that happened about once a week on average. I also got a lot of calls from parents who were fighting with their teenagers and wanted our officers to come talk some sense into them. Like ‘scare them straight’.,"Wow, that happened more than once? The entitlement of some people!","Wow, so sorry to hear this. I was a 911 dispatcher for 5 years. The only people I ever got attitude with were people that called asking for directions and were so entitled to hold up an emergency line.","I once called 911 because a car had stopped in front of my house and the man inside started screaming at and shaking the woman, it was escalating too.I didn't feel safe intervening. 

The 911 operator gave me such attitude, I couldn't believe it.","I don’t understand why people ignore things like that.

I keep a tally of 911 calls… last year I made 14. Couple car crashes, couple of overdoses, fires, etc. but about half were women being harassed/stalked/attacked by male partners.

Most of the time I never run into people again so I never know how things turned out. But at least two of those women did find me after and say it might have saved their lives. How is that not something worth doing, especially when all it costs are a few minutes on the phone?

I understand that it can be overwhelming or sometimes even dangerous to intervene directly, but there’s no excuse for not at least calling for help when someone is in need.","Omg your story is so harrowing. This could have been me. My ex used to always resort to strangling me. It was his MO. 

No matter how loudly I screamed for help while trying to run away from him or talked about it with people practically begging for help, no one ever did. We even had roommates who KNEW and saw what was happening and would go in their room and lock the door rather than help or call the cops. Only once out of 3 years did the cops ever get called and I found out the next day they went to the wrong place and didn’t even follow up or try to find the true source. 

People always talk big like if they heard or saw something they would do something. Lmao. No. Not in my experience. The bystander effect is very real and people are very selfish.","This. So much this. When I was pregnant with my 2nd child, her dad would choke me unconscious in the front yard/driveway, or he would chase me and drag me back into the house. Neighbors absolutely saw/heard. No one ever helped.  Not once. 
I am currently in an undisclosed location with my 3rd child, running from her abusive dad. So, thank you so much for doing what you did.","Thank you for calling the police. 

I used to bartend years ago. I got a side gig catering rich peoples parties. After one, i got a call unreasonably early from my boss. He urgently wanted to know how much I’d served one particular couple. I hadn’t served them much at all. 

He got drunk and beat her to death later. She was screaming for help and nobody did.

You helped. Not everyone does."
109,"I'm so sorry to hear another story like that, I have been so incredibly lucky to have such amazing support. As you said, it's so vital. My abuser was wealthy, which didn't help- he thought he could just buy an expensive lawyer. Worked for awhile, against combined testimony and SO much support it did eventually fail.

You know the "" If I was rich "" question? I'd quite seriously fund all the relief organizations and fund lawyers who take simply no crap.",">Also had amazing, very strong family support.

This is so important for an abuse victim but often gets overlooked. I knew a woman who escaped her abuser only to have some family member tell him where she was. He  dragged her back.  She thought he had the ability to find her wherever she went. (This was in the 80's so no apple tracking devices. )I tried to tell her that her meth addicted husband doesn't have an inside with the government to track her down but she believed him because she couldn't accept that someone in her family betrayed her.

Someone very close to me had their father-who they adored- tell them to go back with the abusive asshole because she had a child.","Right. What happens is, the longer she's pretty much forced to stay with him, the less hope and mental ability she has to leave. Despite what it looks like it is a form of brain washing. 

When I was in a safe house a therapist or someone ( don't remember who she was, not a lot was registering at that point, I was just terrified ) gave a group talk. Onus was how not to go back to an abuser.

Asked her later "" How many go back? "" Seemed surreal to me, he didn't have his claws into me that deep yet and I had a baby to protect. She looked around, made this almost hopeless gesture said "" All of them "". I said "" I won't "". That doesn't make me special, like I said he didn't have his psycho claws deep enough into me yet . Also had amazing, very strong family support.

Please do report, every time. Might be someone not too far into a psycho's power to break free. Have always worried about those other women. And their kids- there were other kids in there too. Also wish that woman could know I didn't go back . The baby that was saved is now a doc. She knows about her father, goes to therapy and by a wonderful stroke of fortune he's dead.

And I'm happy about that too. Don't care if that sounds heartless.","People ignore it often when people choose to be with someone abusive. Because you call the cops on someone for beating his girlfriend and the cops show up and the girlfriend is defending the boyfriend, saying leave them alone, calling the person who called the cops an asshole and getting in their face about it.

That's the problem with abuse, people stay with their abusers and people who try to help them get pushed aside as interferring or all manor of other justifications. Shit sometimes they'll call you jealous or upset you don't have anyone and just trying to ruin their relationship.

I had to call the cops on the people in the apartment right by mine as after a week of partying noises and frustration it suddenly got way worse, shit flying off balcony, sounded like a proper beatdown going on. Called cops and they had to threaten to break in as the guy responsible locked himself in while the 'victim' had fled by then. Turns out they managed to bend a steel bar reinforced door, smashed balcony window, one of them went through a table and a guitar and tv got thrown out the balcony. 

Pregnant girlfriend and his family stay there (despite accusations he beats her). A few weeks later I here another fight but the other guy had already moved out so it was the guy and his pregnant girlfriend. I heard what sounded like her saying ""I can't breathe, stop"" so I called the cops and went to knock on the door at the same time to try to stop him doing anything worse before cops got there.

She eventually left and I walked with her to her car, she was thankful but also made excuses for him, didn't stay to talk to cops (though they talked to her later). 

Cops basically couldn't do anything, the friend who got put through a table and door did nothing, she didn't leave and was back there the next day, all I got was the stink eye from both for calling cops.

That's the issue, you interfere and the abused dramatically more often than not stays with the abuser.

The obsession is unimaginable.,"> Sounds like you're making it about you and your experience rather than the potential danger that you could be stopping by calling.

112,"This still has nothing to do with what I said. Stalking and obsessive exes are a major, massive issue, but one that is very difficult to deal with as laws aren't really designed to stop people who haven't broken significant laws. Stalkers are an issue around the world because people who follow you and call your work, try to get you fired haven't broken any laws by doing so yet. 

But again, that has nothing to do with anything I spoke about. Leaving someone, leaving the house you live with your partner in and are in a relationship with is what I'm talking about. How you deal with an ex who won't leave you alone is a completely different situation. For one thing you have to leave said relationship and stop living them to be in the situation you're talking about.

You said what I talked about was a jurisdiction issue, but you're talking about something that I didn't mention once.","WTAF? I left 5 years ago.

Cutting them off from friends and family is a choice you allow to make, and yes I understand why it happens. but being cut off from friends and family in no way means you have no choice but to stay and saying their is no choice is frankly gross.

>Saying that people choose to stay is entirely incorrect and gets people killed.

Saying they have no choice gets people killed, they have a choice, you're denying that they have authority over themselves, you're treating abused partners as not just victims but wholy incapable of acting on their own. 

It also ignores that eventually, after the 15th time they get back together and finally leave their abusive partner, it's because they exercised their choice.

113,"Saying that someone chooses to stay with an abuser is effectively the same as saying it's their fault for getting hit. It's very odd that you're so insistent that it's a choice and claiming that anything else is ""taking their agency away"".","Can you point to the part where I said it was there fault for getting hit? Anywhere, something that even remotely sounded like that?

You taking away agency for adults who have the choice to leave at any time as being completely unable to leave is nothing short of ridiculous and saying that adults who have the capacity to leave an choose not to is victim blaming, well, that's pathetic frankly.","Holy victim blaming, Batman.","> You clearly have no idea how abuse works. These women aren't staying by choice. Abusers gaslight and brainwash their victims into thinking they have no other options. 

No, they do have options and they almost always have a choice, they just choose the bad option. 

I absolutely know how abuse works, you do not. Someone gaslighting you is doesn't mean you have no choices. If you choose to ignore teh abuse and allow their lies to persuade you to stay that's still a choice. 

Cutting them off from friends and family is a choice you allow to make, and yes I understand why it happens. but being cut off from friends and family in no way means you have no choice but to stay and saying their is no choice is frankly gross.

Cops come, arrest the boyfriend and you're literally physically separated, but you have no choice but to defend your boyfriend/husband, bail them out and stay with them, absolute bullshit. 

>Saying that people choose to stay is entirely incorrect and gets people killed.

Saying they have no choice gets people killed, they have a choice, you're denying that they have authority over themselves, you're treating abused partners as not just victims but wholy incapable of acting on their own. 

It also ignores that eventually, after the 15th time they get back together and finally leave their abusive partner, it's because they exercised their choice. The choice is often hard, horrible, it can mean taking your kids into the unknown, or potentially facing homelessness, but to say there is no choice is fucking ridiculous.","> People ignore it often when people choose to be with someone abusive. Because you call the cops on someone for beating his girlfriend and the cops show up and the girlfriend is defending the boyfriend, saying leave them alone, calling the person who called the cops an asshole and getting in their face about it.

You clearly have no idea how abuse works. These women aren't staying by choice. Abusers gaslight and brainwash their victims into thinking they have no other options. They cut them off from friends and family so they have no support network. They convince them that the abuse is their fault, that they're ""making"" the abuser do it.

Because you call the cops on someone for beating his girlfriend and the cops show up and the girlfriend is defending the boyfriend, saying leave them alone, calling the person who called the cops an asshole and getting in their face about it.

That's the problem with abuse, people stay with their abusers and people who try to help them get pushed aside as interferring or all manor of other justifications. Shit sometimes they'll call you jealous or upset you don't have anyone and just trying to ruin their relationship.

I had to call the cops on the people in the apartment right by mine as after a week of partying noises and frustration it suddenly got way worse, shit flying off balcony, sounded like a proper beatdown going on. Called cops and they had to threaten to break in as the guy responsible locked himself in while the 'victim' had fled by then. Turns out they managed to bend a steel bar reinforced door, smashed balcony window, one of them went through a table and a guitar and tv got thrown out the balcony. 

Pregnant girlfriend and his family stay there (despite accusations he beats her). A few weeks later I here another fight but the other guy had already moved out so it was the guy and his pregnant girlfriend. I heard what sounded like her saying ""I can't breathe, stop"" so I called the cops and went to knock on the door at the same time to try to stop him doing anything worse before cops got there.

She eventually left and I walked with her to her car, she was thankful but also made excuses for him, didn't stay to talk to cops (though they talked to her later). 

Cops basically couldn't do anything, the friend who got put through a table and door did nothing, she didn't leave and was back there the next day, all I got was the stink eye from both for calling cops.

That's the issue, you interfere and the abused dramatically more often than not stays with the abuser. You get emotionally invested, you feel responsible by calling the cops, you have to talk with cops and take the anger from the people you called the cops on and the result is usually that the abused gives you shit as well as the abuser.

114,"I've done the same, and my father still hasn't left.  All the kids survived miraculously. And only because we got the fuck out.","My father wouldn't leave my step mother.  He wound up dead. Police wouldn't do anything because he wouldn't say anything. My siblings and i couldn't convince him. The church didn't actually care. 

When i was young, he would abuse my mother. Police would be called by neighbors, but she wouldn't leave. He'd just beat her again for making him look bad. She eventually did find the courage to leave on her own. No one could convince her before that, though.

I do understand. I have been there, both as a child and as an adult. There's no way to help a person who doesn't want to be helped.","Not interfering leads to more opportunities of death and damage.  It gets worse even if you don't interfere.

My mom stopped slapping us and started throwing us against walls.  Neighbors made comments about how strict our household was.

She used to berate or pinch or slap. She started grabbing your hair and slamming heads against objects.

Finally, she knocked my father down the basement steps and then went down and grabbed his head to smash it against the concrete floor. Neighbors continued to laugh at my father. Blaming him for the horrible abuse he constantly took. They would rather make jokes about his masculinity. They would rather watch this for decades.

I overheard gossip as they stood outside staring toward our house.

Hoping one of the adults would know what to do. But all they ever did was ignore or mock our suffering. 

Calling the police on my own mother was so emotionally difficult. Because the abuse teaches you to freeze or fawn to keep things peaceful. Survival is protecting and coddling your abuser. If you can just be good enough, keep them happy and calm...well, if they get angry it's your fault. Not theirs

 Living in abuse is a fucked up survival mentality
 
Calling the police on her would be counter to survival. Your whole body breaks down even considering such a betrayal. Even if it's in defense of your siblings and father, the thing is their survival is also tied up in the abuser. Your every instinct goes against protecting yourself.

 I had to learn to discard wanting to survive.  The hope for anything improving had to die entirely. And I was finally able to do something so traitorous as calling the police for help.
 
It was something I was only able to learn once I lost all trust in the community.

They knew. They did nothing. 
 
Neighbors looking the other way just means you are a silent audience to whatever comes next. Maybe they leave. Maybe someone ends up dead.  But years of trauma will continue unchecked.

Interfering is better.  Even if it can occasionally be a catalyst.","Because they don't leave their abusive partner, and they get even worse treatment once the cops leave.

115,"Right. I have a friend who was dating a girl a while back, and I suspected that she was abusing him. I knew him several years before he dated her, and we worked at the same place.

She told me that he was crazy, and abusive, and that he once put a cigarette out on her arm. Normally if anyone were to hear that you'd be alarmed for the woman. But this one was different. She told me this almost.... gleefully? And he was sitting there right next to her, not saying anything. As time passed, my friend was becoming increasingly sullen at work. She called him almost daily, accusing him of cheating on her. He would complain about her spending all of the money he had put in their joint account.

One day we all went out to eat somewhere and I think she said something I disagreed with, and logically explained why, which probably made her feel stupid. After that day, my friend started making excuses as to why he couldn't hang out after work anymore. On top of that, there were some other mutual friends they had that saw him as an abuser so they stopped hanging out with him. She was isolating him.

One day she texted me saying to stop giving advice to him. She claimed it was because his dad wanted them to only follow the advice of the couple's counselor they were supposedly both seeing.

I ended up messaging his dad on Facebook, and he was aware that she wasn't all that she was cracked up to be, and asked me to support his son, which I was going to do anyway.

Eventually they broke up, but was still wanting her to take him back. He was eventually served a restraining order. I went to the courtroom with him, but he accepted ended up not fighting it, and accepted the restraining order, which was the best thing he could have done. Because now he legally had to stay away from her (and vice versa).","I know what they wrote, but apparently people can't read what I wrote.

We do not know the motivations for those who do not interfere. Maybe they are weak. Or, maybe they were in the same situation as the victim just yesterday and are so triggered they freeze. Perhaps they are scared. Perhaps their own abuse has made them numb. Perhaps they are assholes. Who knows. But, to just lump them all together as ""weak"" is wrong - it is implying that someone needs to be perfect in these situations (and, I compared it to society's view of the perfect victim, too - one who leaves on the first offence and who behaves exactly as society expects - both are skewed views).

We need to focus our scorn on the *abusers*. Not the victims. Not the witnesses. They (the abusers) are the ones who are wrong here. When witnesses are called weak, we are blaming them for what happened, when it is the abuser who abused.","Theyre saying its weak not to call the cops or at least think twice about helping, not weak to stay with your abuser",">Weak.

I have called the cops many times. And, it did no good - the victim still stayed. This doesn't stop me from calling, even though I have always been afraid the abuser would figure out who called and come at me. That fear is legit.

No one saw the full series of events. But about about a dozen people saw part of it.

Two of the 12 called police. Only one person went outside, a 70yr old woman who held Kitty as she died. After she was stabbed and raped. 

I'm sorry but 2 people saw her get stabbed. One only called the police AFTER she was basically dead, AND the old lady found her and started shouting:

He saw Genovese laying on the ground, still alive and attempting to speak, and Moseley stabbing her. He shut the door and called a friend to ask what to do. The friend said not to get involved.

Ross eventually climbed out of his window and went to a neighbors apartment. He called the police after hearing Sophie Farrar call for someone to do so. Ross’ explanation—“I didn’t want to get involved”—became the famous rejoinder of the Bystander Effect.""

120,"That's an interesting topic... thanks for the book recommendation, I might have to read it. There's definitely lots of bullying types in my workplace.

Seems like it might the workplace version of a pdf I got on reddit : ""Why does he do that"" by Lundy Bancroft.  Which focuses on abusive relationships iirc.


Idk. A long time ago, in middle school... i found out another girl was being raped by her father. I didn't tell a guidance counselor because I didn't want to make her situation worse. I've checked up on her facebook, and she seems to be well adjusted and living a happy life. But what if things turned poorly? She was always cutting her wrists (self harm, not suicidal)... what if she died? I probably would have regretted not speaking up. I'm glad she turned out okay. But I don't like to live with regrets, wondering if things would have turned out differently if I had just DONE something or said something. 


I might regret it if i get seriously and permanently hurt trying to help someone. But i definitely will regret it if I provide 0 help. If that makes sense.","Of course. 

There's an interesting book, *Nasty People and How To Avoid Being Hurt By Them.* (I think. It's been a while) It's more about manipulative workplace bully types, not physical abuse. But the lesson is the same - Why do people say/do nasty things? One main reason is because they don't feel good about themselves, and they boost their own self-esteem by putting others down. For the physically abusive, this means inflicting hurt so they can feel that they are superior, because deep down they know or suspect they are less than others and can ""prove"" this is not so by being the physically dominant.","If they're gonna hurt a victim for someone trying to save them, they were going to hurt the victim anyways. 

Interfering doesn't change anything when you have someone violent who is looking for an excuse to abuse.


Ie. The abuser will say ""I'm only doing this because you tried to escape"". But if they didn't try to escape? Then the abuser will say ""I'm only doing this because you didn't wash the dishes"". 

It's like how a cheater will always cheat... an abuser will always abuse. They just make up excuses and find anything wrong so they can try to explain their behavior. When deep down it's just that they're fucked up.","Very good points. 

Except - nowadays, a bully knows the power of a phone and will see any move to call, record, or whatever as a provocative move. And, they are unpredictable. Stand well back, be ready to run. 

I'm an average height, slightly(?) overweight guy - but I haven't been in a serious fight since grade school. I seriously doubt I could take on some guy who has a habit of physical violence and a berserker attitude where they could be aggressive without regard to themselves getting hurt.  I don't want to find out the hard way, because if I lose the victim- if they don't want to leave - is no better off than when I started. Most likely worse, now the guy is angrier. ""See what trouble you brough onto me!!??""","Calling 911 takes less than a minute, assuming you know where you are. (And you should always know where you are tbh, pay attention to street names and businesses nearby... or look for a nearby house #). 

Then hit record on your phone. To get video of the person and what they look like. What they're doing. 

Telling them you called the police and are recording them will often get some to stop without a physical altercation. 


It can be a bit more obvious if they're on drugs or drunk... in that case just keep your distance. 
It shouldn't be too hard to outrun a drunk if you're in even half decent shape. 


I'm a petite woman who weighs just over 100lbs. Doesn't mean i would just run and hope the police or someone else did something. If i get hurt. Then i get hurt. But at least i wasn't a coward who stood by and didn't even try to help someone being actively hurt. 


Granted, physically interfering depends case by case. If you see a stranger attacking someone for no reason (ie a random street attack or something), then take into account, can you AND the victim handle the stranger? Are there any makeshift weapons you can use nearby? 


Domestics are a bit different. Because the victim has to be the one to want to leave. And if they aren't ready to leave their abuser, they'll likely attack you or get mad at you for interfering. And let's be real, there are very few cases where a woman is being locked in a house and 100% unable to physically leave. They usually stay out of a misguided sense of love. And repeatedly willingly go back home to their abuser.","The problem is... what are you going to do?  The aggressor is likely drunk, and obviously acting irrationally. Unless you're the type who can definitely win a no-hold-barred bar fight, the moment you get involved you put yourself at risk. 

Calling the police is obviously the best idea. However, you are dealing with an irrational violent person. If you even open your door or knock on theirs  to tell him off, and then the police show up, he may simply blame the person who told him off. Just call the police and let them handle it.","This. In my experience, most people don't call. Don't interfere. Most people are not good people. A good person would interfere if able, or at least call AND ensure the police found the right place and were able to intervene. 

Most people don't want to be bothered, tbh. And like to think of themseves as good because they would never beat their wife... but that's not all it takes to be good. Being good also includes stopping people doing bad shit.","Omg your story is so harrowing. This could have been me. My ex used to always resort to strangling me. It was his MO.

121,"Hmm indeed, I always thought that mu expectations are too high but in the end this is what I want.. thanks for sharing your thoughts.. I will contemplate on my relationship because that seem to be the issue","There's a difference between giving him a chance to change with grace and patience and waiting too long for him to change in ways he has no interest in changing. 10 years is a *long* time, and it's highly unlikely anything about the relationship will change significantly after so much time and you telling him what you need.

Not telling him about something like this is going to seem like you're hiding it and that's going to make it look like a bigger deal than it is if the information comes out. Regardless of how much it's your own stupid issue, you should still be able to rely on your partner for moral support in dealing with it. What's the point of having a partner if you can't count on them to help you out when times are tough?",Is not about honesty.. I think is more about if it is fair to drag him in thing stupid situation.. is my issue and I need to work it out,"What would hurt worse? You telling him now that you're having these feelings and asking for his help to deal, or him finding out on his own at a later date possibly after things have escalated further?

Logically, extreme violence is an indicator that the perpetrator **is not** mentally ill, so they should be handled with a level of wariness that **exceeds** that used around people who are genuinely mentally ill. 

The violent perpetrator has the greater capacity to assess, plan, mislead, and enact violence - a true and ongoing threat to anyone who gets close enough. 

People are unsettled by the perception of unpredictability in a mentally ill person, but perceived threat does not translate to actual threat. The average person wants to think that a sane person (as they think they themselves are) is not capable of such brutality. Spolier: some humans just suck.

Thinking mental illness = threat is a bias I wish everyone would examine within themselves. The world could be a kinder place if we did.","Thank you!

134,"I remember watching a true crime doc about a teenage girl who lured a 12yo girl into her car and took her out to this place in the woods and brutally tortured her before killing her. And unsurprisingly it turned out her parents had done some truly horrifying things to her throughout her short life. It made me so sad that the teenage girl, though she was the one who actually did the horrible acts to the other girl, was to be punished for the rest of her life because of what her parents had done to her. It disturbed me that her parents wouldn't even get punished for what they did either. Our society is all about pointing the finger and calling it justice and then we're shocked that horrible things keep happening. I think people have a hard time understanding that trying to help, to rehabilitate, to prevent, to teach, etc. is not the same as excusing horrible actions. 

I'm very sorry about your uncle.","People are so supportive of trauma victims—until they admit to committing some heinous crime during a trauma response, that is. Once victim becomes victimizer we call them depraved monsters. My dad used to say your empathy isn’t worth much if you can only empathize with people you understand, and I think that applies here. I really don’t think anyone *set outs* to become a sociopath.

I’ll never forget my mom telling me about my kind and mind-mannered uncle coming back from Vietnam asa very young man and maniacally running down a dog in the road. He later said he couldn’t clearly recall the incident, and was really disturbed by it happening. He also experienced what everyone called “extreme fits of jealousy” when he later married the love of his life, a widow to a young man who died in Vietnam, whose photos he would violently smash while hyperventilating. It seemed clear to me that there was a hell of a lot more to it than just “jealousy”.

I’ve been in relationships with people who were badly abused as children and have seen a couple different versions of trauma responses. When that shit hits, I really don’t think people have control. They become strangers to me, but also to themselves. These were people whose abuse ended by elementary school yet it clearly affected them deeply. Even with a therapist, with family support and a very motivated individual, it is really, really hard to undo that damage. And most people aren’t getting any of that.

I’m fairly sure there are statistics on this and the fact is that a significant portion of violent offenders in prison have experienced significant trauma. You can absolutely fuck up basic human development, like self-regulation and empathy, with the right combo of trauma and lack of support.

ETA: And I honestly don’t know why people act like suggesting there could be some reason humans seem more capable of heinous violence in some geographic regions vs others is “letting people off”, but I suspect it had something to do with the “justice=punishment” mindset that puts dangerous people in concrete boxes with each other so they can become even more poorly-suited due release into society.","I don't want to argue with you because I've got the whole gamut of mental illness myself, but it is very very common for abusers to have been abused themselves. They are often mentally ill. Well-adjusted people do not abuse others. And pointing out the mental damage that using violence as punishment for children causes can help teach folks to stop doing stuff like that.

148,"> if you genuinely don't trust your SA with sex

It's usually shortened SO for significant other, SA tends to mean sexual assault.","For lots of guys, throat fucking is a kink, including for me. I've only ever been able to do it a few times because most women don't like that gag reflex, and I totally respect that. Just make sure to set boundaries beforehand, and if your SA violate those boundaries, consider leaving. This is just to say that this kind of kink isn't far-fetched by any means. Hell, it's an entire category of its own on most porn sites. On the other hand, I've had gfs whose kink was rough play/hands tied/light slapping. This is not a kink for me at all and I feel super weird slapping a girl, even if it turns her on. I guess we're all very different and we all have our own kinks. Just make sure to set boundaries beforehand and make it clear that a violation of those boundaries will result in you leaving.

In this particular case, I think only you can make this decision. Like you mentioned, I don't know if your past sexual trauma is leaking into this situation or if you genuinely don't trust your SA with sex anymore. Look deep within yourself and decide how you feel about the whole thing and go from there. Don't listen to all of us as only you can gauge whether he is being genuinely sincere and whether you can move past this.

151,"Oh my God, that's horrifyingly",The reports that a record number of teenaged girls are being admitted to the hospital for anal tears makes me deeply uncomfortable and sad,"This. You immediately get branded as not being sex positive if you want to have a frank discussion about the increasing misogyny in porn or the bdsm crowd (which seems like everyone now.) I have a teen niece who talks to me, and know that so many of these girls believe that they have to do anything a boy wants to be desirable, even if it feels terrible. 90% of the porn online these days is extremely degrading to women, and this is mainstream now, not even seen as kink. Violently skull f'ing, hair pulling, spitting on women, calling them whores, slapping their faces, coming on their faces/tongues, etc. is all totally normalized as mainstream, not even branded as kink. I'm sex positive, but I think a lot of girls have been bamboozled into accepting sexual aggression and misogyny by shaming them for supposedly not being sex positive or cool if they don't want to be treated like garbage cans. Somehow I feel like our feminism has been used against us in today's culture to trick us into doing sh\*t that feels degrading and painful. I'm uncomfortable with the turn it has taken. 

I can't help but think of Armie Hammer, using the guise of BDSM to rape and abuse very young women, telling them they don't need a safe word and they belong to him to do anything he wants with them, burning them, carving his initials in their skin, biting them, beating them, choking them, all without explicit consent, going well beyond their limits and providing no aftercare when he left them behind, bleeding and severely bruised. All of that was done in the name of kink, and he thinks that just because he talked them into being tied up, that they no longer could withdraw consent for any act he chose to do to them. Each of those girls describes feeling totally confused and violated, but not having had the language to explain at the time how he raped them when they agreed to sex and even BDSM, but not the extreme violence that he escalated it to without their consent.","I try to be sex-positive and I get that BDSM is a thing but I wish we could have an honest conversation about whether a bunch of the men ""into BDSM"" that hurts/dominates women could just be violent misogynists who use kink to excuse their impulses","Guys who hurt you during sex actually just want to hurt you.

152,"100% agree! You have to really want it on your own and be secure. Any pressure or if it comes from a relationship is horrible.

155,"The harm from kink shaming is so minuscule relative to the harm of excusing sexual predators, so the BDSM person you mention seems more interested in the latter and I’d be suspicious they had ulterior motives. I think there’s a way of weeding out the abusers from the legitimate practitioners and this sort of thing might be one way. 

I think it’s a safe bet that men who want to hurt women and use BDSM as a cover are more likely to have deeply ingrained misogyny that they can’t hide, whereas people whose sexuality is defined by kink and would be just as horrified as anyone else at the thought of actually hurting someone likely have a better understanding of interpersonal and societal power dynamics","I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to say that kink is like that in the majority of cases.

164,thank you! i was going to type a longer comment to that person saying essentially this but i really just don’t have the energy to argue about this anymore lol.,"Oh for fucks sake! Porn is not normal sex. It's manufactured for men, and uses women where it chews them up and spits them out. I'm from LA, the porn capital of the WORLD. And guess what? Every time there is an outbreak of fucking syphilis (which is really deadly), the clap, or pretty much any other STD, it can always **BE TRACED BACK TO THE PORN INDUSTRY**. 

Not to mention that it is very damaging to young children that are just coming into their sexuality and don't know shit about sex, to watch two adults go at it where the guy throws the girl around, chokes her, cums on her face, and skullfucks here. NONE OF THAT SHIT IS NORMAL. Women internalize this shit as young girls, and men internalize this shit as young boys.

We live in a country that really lacks in sexual education, and yet, porn is everywhere. That's pretty much what young children are getting as a sex ed. 

>Porn is a huge industry

Which is also largely unregulated and does not practice safe sex. People in porn circles DIE because of the rampant STDs that happen. Yet the porn industry doesn't give a shit about them, they just keep on keep on, refusing to get their male actors to wear condoms and practicing questionable business practices. You may be unaware of that side of it, but the porn industry is seedy as fuck in every possible way. 

I am very sex positive and don't have any pearls to clutch. But porn just keeps getting more and more extreme, and further and further away from what real sex is.","I highly doubt all these things you are clutching your pearls over are as new as pornography is, it’s more like we as a society have changed and people are more open and comfortable discussing their sexual proclivities. I’m also unsure why you keep trying to demonize porn, it can 100% be part of a healthy sex life (whether single or in a relationship), and you may be surprised to learn that not only do plenty of women watch porn, they also watch it with their partners and use it to open up discussions about mutual fantasies and kinks. Porn is a huge industry and there is literally something for everyone, some people really like the more hard core stuff (and there is plenty of it), but there are lots of people who like gentler, more female pleasure and couple/romance focused porn (and there is plenty of this as well).","In this case it wasn't.

I'm just asking so I understand. 

It could be more concerning or less concerning depending on the answer.",People can change any boundary at any time. If that's not respected* that's SA. He knew she didn't want it rough and did it anyway.,"I think it does matter :)  It does not make it OK even if it's normal for them,  but it does change the background.

So some actually do care more about being hateful than anything else in the world.,"Precisely this.  That is my question.

I was surprised those who admitted on camera their support in forcing raped 10-year-olds to give birth (or die trying) didn't result in any ... consequences.  Figured for sure a mama or papa bear would .. react to an admission like that.

That it isn't blasting out all over TV is .. kinda shocking.  Republicans admit that they are *literally* after your children.

Sometimes it makes me furious and other times I see it more as a handicap.",There have been studies on this!,"Oh, I’m quite convinced that men don’t process womens’ speech in the same way. I think that’s what’s behind situations where men will mansplain your idea back to you as if they just came up with it themselves.

Which is why I had just made it myself 3 minutes ago.” Lol.","it is so frustrating. I think some men just don’t process words from women as having any actual meaning to them. 

it reminds me of the posts I see on here about “I told him and asked him over and over again to change for years or I would leave and now that I am finally leaving and packing my bags he is finally changing or he finally understands that i’m serious.” men must operate on a different part of the brain or something. fucking drives me nuts.

And those that let it slide until the opportunity arises to be the knight coming to the rescue are just as bad as Paul.


I agree that her handling that situation was the best course of action, but sadly could have turned out differently if Paul had lashed out. Hell OP needs to keep an eye on Paul just in case he decides to retaliate later perhaps she should go to HR if she hasn't yet.","I don’t know. Allowing her to handle the situation can also show that they didn’t want to imply she needed a rescue.

Her handling it herself changed his behavior in a way another man interfering probably wouldn’t’ve.",">Men could have shoved him away

OP, beware of these others as much as Paul. They either don't have a problem/share his mindset and are simply more risk averse, or they're indifferent cowards who won't do a thing to stand up for you.

This shit should have been cut short by them at the first comment, anything short is fostering a predatory environment.","The fact that you had to slap him just to have the *immense privilege* of not feeling violated by a creep treating you like a walking commodity...

I am so thankful. This is a weird type of validation that I didn't even know I needed. I'm a bit lost for words but what you just said restored some of my peace.","People don't like admitting bad things happen.  We fear them and many people try to hide from the truth, that bad things do happen.

Men don't have to deal with the frequency, ubiquity, or severity of sexual assault so most chose to pretend it doesn't happen.  Lots of women like to prescribe traits to victims in an attempt to distance themselves from bad things.

This is one of those things that many people, men and women, will try to invalidate your feelings on.  They will try to make it seem less severe because they want it to be.  But it doesn't change reality and you need to listen to yourself better and not let others' convince you it isn't a serious issue.

Men do not need to be following you, or running after your car, or banging on you windows.  All that is really fucked.

It helps to crank your air on full blast and shoot it out of a cracked window with all the other windows up.",Wow you're totally right thank you for validating my feelings and making me realize the severity of this.

I don't know how those words can be misunderstood. All decent men will leave if told I am taken. I can count the number of guys on one hand who still hassled me when told this and I am in my late 30s now. That's a lot of years.

So idk about you but I don't actually know how it's supposed to be?,"Yeah I mean if it was a procedure that was widely known as being maximum level uncomfortable, outdated, old-fashioned...I would have a different opinion.","That's actually insane that so many women on here can convince themselves to get through it, I don't understand how y'all do it. I was telling myself the same stuff at my appt, on god, and it was still unbearable.","Yeah, there was something that helped me, I sort of just told myself over and over it will be over in a minute, I trust this doctor, she has a careful touch so I trust her...basically just taking deep breaths and trusting that the doctor knows what she is doing.
I think it's good they rescheduled, no need to start again right after quitting, that was nice of them. Better to wait it out then retry later.",I just had a pap smear done and I really wanted to get it over with and done too but I just couldn't. I even asked them after I got dressed if we could try again but they didn't want to because it went so bad. I know it's for my health to get it done so I rescheduled of course but I'm really stressed out and I think it's once again not gonna work. Was there anything in particular that helped you when it hurt?,"Yeah in short, the second time it hurt a little bit more than I expected it to. I did let her finish the exam because I trust her as she's a doctor (and the nurses also did there best with me, like asking if I prefer a female doc or if either female or male is fine. I felt more prepared because I knew they took the time to check that with me, for instance.) And I wanted to finish the pap smear since I went all the way there to get it done, because preventative treatment is better than treating something that's blown out of proportion, just trying to stay healthy etc."

She also didn't say that it being so painful was abnormal. I think maybe I should ask her about it","Yes. It’s similar to when they put their fingers inside you to check your ovaries, or when you insert a tampon. Not a “fun” feeling, but not painful","Is that how it is for you?

I know these questions are dumb as hell and I'm sorry but you're legit blowing my mind","No. It’s just something being inserted into the vagina, it’s not by itself a process that should have any pain associated with it.",Wait really? The speculum part shouldn't hurt?,"The speculum being inserted and opened should be painless. I wouldn’t call that part fun, you wouldn’t just go have that done to yourself because it feels good, but that is not a painful thing at all. More just discomfort or feeling weird or odd.","She told me they were quick! I could barely get past the speculum being inserted though, and every time she actually tried to open it the pain was so intense. I just don't know if how much I hurt is normal and if I should just bear it when it should be quick","Painless no. It’s quick though, you just have to let them get the cells. It takes seconds"

189,Exactly! - thanks for helping me clarify,"Okay, sorry I misunderstood. I totally thought you were saying that this was women’s fault for not leaving when they saw this.

But now I get you’re just saying we should hold men to a higher standard. Especially at the beginning of the relationship. Which I totally agree with. 

Like, it’s not cute that you still send your laundry gone for your mom to do - it’s ridiculous.","I honestly think we agree on this. I absolutely think it’s a men problem! I’m sorry if I framed it as only a woman’s issue. And I can definitely empathize with people whose partners change late in the relationship and stop caring, as well as how difficult divorce must be. 

Your examples were good and I didn’t mean to dismiss them - it’s more nuanced than I made it seem. 

I guess my thoughts were more directed at newer relationships where it becomes obvious that you’re dating a man child and it’s easier to walk away. 💕","I’m saying it’s not an option because you don’t know until it’s very late in the relationship. And yes, you can divorce someone over their housework division, but most of the time, women are told that there aren’t any men that are going to do it any better so she should just be happy with the one she has.

I also like that you’re framing this as a women’s issue when it is absolutely something that men should address.","I appreciate all the examples, but it really does boil down to: you get what you tolerate. And it often really is that simple. Being able to communicate like an adult and being willing and able to walk away are really the only other requirements that come to play in your examples.

Edit: a lot of women don’t have the options we have in the US, but for most of us - just don’t marry or have kids with someone who can’t do housework like an adult

Edit2 lol: I disagree about “not an option” - barring extreme circumstances, you choose your partners! And no, I don’t think breaking up over something like someone being unwilling to contribute to housework is strange at all","That’s not always an option. Haven’t you ever had a roommate or anything who for the first year (or months) was great and took out the trash and always cleaned their dishes and such - and then after a while devolved and it strained your relationship?

Or, you’re dating someone, and when everything’s good, you’re great, but a stressor happens and then the relationship changes because you never went through any relationship-testing events earlier in the relationship? 

Also, if you straight up ask many people, I’m sure they’d say - yes, I’m going to carry my own weight. But then you have kids, and they’re tired after a long day of work, and slowly but surely they push work off onto their spouse. And you’re not going to divorce just because of that - especially if you’ve got kids. But you may get to a point where your spouse only does things if you remind them - and then, you’re either the nagging spouse or you get overwhelmed by the chores and blow up and then you expected him to read your mind.

Additionally, that doesn’t solve the issue that women shouldn’t have to interrogate men and come up with scenarios to see if they’ll pull their own weight. We’re gonna have to make it work so that’s the expectation. 

And a lot of women don’t even know to look for that. Before I left home - I thought everyone could do certain things. Then when I got to college I realized that (both women and men) were lacking housework skills. Women might just expect that men will pull their own weight and dive into a relationship. In my Catholic family, you’re basically a slut if you live with your bf pre-marriage (I don’t subscribe to that idea but just giving an example of a cultural norm). So she’s never lived with him, and now they’re married and divorce is frowned upon and she learns that he won’t keep up his half without nagging which he’ll blame her for. 

That doesn’t even touch on the fact that we’re still at a point where men generally have a higher pay then their spouse and that often gets held over their heads. Even if they spend the same amount of time at work. 

So yes, it would be great if we could just avoid those men, but it’s not always possible, and sometimes you don’t see that side of them until it’s late.

Plus, there is tremendous pressure for women to settle so that they can get married. Imagine she’s been dating someone for years and they finally move in together. He’s nice and funny and good-looking and whatever. But she notices that he never puts his dishes away and she’s always the one to vacuum and whatever. She might complain about that to her friends - but a lot of the time that wouldn’t be an immediate dealbreaker. They’d say - at least he’s not abusing you or cheating etc. And breaking up over some dishes seems strange right?

But then they have kids, and the burden of domestic work for her increases exponentially and all the little things build. Again, she’s trapped in the - do I become the nagging wife that he makes jokes about hating all the time or do I keep this to myself and become overwhelmed with work?",That is a fixable problem - stop choosing partners that don’t pull their own weight with housework.,"That is absolutely true, and working women end up doing most of the housework anyway so the workload is becoming even more unequal in a lot of households."

I think one thing they both instilled in me was just accepting basic responsibities. If the lawn is looking overgrown, get lawn mower out. If the floor is dirty get the vacuum or mop. If there are dirty clothes wash them. If you are hungry then cook something. It's all basic stuff.

I'm not sure how you think women are supposed to find the few men who truly will, particularly when they're outnumbered by those who won't. It's not even necessarily an intention thing - many men *think* they're putting in equal effort when they are not. They often underestimate what it takes to run a household and care for children.","I’m assuming you’re making a joke? Because there are men out there that will split housework, and it’s up to women not to put up with ones that don’t.",Straight women do not choose to be heterosexual.,That is a fixable problem - stop choosing partners that don’t pull their own weight with housework.,"That is absolutely true, and working women end up doing most of the housework anyway so the workload is becoming even more unequal in a lot of households."
195,"Ok, but wouldn't you have to stay at 1500 cal to maintain even if you had never been overweight? 

That's what I'm asking.","I know I can never go back to eating what i want. Since I'm short and losing weight very slowly at 1300-1400 calories a day, I'll probably hopefully be able to eat 1500 cal to maintain. 

Yes. I will forever have to eat less to maintain. This is correct.","> You will forever have to eat less to maintain than if you had never been obese.

Why? Does the body 'get used to' being overweight and does some weird metabolism stuff differently?","Sadly being fat is the last 'acceptable' reason to mock people.

I say good on you. 50 is a serious accomplishment!!  Losing weight is almost unsurmountabley difficult.  And its not like once it's off you can eat a 'normal' amount if you have been obese.  You will forever have to eat less to maintain than if you had never been obese.  It sucks.","It takes a hell of a lot of effort. I've lost 50 and live life day to day at a caloric deficit. My body doesn't want to do it. But my will power has been strong enough this time for some reason. 

Thing is, I'm still fat. So i get those lazy assumptions that idgaf about my health even though I'm 220 days into this battle and have at least that much to go. 

What can I do though? I'm not changing anyone's mind.","If losing weight was only a matter of a 'little self care' we wouldn't have the obesity rates we do.

Source: I've lost 109 pounds.  It is not a matter of a little effort.",Not that it is right but some people feel if you don't care about your health why should they. Those people probably shouldn't be doctors but it can be frustrating to see so many sick with things they could prevent with a little self care.,This is called diagnostic overshadowing and it's a real problem in medicine. Also people sadly just don't care as much about fat people.

247,"I found an argument that actually worked and convinced my grandfather.

If Climate Change could be disproven the first one who would do so would get so much money and publicity because he showed what all big oil firms want to hear. Instead every study which ""proves"" the non excistens of climate chance is only shown on a random facebook-page.

Somehow this got through to him because he always knew our country(Germany) would be the first to show this study to everyone, because of our car and coal industry.","This is the same way I feel every time my father sends me the latest ""CLIMATE CHANGE IS FAKE"" article.

Maybe the anti-vaxx parents are terrified that their child may not be lucky enough to be an ASD, and would be willing to do anything to prevent the above? And abusing (imho) herd immunity.

For the record I also have ASD, have been vaccinated, and had a grandmother and great uncle suffer from polio. Grandmother survived the disease, but with long-term health issues. Definitely NOT anti-vaxx. Just thought you should be aware of the mindset that some uninformed parents have so that you may be better able to change minds.


","As I basically said earlier, As someone with ASD I totally hate that mindset. I don't have anything wrong with me, I'm just slightly weird.

260,"Snickerdoodle, those are all little kids. The oldest one is maybe, what, 13? 

I've had meltdowns like the last two videos as well. I made a comic about one of my triggers if you want to see it. I went to a segregated school for about two years and was in special ed for longer. At the segregated school they used restraints and isolation rooms and I can tell you outright they abused them to their fullest. They told our parents it was to ""calm the kids down"" but who the fuck calms down from being forcibly restrained?

 People grabbing their childrens face and restraining them and otherwise antagonizing them for the camera is basically never going to calm someone down when they're having a meltdown. 

There's a huge difference between a 5-year-old with ""~SEVERE~!"" autism and that same adult 20 years later, particularly if that adult isn't isolated and prevented from finding communication methods that work for them.

I mean my special ed teacher tried really hard to make sure I stayed in special ed as much as humanly possible. Any time I had a meltdown or a bad day at school she'd record it. And she'd show it at my IEP meetings. And she'd tell every staff member who interacted with me in the building. She wanted me in special ed for a minimum of 2 hours a day. I have no idea *why* but she did. And she could make me sound like I really had no ability to function at all...all she had to do was spend 3 years taking away every healthy coping mechanism I had (drawing, mild stimming, seating myself so sensory disorder wasn't as much of a problem in class, wearing sunglasses, etc) and antagonizing me and she created a profile that sounded like a very low functioning individual.

then I think of people like my younger brother, who is nonverbal and at one point had and used a speech aid until it was repeatedly taken away because he used it ""too much."" He won't use a similar aid to communicate now. I've found I can draw a flow-chart if I need to ask him something and that works, but imagine how much easier if people had decided they were just glad he was communicating than taking away his talker because he asked for cookies one too many times.

Never ever take those videos for granted that these people are just ""worse"" than you. There's a lot of context you're missing when you watch a 3-minute video of a kid having a meltdown.

262,"ASD stands for autism spectrum disorder and encompasses all degrees of severity, that's why it's called a spectrum. The DSM V rates level of need on a 1-3 scale, with level 1 being something like someone who would have previously been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and level 3 being someone who is completely or functionally nonverbal and can't care for themselves.

I definitely recommend therapy. For your grief regarding your father and the fact your brother will never be the person you need and deserve. 

Also- I hit a very low point emotionally with COVID too. (I’m a psych nurse and we’ve had an outbreak in our locked unit). I posted on Facebook about it too in a vague “please wear a damn mask” way, because I’m fucking alone and sad too even though I’m happily married w kiddos. Covid has taken our normal relationships out of our lives. It’s very hard right now.","I’m glad you got mad and said that.

My tweet was literally like, “My dad died at 6:08pm from COVID. Everything hurts. Please. Dad.” — He said.. “Tell her to take that shit down.” His words echo over and over.

Thank you for commenting. It feels relieving that I’m not alone in being upset over it. Thank you.",All good. I just got mad the way he treated you like that when grief stricken. Sending internet hugs.,"My spouse says the same thing. My brother is older than me by 16 years. Long story short - my dad was married and had his son. A decade and a half later, he met my mom and I was the “accident” child. He lived with us until I was 5, 6 years old. He moved back in with his first wife but they told me he just lived at work. I found out I had a brother and my dad lived with his first wife when I was 11 years old. Anyways, his first wife died when I was 16 and then my parents got back together when I was 17. They are 20 years apart. It’s a weird and strange story to explain but for the last 16 years they have been so happy together. My mom is in isolation right now and completely heartbroken.

I started to ramble - sorry.

I know my brother takes advantage of things and even does it with my spouse (the wi-fi thing as an example). I just have never been close to him and as I got older, I started to do anything and everything to try and become part of his family. When I worked at Disney, I would get them all into the parks. Or if the kids needed photos for graduation, birthdays, etc, he knew I had photography equipment made for weddings. I thought doing all of this stuff would help get us closer. But we are still not close and I honestly think he resents me. I know he does my mother. But I think he resents me too.","> he will come to us if he needs something

That's just another way to say he's a leech.","I know. I got upset when he called my spouse, telling him to, “Tell her to take that shit down right now.” I understand that he wanted me to remove it from Facebook because he didn’t want his kids to see when driving home from work, but I thought since my Twitter was private, it would be okay to turn there for help. My spouse is amazing and listens to me and allows me to vent, yes, but I just.. I was hoping to reach out to anyone across the internet to.. To talk to. I don’t know how to word it, but I think you know what I mean.

My spouse texted my brother after that phone call and tried to stand up for me. My brother is just the very - he has to be in control type. We are not close at all and typically he will come to us if he needs something. His wi-fi isn’t great at his new house or he wants to take the family to Orlando and needs a discount or to see if I had any hook ups (I’ve used hotel points for him multiple times before) or if my hospital has any entry level jobs for one of his kids. Stuff like that. So I probably should have known better than to post on social media. In the back of my head I knew I would get in trouble. 

I’m going to wait until the end of the weekend to post anywhere else. I’m just glad I could post here. It makes things feel less alone. I have a three year old and I have to compose myself as best as I can around him. He grasps some of what is going on.. but it’s hard to explain and for him to understand. So having this safe space and everyones kindness is amazing. Thank you again for reading and your time and everything. Thank you, thank you.","Your brothers behavior is heartbreaking, irresponsible, and downright cold. I'm really sorry, but he doesn't have the right to tell you to take your grief down.

274,That's not much different than telling a woman she has to be a mother because she got pregnant. Both sexes should have the right to chose whether or not they become legal parents,I didn’t say any such thing. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as there’s mutual consent. Just know that it is the woman’s decision to terminate and make your decision to come inside of her accordingly.,But isn't that just controlling people's sex lives by telling them what they can and cannot do in the bedroom?,What a colossal failure of imagination! There’s plenty of sex to be had without ejaculating inside of her.,"Isn't that the pro-life argument? ""Don't have sex if you dont want a kid""",If a man does not want a child then he should never ejaculate into a woman unless he is positive that she feels the same way.,"When there was a vote here for abortion (which was allowed) I thought it was wrong that people OUTSIDE the breeding age (say 45+) could vote. Its no longer their bloody business.

Nobody should be able to stop a woman from choosing to abort, or make trouble for her about it. Its a consequence that will be with her for the rest of her life.

On the same principle, I also believe that if a man does NOT want a child and the woman wants it, then he should be given an option to lose all rights and duties over it - it is equally unfair that a woman should be able to impose such a life-changing consequence upon a man when it is avoidable.","I use birth control because I have tumors growing inside and outside my uterus (Endo).

Just because someone is on pain meds doesn't mean they're a shit person.,"Holy crap, that *is* unusual! Maybe there was a performance review going on while you were there. Regardless of the reason, you had the angels on your side that night.

My husband went in a year or so ago near unconscious, with no obvious cause. He had just been very tired at home, went for a nap, and then was mostly unresponsive when I tried to wake him up. They were sure he had inappropriately used medication at home (he had pain meds and muscle relaxers) no matter how many times I told them he had not and even though his tests came back showing NO drugs in his system. They put him in a room with instructions to the nurse to let him ""sleep it off"". When he started coming around many hours later, he was in terrible pain. As in, screaming, begging me and the nurses to kill him because he couldn't stand the pain, trying to climb over the bed rails, repeatedly passing out. The doctor had the nerve to come in and complain to us about the noise. I begged him, crying, to help and he said, ""He has pain meds at home. He can take them there."" I called another hospital and got them to agree to a transfer, but the original doctor refused to sign off on one. I eventually had someone bring me pain pills from my house, gave them to my husband and then, with two nurses helping me, dragged him to the car and took him home, where neighbors helped me get him into the house. 

He was OK by the next day. I have no idea what was going on, but the experience left us both scarred.",Yes,Was this in the U.S.?,right? its unbelievable how differently this could have turned out,[removed]

278,"As I said above, the idea that ALL Boomers were peace and love flower children and progressives was largely a fiction created through the nostalgic lens of the media. Progressives were a minority then. Boomers of the 60s and 70s largely have continued to vote according to their ideology. On the other hand, younger generations aren’t a monolith either…as indicated by the alt-right.

Someone besides Silents had to have voted for him. Not saying all Boomers but progressives could not have gotten *that* drowned out.,"And that notion that once-progressive Boomers sold out and voted for Reagan is largely false. Most Reagan voters were members of the “Silent Generation”….i.e., parents of Boomers. Also, people tend to think that all Boomers were once hippies and progressives during the 60s and 70s because the media portrays them that way.

You do not win any prizes from your local insurance company for being considered an alive human. Maybe a spam marketing mail. That's it.

Insurance policies are legal contracts, with very clear terms. The insurance company writes up _a contract_ to pay out only if the baby survives the entire 14 day period starting at birth. The insurance company cares zero whether that human is called a baby, a fetus, whatever. It is not eligible for a claim on the policy unless it lives 14 days after birth. End of story.

In these cases I think, ""would I happy if this person lived next door?"" In this case, absolutely not.","Yea I don't want to tell the OP how they should feel, but to be honest with you this is one of the more brutal rape stories I've read an account of from the actual victim. I could see maybe forgiving the friend who sexually molests you while blackout drunk. It's supremely fucked up but if they were drunk too I could maybe see why you might find it in you to forgive (even if I wouldn't). But this was beyond disgusting, it was astonishingly brutal.","Yeahhhhhh there are some people that really cant come back from the worst thing they have ever done. OP's rapist analy raped her, beat her, and kicked her stomach causing her to miscarry her 5 month pregnancy. The utter brutality of the attack leads me to believe that she is lucky to be alive, and that he has absolutely done this before.","> ""we are all more than just the worst thing we've done""

Apply that to Ted Bundy.","It sounds a lot like something Bryan Stevenson, founder of the equal justice initiative has said. I can't recall exactly but he said something like ""we are all more than just the worst thing we've done""","""I do not believe people should be defined by the worst moment of their life""

That sentence really stuck out to me. That sentence can humble a person. Thank you so much for sharing. You're incredibly strong."

Child molestation *is* on that list of certain offenses. Did they collect swabs or the garments that might have that woman's DNA on it?

305,I don't want to leave my religion (roman Catholic) just because theirs is effed. Do I have to be against religion to be against religious abuse?,"OP, I am so, so sorry to hear this. My heart is breaking for you and your kids. 
I’m not surprised AT ALL that they’re IFB (Independent Fundamental Baptist). Child abuse, and subsequent victim blaming, demon blaming, and rug sweeping are everywhere in that group. I grew up fundamentalist too, and unfortunately I know this first hand. 

I’m not sure how you process, but if you want support from a group who has gone through the same sort of religious abuse, try the sub edenexodus. They also have a podcast that I’ve found helpful as I process and heal, so maybe it would help you too. 

You are such a wonderful mom, and I have huge respect for the way you’re protecting your kids. Love and hugs x
I wish I could do more, but you’re welcome to DM me if there’s any way I can support you.","They are fundamental Baptist, and demon possession seems to be the go-to excuse for anything not in line with their unreasonably (in my opinion) hard religious rules they follow. There is no real personal responsibility.","Not heard about the demonic possession (not from US) but the ""hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil"" is recurring theme for many abuse stories alongside with punishing whistleblowers. Alongside with trivialization, victim blaming (stories about children 'tempting' poor priests 🤮, explanation of children enraging parents and 'forcing' them to discipline them etc.). It happens over and over in child abuse, sexual harassment (see #metoo) etc. I wouldn't be surprised if MIL told your daughter that your daughter will get into trouble if she tell you something.","Is this seriously a thing? I don't even know for sure but it never even crossed mind not to believe my child. How could anyone not 100% support their child over an abusive adult!? I guess somewhere inside I know it happens, I just can't wrap my head around it. My kids are always my first priority. Eff every one else.",Sounds sadly typical.,"When the two siblings came forward with allegations as teenagers, they disclosed to their youth pastor. Their father, the youth pastor, and the Senior pastor of the church all were dismissive of the allegations, went so far as to tell the kids they should recant and say they only made allegations because of demonic influences, and then it was all swept under the rug via a strict ""we just don't talk about this"" policy. That's why no charges were pressed at the time, and now the statute of limitations has expired. So I could see some merit to what you're saying given how that was handled.",">Like, I'm seriously trying to think of any way I can justify or defend this. Make it make sense.

I will preface that you need to, of course, do what is best for your children.

As for your husband - I will note that it sounds like he grow up in abusive household and might have been abused himself. He might not remember/believe and not want to remember/believe which is why he forgot to mention it to you - I was abused, though not sexually and not by my parents, in this age and I just remember flashbacks. If my parents tried to convince me that it didn't happened instead of being livid at perpetrator/sorry that it happened they probably could.

I don't know what you should do but I can understand your husband. This is not the same as excuse but it sounds like he needs therapy to come to terms with his childhood. Weather or not you and your children should be there in meantime is another matter.

I'm really sorry for what your daughter and you need to live through. I second u/raaahhhhhh about child abuse therapy."

I’d also file a police report on this.  It may be enough with her pay history to keep her from unsupervised visits.,"I have to disagree with who you responded to. I was abused myself and abuse can effect memory in weird ways.

But all in all, I think Trump got 4% of the Black male vote in 2016 and 8% this year, so in reality, as per usual, Trump is largely a white people problem.",Totally agree.

315,"Thanks for thinking that :)

Context: We talked a bit while hanging out with a mutual friend. Afterwards she found me on facebook, asked if I had anything to do on sunday (ex had broken up with me the day before) and so I said, not really, we could meet up. We talked a bit and I had a looming feeling she didn't ask to meet me bcz she wanted to be just friends, and I was kinda lonely, so I asked that.

Now happily in a relationship since two months. :p",I think that's super romantic and would have loved to be asked like that!,"Sure is.

I mean my journey with my current gf started by me asking ''would you like to cuddle''.

Then again I am on the autistic spectrum so talking straight is my mojo. Yes, I do have a vested interest in all this.","It's definitely happening more now as compared to, say, 50 years ago.","Yeah. In general it would help a ton that we remove the 'playing games' from romance altogether.

A monumental cultural change is needed for that. I shall hope it happens in my lifetime.","it would be nice if the 'moral majority' stopped telling girls to just say no. If we tell girls to say no when they want to say yes, then tell men to just try harder when they get told no ,  you promote sexual coercion. We should not be teaching men that when a woman says no she doesn't mean it, and we need girls to stop playing games that play into that scenario.",Would be nice if the ''hard-to-get'' stereotype just vanished into thin air.,Definitely. Add to that that too many women say 'no...' but actually mean that they want you to put in more effort in pursuing them. The self-aware or insecure guys then tend to play it safe and assume she indeed means no. The impetuous guys then keep pushing and only stop after several no's.
316,"I’m a really tall dude (204cm) and people in school were always trying to convince me to pick up someone else who’s on the smaller side. Like, the one requesting didn’t want to be picked up, they wanted someone else picked up. And I was always like, no I’m not gonna do that. For one, me and that other person are not circus animals to be used to entertain you. Beyond that the other person didn’t ask to be picked up. I have no idea if they’d be okay with that.

There have also been times people have tried picking *me* up just because I’m so large. So they see it as a challenge similar to when they pick you up. So I can definitely relate on that part.","Yup. It started in middle school. We were assigned to be reading buddies for the younger kids and even elementary and middle school kids would all try and see if they could pick me up because I was ""so small"" for an 8th grader. The side effect being I've never felt safe in my body. I didn't break 5' until high school.","Oh my god, that’s horrible! I didn’t realize that was A Thing that happens to petite women. I’m so sorry. It’s such a violation of your autonomy!","This. A man picked me up even when I told him not to, we were ""all friends."" and he was so drunk he fell over. Lucky for him i broke his fall. Unlucky for me I got a black eye and several lacerations and abrasions, and a scar on my face. I can't fucking stand the entitlement some men have just because I'm small. People pick me up as if i were the human equivalent of a chihuahua. I've taken up mixed martial arts and really worked on my ""don't MESS with me"" vibes. But still. Wish i didn't have to. Wish people just respected others space and wishes to be left alone.","Yes! I am a tall, meaty woman. One time one of my friends (a guy about your size) was messing around and picked me up clean off the ground when I wasn’t expecting it. 

I felt real fear. It was a reminder that even though I’m not particularly small, someone could overpower me by surprise, in an instant. 

Thank you for getting it.","I am 6'3 and 300 lbs. I recognize this privilege and I can't even imagine what it would be like to be threatened by someone a foot taller than me and nearly twice my weight, so I'm gone STFU now.","I took a self defense class once and was literally told sometimes you have to ""take the rape"" to get out safely.   It was described as a tool of self defense.  I am really surprised how often men don't understand the reality of these situations.","Having taken a self defense course, specifically for women and in an urban area we were taught in that course that compliance and surrender are also forms of self defense.   This makes me so mad that people can't figure this out.  

You are alone with someone who has obviously no qualms about hurting you or taking what they want by force.  Could I fight? Sure! Is it the best option? Only the person in that situation gets to decide.  

Anyone who has had to physically fight off aggressors (bigger than you) can probably attest to how terrifying and exhausting it is.  That's the truly scary part.

317,"Omg I know exactly this feeling! I've always been a small woman too, didn't hit 5' til I was 15.5 yrs old and hated being picked up at random, especially if the person was tall,I'd 100% freak out. Prob caused by my brother doing that to me off and on and he's a foot taller than me. 

Any way, in highschool at a dance a guy friend, whose a full foot taller than I am, decides it would be a great idea to pick me up. I freaked and literally wrapped my arms around my other smaller guy friend next to me. This dumb ass kept trying to lift me up while I was attached to this other guys neck basically and yelling at him to stop picking me up cause I didn't want him to. He didn't stop til my guy friend told him to stop. No idea why he thought ""hey I'll keep trying even tho she's flipping out and screaming at me!"" was a good plan. This all happened with in like a minute, so smaller guy friend didn't wait long to speak up on my behalf thank god.","Yup. It started in middle school.

319,"As someone from a fucked up family heres my two cents. shes still a bit too young, but in 3 or four years this will be aplicable; dont bring it up first hand, but if she asks, try to be honest without going into too much detail. If the divorce is recent shes still probably pretty raw and desperately trying to find some way to repair things and thats really not the time to bring up stuff like this. But in a few years the most extreme feelings about it have calmed down, she'll have matured quite a bit and when you feel shes ready i wouldnt keep the truth from her.

Of course im not a psychologist so i have no idea if this is truly the best way to go about it but its how i was treated and i will always appreciate it, because i could feel myself there was something not quite right with my toxic family member but I would never have had the courage to distance myself without my grandma being honest when i asked as a teenager cause I wouldve thought it was just in my head and i was acting crazy and dramatic, which i wasnt.",">When he is old enough to understand and process the distress these stories generate in any feeling human being, you should share some of them with him too.

Free the Nipple goes well beyond posting a picture on instagram. It seeks to reject female objectification, and it seeks to put men and women on more equal footing.

Are there issues more important than Free the Nipple? Absolutely! But just because one thing is more important doesn't mean the other thing, then, is completely without merit or value.

Have a wonderful day!","My heart is with the single mother who is struggling with poverty and child care, and the teen who cannot escape generational poverty, and the woman who faces violence by her partner. I can relate to such causes.

Ok, so you don't want outsiders being involved in your problems but you don't like when they become involved in their own? That seems.... contradictory. 

Now don't get me wrong, I personally think things like manspreading are ridiculous and are more someone looking for a problem as opposed to actually having one.

That might be the problem then.

For the most part, in a large portion of Western countries, the major battles have been won if you look at things objectively. 

-Women outperform men in school.

-Women under the age of 30 are typically paid more then men, showing that any earning gap that did exist is quickly closing.

-Men are more likely to be victims of violent crime.

-Men are equally as likely to be victims of domestic abuse.

-Men are equally likely to be raped. 

-Women are likely to be issued reduced sentences compared to a man in the event they commit a crime. 

-Women are overwhelmingly favoured by the courts in custody battles.

-Men are more likely to commit suicide.

-Men are more likely to be homeless.

-Women have far greater access to resources if they are homeless, victims of violence, etc. 

-Men are 90%+ of workplace fatalities/injuries.

So, when both sexes face fairly equal amounts of hardship, the feminist movement (in the West) has had to move on and focus on things that can arguably be considered ""grasping"" for a problem. 

Now, that being said, women in the west do still face hardships that men don't (Abortion and Birth control access being the main one). However, it can easily be argued that men face plenty of hardships that women don't (see my list above). 

This is probably why fewer and fewer ""centrist"" people consider themselves feminists anymore in the West and are beginning to embrace the egalitarian and humanist movements/identities.
","There seems to be a major misinterpretation of my comment/post, although I'm sorry if I did not elaborate further.


There are two major points to clarify: 


Firstly, I did not write the original post to say ""Please, West, *interfere* in our causes"". I never implied or mentioned that anywhere. Where did you get that from? I wrote this in a genuine effort for dialogue and promoting understanding about your perspective because of the disconnect between the South/North. I'm genuinely trying to understand how these causes are considered revolutionary,  because they seem to have strong media presence.  Infact, when I said: 
>It is just extremely difficult to comprehend how these issues are considered revolutionary when there are much more deeply rooted problems, particularly economic and political, that should be at the forefront?


I was trying to understand why and how these causes are powerful when compared to challenges such as female poverty, equal opportunity, domestic violence, rape, lack of political power and so on. From my understanding, despite the progress on these issues, they are still widespread and deeply-rooted in many Western countries. The fight for these is what symbolizes the fight for women, in my opinion. 



Secondly, when I say foreign intervention, I mean when it is foreign governments and men trying to impose their own agenda on us, in the guise of ""advancing women's rights"". That has been our experience - it has not been good. I cherish and appreciate solidarity and compassion from fellow women across the globe, but foreign intervention/influence has been intertwined and tainted with political agendas.

335,"What the fuck I had no idea about any of this, i feel like I just read an episode of Black Mirror. God this is a weird century.","There is a phenomenon that has been developing recently called being a VTuber. This is when a streamer on the internet uses an animated avatar that follows their movement and facial expressions in real time. It allows streamers to perform without worrying about their personal attractiveness and keep other aspects of their personal life private. It also facilitates roleplaying as a character, which is a good fallback for making mild jokes and memes, and creates some interesting variety in streaming content. Finally, it subconsciously encourages viewers to participate more directly with the community and the character - for example, drawing a short comic about an imagined situation involving 2 real-life webcam streamers would be really creepy, but drawing the same kind of comic with two VTubers as characters seems relatively normal, since you're only ""taking control"" of them as characters rather than as real people. Because of this, VTuber communities tend to encourage a *lot* of interaction from their viewerships - for example, many of the bigger VTubers have enough fanart made of them that they can use freely-given, high quality art of their characters made by people in their communities for their Youtube stream thumbnails every day.

There are many, *many* VTubers nowadays: the cost of getting a decent custom Live2d avatar made for yourself has gone down in recent years, to the point that it's now in the same ballpark as a good streaming PC or other equipment, and the experience of being a VTuber is pretty much categorically better than being a real-life streamer in pretty much every regard. The audiences are much more positive and supportive, it's easier to be engaging as a performer when you can integrate little bits of character roleplay, and there's less pressure and entanglement with your real life. Becoming a VTuber in 2021 is an aspiration similar to ""becoming a streamer"" in 2015. However, since it's a very competitive market, many VTubers find it difficult to achieve the level of success that they're looking for on their own, so most of them opt to join a *management agency*, who handles a wide range of behind-the-scenes stuff for them and allows them to simply focus on streaming and making content (for a cut of their profits).

Hololive is the biggest agency known to western viewers, and the second biggest in Japan (where all this originated). Their viewership really exploded in 2020. They now have several individual streamers with over 1 million subscribers each, and the more popular ones regularly exceed 20,000-30,000 concurrent viewers during normal gaming streams. Special events and debut streams can sometimes exceed 100,000 concurrent viewers. They achieved popularity through a few key factors:

1. Although their streamers all have various individual character roleplays, as a company they all have a focus on *being an idol*. This is the Japanese sense of the word ""idol"", which has some nuances to it that don't translate perfectly to an American audience, but if you think roughly Britney Spears but a bit more modest and with more of a focus on being friendly and ""pure"", you kind of get the idea. Anyway, this focus on being idols gives the entire company a strong sense of drive and the impression of being ambitious underdogs, which makes people want to support them, watch them grow, and celebrate every new opportunity they achieve.
2. All of the streamers are on very good terms with each other, and ""collab"" (do streams with each other) very often. This is very effective cross-advertisement, which encourages their individual viewers to become fans of the entire company, and it also gives their streams a great sense of friendliness and variety. This may be especially appealing to viewers who are lonely and/or socially awkward, since it feels like getting to participate in a conversation between friends. Some of the streamers like each other enough to wholeheartedly roleplay as being ""interested"" in each other, and a few have voluntarily become roommates in real life.
3. They happened to hire 2 streamers with particularly strong English skills, who helped build a bridge to English viewers, and eventually laid the groundwork for the company being able to launch a full English branch, which has been incredibly successful.
4. Their communities are self-perpetuating because of the effort and involvement of viewers. As I explained before, the nature of these streamers really encourages viewers to invest their own creative skills into the community; the more this happens, and those high-quality creative works are recognized and signal boosted by the streamer, the more exciting and entertaining it becomes to be a viewer of that community, which in turn draws in more viewers, many of which are talented creators as well, and the cycle continues.
5. Hololive in particular seems to have a knack for hiring very kind, genuine people. If you look up and down the Hololive roster, you won't find a single person who's causing drama, being snarky or passive aggressive, acting jealously, etc. They try to create a supportive, harmonious environment for each other, and serve as role models for their viewers. This is a really attractive form of escapism for people fed up with the cynical, cut-throat society they experience in real life.

Now, the bad side: because it's founded on Japanese ""idol"" culture, Hololive is pervaded with the inherent misogyny of that system. All of the main Hololive streamers are women (there's a separate branch for men that is roughly 1/10 as popular), and their entire business model relies on the type of parasocial relationship that an attractive, charismatic woman can form with a horde of lonely male fans. A great deal of Hololive's income comes from Superchats - stream donations through Youtube - that are given by lonely audience members who just want a bit of attention, or want to feel a bit appreciated by the streamer because of their money. Of the top 12 highest Superchatted Youtube channels in the world, 11 are Hololive streamers, and two of them have earned over $2 million in total donations, in less than 2 years. 

And because of this, to play to their audiences, many of the streamers often rely on jokes and fanservice that you'd think of as intolerably exploitative if it was dialogue written by someone else rather than improv by the streamers themselves - lots of teasing about the size of boobs, questions about the color of panties they're wearing, that kind of thing. And to wrap all that up in a bow, a large confluence of factors - from the friendly, non-critical, non-confrontational vibe that the streamers try to effect in their streams, to the unrelenting competition of viewership and donation numbers, to the company's underlying ownership and control of the streamers' *very identities* - means that it's very likely that any points of discomfort or disagreement between the performers, their management, and the demands/expectations of their viewers will just be swept under the rug and never addressed publicly.

There have been some scandals too. One talent was stalked and sexually harassed by her manager - the company eventually took her side and helped her with legal fees and relocation, but only after it appeared like they were trying to bury the issue for a while. Another talent was the victim of a horrible, targeted harassment campaign by Japanese fans right after she debuted, because she was seen as a ""troublemaker"" or not ""pure"" enough to be an idol, to the point where she resigned in disgrace. What's more, although that person's life was nearly destroyed in the process, it's *strictly not allowed* for anyone in the Hololive community - streamers or viewers - to talk about her or what she's been doing since she left the company (ostensibly, this rule is to protect her privacy, but it also serves to protect the company's interests of severely discouraging anyone from trying to maintain their internet popularity after abandoning their company character).

So, in the end, is it a good or bad thing? Is it misogynistic or empowering? Is it perpetuating the traditionally very exploitative idol culture in Japan, or revolutionizing it? Is it providing comfort to lonely people, or validating their problematic fetishization of Japanese culture and parasocial female attention?

336,"Shit that was a good read man.

Fascinating.","There is a phenomenon that has been developing recently called being a VTuber. This is when a streamer on the internet uses an animated avatar that follows their movement and facial expressions in real time. It allows streamers to perform without worrying about their personal attractiveness and keep other aspects of their personal life private. It also facilitates roleplaying as a character, which is a good fallback for making mild jokes and memes, and creates some interesting variety in streaming content. Finally, it subconsciously encourages viewers to participate more directly with the community and the character - for example, drawing a short comic about an imagined situation involving 2 real-life webcam streamers would be really creepy, but drawing the same kind of comic with two VTubers as characters seems relatively normal, since you're only ""taking control"" of them as characters rather than as real people. Because of this, VTuber communities tend to encourage a *lot* of interaction from their viewerships - for example, many of the bigger VTubers have enough fanart made of them that they can use freely-given, high quality art of their characters made by people in their communities for their Youtube stream thumbnails every day.

There are many, *many* VTubers nowadays: the cost of getting a decent custom Live2d avatar made for yourself has gone down in recent years, to the point that it's now in the same ballpark as a good streaming PC or other equipment, and the experience of being a VTuber is pretty much categorically better than being a real-life streamer in pretty much every regard. The audiences are much more positive and supportive, it's easier to be engaging as a performer when you can integrate little bits of character roleplay, and there's less pressure and entanglement with your real life. Becoming a VTuber in 2021 is an aspiration similar to ""becoming a streamer"" in 2015. However, since it's a very competitive market, many VTubers find it difficult to achieve the level of success that they're looking for on their own, so most of them opt to join a *management agency*, who handles a wide range of behind-the-scenes stuff for them and allows them to simply focus on streaming and making content (for a cut of their profits).

Hololive is the biggest agency known to western viewers, and the second biggest in Japan (where all this originated). Their viewership really exploded in 2020. They now have several individual streamers with over 1 million subscribers each, and the more popular ones regularly exceed 20,000-30,000 concurrent viewers during normal gaming streams. Special events and debut streams can sometimes exceed 100,000 concurrent viewers. They achieved popularity through a few key factors:

1. Although their streamers all have various individual character roleplays, as a company they all have a focus on *being an idol*. This is the Japanese sense of the word ""idol"", which has some nuances to it that don't translate perfectly to an American audience, but if you think roughly Britney Spears but a bit more modest and with more of a focus on being friendly and ""pure"", you kind of get the idea. Anyway, this focus on being idols gives the entire company a strong sense of drive and the impression of being ambitious underdogs, which makes people want to support them, watch them grow, and celebrate every new opportunity they achieve.
2. All of the streamers are on very good terms with each other, and ""collab"" (do streams with each other) very often. This is very effective cross-advertisement, which encourages their individual viewers to become fans of the entire company, and it also gives their streams a great sense of friendliness and variety. This may be especially appealing to viewers who are lonely and/or socially awkward, since it feels like getting to participate in a conversation between friends. Some of the streamers like each other enough to wholeheartedly roleplay as being ""interested"" in each other, and a few have voluntarily become roommates in real life.
3. They happened to hire 2 streamers with particularly strong English skills, who helped build a bridge to English viewers, and eventually laid the groundwork for the company being able to launch a full English branch, which has been incredibly successful.
4. Their communities are self-perpetuating because of the effort and involvement of viewers. As I explained before, the nature of these streamers really encourages viewers to invest their own creative skills into the community; the more this happens, and those high-quality creative works are recognized and signal boosted by the streamer, the more exciting and entertaining it becomes to be a viewer of that community, which in turn draws in more viewers, many of which are talented creators as well, and the cycle continues.
5. Hololive in particular seems to have a knack for hiring very kind, genuine people. If you look up and down the Hololive roster, you won't find a single person who's causing drama, being snarky or passive aggressive, acting jealously, etc. They try to create a supportive, harmonious environment for each other, and serve as role models for their viewers. This is a really attractive form of escapism for people fed up with the cynical, cut-throat society they experience in real life.

Now, the bad side: because it's founded on Japanese ""idol"" culture, Hololive is pervaded with the inherent misogyny of that system. All of the main Hololive streamers are women (there's a separate branch for men that is roughly 1/10 as popular), and their entire business model relies on the type of parasocial relationship that an attractive, charismatic woman can form with a horde of lonely male fans. A great deal of Hololive's income comes from Superchats - stream donations through Youtube - that are given by lonely audience members who just want a bit of attention, or want to feel a bit appreciated by the streamer because of their money. Of the top 12 highest Superchatted Youtube channels in the world, 11 are Hololive streamers, and two of them have earned over $2 million in total donations, in less than 2 years. 

And because of this, to play to their audiences, many of the streamers often rely on jokes and fanservice that you'd think of as intolerably exploitative if it was dialogue written by someone else rather than improv by the streamers themselves - lots of teasing about the size of boobs, questions about the color of panties they're wearing, that kind of thing. And to wrap all that up in a bow, a large confluence of factors - from the friendly, non-critical, non-confrontational vibe that the streamers try to effect in their streams, to the unrelenting competition of viewership and donation numbers, to the company's underlying ownership and control of the streamers' *very identities* - means that it's very likely that any points of discomfort or disagreement between the performers, their management, and the demands/expectations of their viewers will just be swept under the rug and never addressed publicly.

There have been some scandals too. One talent was stalked and sexually harassed by her manager - the company eventually took her side and helped her with legal fees and relocation, but only after it appeared like they were trying to bury the issue for a while. Another talent was the victim of a horrible, targeted harassment campaign by Japanese fans right after she debuted, because she was seen as a ""troublemaker"" or not ""pure"" enough to be an idol, to the point where she resigned in disgrace. What's more, although that person's life was nearly destroyed in the process, it's *strictly not allowed* for anyone in the Hololive community - streamers or viewers - to talk about her or what she's been doing since she left the company (ostensibly, this rule is to protect her privacy, but it also serves to protect the company's interests of severely discouraging anyone from trying to maintain their internet popularity after abandoning their company character).

So, in the end, is it a good or bad thing? Is it misogynistic or empowering? Is it perpetuating the traditionally very exploitative idol culture in Japan, or revolutionizing it? Is it providing comfort to lonely people, or validating their problematic fetishization of Japanese culture and parasocial female attention?

347,"Kyoto Animation is a studio that was originally founded by women doing the grunt work of animation, mainly outsourcing for other ""proper"" studios and slowly worked their way into being a proper studio animating their own stuff in-house. Close to 80% of the workers are still women, and they have made some of the most well known, memorable works in anime. Most of their stuff does a pretty good job of portraying girls and women well. Violet Evergarden is probably one of their best works.

I think there are a lot of studios out there that avoid some of the more problematic issues. It's just cheaper to crank out trash tier series, and there's a massive oversaturation of series these days in the hopes that one will hit gold.","Some is fine imo. Anime is just medium like book or movies. The isekai, fanservice harem stuffs are equivalent to trashy romance lits akin to 50 Shades. They're made as fantasy escapism for certain type of demographics but you wouldn't hate all books just because 50 shades sold millions. 

The problem with anime is part of their society. Japan in general still have problems with sexism and that end up being reflected in their media. 

Another factor is that usually alot of the time, these type of problematic contents are being created by awkward, lonely nerds who rarely talks to women in the first place.

Of all the isekais I've watched or read, Grimgar: Ashes and Illusions sits at the top of my list. Even then, there are fanservicey angles and scenes, but no harem or romantic subplots as I remember, for now anyway.

Ascendence of the Bookworm is one (Female MC obsessed with books), Tanya of the Evil (Male > Female MC), Next Life as a Villainess (Female MC). 

Apart from Re Zero, and Mushoku Tensei, Isekai's are a dime a dozen, and really are not particularly popular.

354,"Just pointing out a response to the birth control failure argument for abortion. I went to a Texan high school that heavily emphasized abstinence-only sex ed and there was definitely implied slut-shaming.

My school also had an on-site daycare for the students, so. 

(Fwiw I am vehemently pro choice and very wary of leaving expensive as hell NY for cheaper CoL red states at the potential expense of my bodily autonomy.)",I'm kinda new to this sub so I'm not really sure how to take this.... Lol,> then you shouldn't have had sex in the first place (you slut),"I edited my comment to reflect what I meant, so to take out the obliterate comment. 

You are correct about the cheap, easy and effective birth control. However, I challenge you to find one that is 100% effective (Except for getting a hysterectomy). Shit happens, birth control fails, condoms fail.","How do you obliterate this argument? There are many cheap, easy and effective forms of birth control available and  not getting pregnant is very easy to do. You literally have to do nothing. ","Oh this is where that fun argument of ""Well maybe she should have realized that having sex has consequences and if she wasn't ready for a child she shouldn't be having sex"". That's my favorite one to talk when debating this with certain people. (I rarely all out fight people about this, I hate conflict)

Edit: I guess I shouldn't have said obliterate, to be honest. Because I can think my points are valid all I want, but usually when I'm debating with someone on abortion, they are so dead set in their ways there is no reasoning with them.","In short, should the rights of a non-viable fetus hold more weight than that of the mother who would be forced ~~to carry it to viability~~ raise the child until approximately age 20 when they don't have the necessary resources (money)?

","The issue is whose rights supersede the others - the woman or the fetus? It then delves into a philosophical and scientific question about whether a fetus is considered “human” or not. Roe v Wade determined, based on science, that it is not until it reaches the stage of viability. Medical advancements have started to shift the goalposts on viability, though it’s still in contention (ie more states are able to pass restrictions after 20 weeks - though the survival rate of a fetus is extremely low, not to mention many tests that determine abnormalities or severe defects aren’t able to be performed until that time which is why you see a push to protect the rights and leave the decision up to the mother and doctor). 
In short, should the rights of a non-viable fetus hold more weight than that of the mother who would be forced to carry it to viability? "
355,"Don’t feel bad at all. You are not an idiot. I didn’t feel comfortable talking about it at first but recently I am trying to be open about it online. 

I am figuring it out and I will be okay. There’s a light at the end. Best case, I’ll be out by Christmas. Worst case, I’ll be stuck here until summer. I WILL get out though and so that little bit of hope is keeping me sane. I do feel stuck and defeated but I also am really really hoping to make it out safe one day soon. 

There are lots of normal shelters and it’s my fault I won’t go because of my dogs. 

I have called some of the shelters near me. There isn’t a way out for me until I get a bundle of cash together but I am working hard on it and I don’t even feel traumatized by it anymore. Just exhausted. 

Please don’t feel bad. I was just hoping sharing would help someone else not get here. Be safe out there, please. *Sends hugs.* 

Thank you for your compassion though. It is very very much appreciated. More than you know. I can’t talk about this to people in real life, so it means a lot to feel *seen* sometimes. Thank you for that. Seriously wish you the best.","I'm so sorry for what you are going through. I didn't mean to make you relive it with my question and now I feel like an idiot for having asked. 

Listening to your story...are there any services that assist women in domestic abuse/violence situations? I know you couldn't just go somewhere else, not with two dogs probably, but anyone with whom you could connect to help you to plan your escape? It just sounds like you are incredibly alone and there should be someone nearby (obviously not another man) who could check in with you, help you with sorting out the next steps...

I don't know if you have posted about this before, but there are women smarter and more informed than I who could also give you advice. I can feel how stuck,  sad, and defeated you feel. I also hear a spark in your voice that is still fighting!

I wish there were some way for him to go to jail for awhile. Just to give you enough time to get away. 

I'm so incredibly sorry. You didn't deserve this. None of the victims of abuse do. You were honest and vulnerable because you wanted to believe in the good in people. I don't know why some people have a radar for good people, vulnerable people, or people who haven't figured out how to set boundaries-- and exploit them. I don't know how anyone could be so calculating. It's sick.","TL;DR: I think it was the way that he was always the injured party. Like now I know he was the perpetrator of abuse for his relationships and also the other woman he had as a roommate. Beware of dudes who seem too kind right off the bat. Too helpful. Sounds crazy, I know. 

When I met him, I had just been assaulted. I talked to him about how I didn’t have any family and how I was scared living in my apartment where the guy had stalked me. He knew I was isolated AND that I didn’t feel comfortable or okay after having to report my harassment, stalking, and assault. I was honest because I am an honest person and I wish I hadn’t told him how alone and vulnerable I was. 

He offered to help. He pretended to be kind. Now, I don’t trust myself or my judgement of people. I am not ME anymore. I feel so so broken. 

At one point, I realized how bad it was when I had to call the cops AGAIN a second time. I tried to leave and he tried to hurt me. I thought I could HELP him somehow. I can’t. 

If all his stories center around him being the one hurt by others and he seems really kind for no reason… It’s probably too good to be true. Real men admit their mistakes, flaws, and areas of growth.

Oh wait. He also called himself “an asshole.” I didn’t see it and I feel SO SO SO STUPID for thinking, “how can you be an asshole when you’re helping me find a new place to live to escape a bad situation?” Jokes on me. He WAS/IS an asshole and he knew I didn’t have anyone to protect me. 

He also asked me how much I made indirectly. Found out how much at work and somehow all my bills at his place totaled that amount. I have no money leftover to leave. He even borrowed money from me just to keep me here I’m pretty sure. 

It started with negging. Out of nowhere, a subtle put down. I told him to stop. He did. Picked up raising his voice around me… to yelling at me. Turned into looming over me without touching me. Flipping tables, throwing stuff, slamming stuff. “Accidentally” knocking me over. Being angry at me for existing, somehow. He didn’t want to be that way. Could I help him? Would I go with him to therapy to explain what I saw? Could I stay because he got fired from work to help with bills? Could I pay for… X, Y, Z and he’d “pay me back” later? Packing to leave, he lost it. Fucking lost it. Shook me like a rag doll and then later body slammed me to the ground. 

Some dude I thought would be safe to live with because he was so big and could *protect me* unlike living with another woman… Became my biggest nightmare. I’m never happy anymore. I hate my life. I wish I had just continued being stalked and assaulted. Living with it had systematically changed my whole identity and I hate who I am now. I don’t wish this on any other woman. I have it all documented for the police for when I leave. 

I’m terrified to leave until I have the money ready to get a place for myself/my dogs and my important stuff hidden away. I can’t leave them with him. I NEVER thought I would be in this position. I would have judged me for not leaving. I wouldn’t have understood how much physical danger it actually is, not being safe at home. How much danger it is even *thinking* about leaving, much less slowly planning an emergency escape. 

I’m not sure there are real warning signs until you start to hear things like “you’re overreacting,” “you’re crazy,” or “it was a joke!” Sometimes someone can seem normal for years and flip. If I could go back, I would have started planning my escape sooner.",That’s a really good point like a crab in water. What warning signs would you tell someone to look out for?,"I’m living with someone like this and I couldn’t listen to it all either. I wanted to watch it all because I feel like it’s important for us to support one another but it was too hard. 

I hate that she hasn’t been able to leave yet. I kept thinking about the boiling pot/frog analogy and I know exactly how she got there. No one ever thinks it could happen to them until it does. I just hope, hope, hope she gets the support she needs so she and her animals can leave. 

There are so few domestic violence shelters that accept pets. I bet one of the reasons she hasn’t left is because he keeps threatening her dogs. I hate abusive people. I wish there was something we could do for her.",Ahh!! Thanks for letting me know about this form of abuse. I definitely was exhausted just listening.,"I can't recall the specific terms but abusers apparently do this in order to intentionally cause mental exhaustion so that their victim is more malleable 

It's hard to defend yourself or feel safe or able to leave when this is constant. And then I'm sure he will love bomb her too afterward so that the drastic shift from awful to perfect disarms her further. 

My heart breaks that she has had to deal with even a moment of this guy","Damn this is waaaayyy too complicated. If someone is playing all of these mind games, it’s time to leave. 

He was annoying the shit out of me with all the yelling, double-talk, circuitous talk, blaming…no one deserves to live like that. I just tuned him out after awhile…I can see why she would too. “Wahwahwahwah” Yeah go fuck yourself buddy."

I'd never actually slept with a man before that night. I wanted sex to be for the people I loved, but the world doesn't always let you live your ideals. I planned to do the minimum necessary to keep afloat financially and repay my debts. But I was blackmailed by my ex into doing it far more often, for much longer, and with people I would have declined as clients. She threatened to expose me to my school and my family. She controlled all the money, and instead of paying down debt she spent it on cocaine. And I fully believed no one would ever consider me as a partner if they knew I had done sex work, and I wouldn't build a relationship while hiding that information.

360,"Yes definitely. I don't know what the answer is either, but to me the glaring issue is also society's view on women. I don't think making sex work legal and regulated is going to change that and instead will only endanger more women since the root issue isn't being addressed by doing that. 


I hope we figure something out soon.","I think it all circles back to purity culture and objectifying women. Certain jobs may be legal, but they still have a negative reputation and are largely stigmatized by the general population. ""You're a model? That's so cool! Oh, you're an OnlyFans model? Slut."" ""You're a dancer? Wow, what kind, ballet? Stripping?! So you sell your body to strangers."" ""You're an actress in minor films?! That's awesome, what kind of films? Oh, porn?""

I don't know what the answer is, but as usual, nothing will change until society's view on women does, because a guy who has a lot of sex is a player, while a woman is a slut or a whore.","But there is already a lot of sex work that isn't illegal (like OF, stripping, porn) and it's still such a huge problem. I just don't see how further supporting this would change anything.","THIS! When sex work is decriminalized & made less stigmatized, it opens up ways for SWs to take legal action against clients who mistreat them. People are financially abused in many different jobs, sex work just makes it a different kind of awful.","Or, you know, the fact that it's criminalized in any capacity (legalization requires some aspects to be made illegal) makes it impossible to have labour standards set by workers?

Decriminalization fights human trafficking.","How many times have we heard that OF is more ethical because women can do it all themselves? If there’s a way to exploit it, someone will find it - it’s really naive to think everyone is doing it through choice.","Incidentally this is my problem with the sex industry generally.

361,"It's complicated. For instance [this study ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12001453#:~:text=The%20scale%20effect%20of%20legalized,are%20favored%20over%20trafficked%20ones.) Found that legalizing sex work increased human trafficking. The demand for sex workers outpaced the ability to supply it through legal means. Whether legalization actually decreases human trafficking (a claim made flippantly all the time) is far from a settled matter. It needs more research but what we have currently indicates the opposite. 

I did an analysis comparing the impacts of legalization, decriminalization and criminalization of sex work. All have their various pros and cons. And as others have already said even among the cohort who ""want to do it"" there's a lot of different reasons. Examples: I want to do it because it's the only way I can afford to eat. I want to do it because my boyfriend really wants me too. I want to do it because it's the only way I can get my heroin at a discount.

 Like the reasons for ""wanting to"" aren't always free of coercion or positive which is why ""choice feminism"" can be lacking in its refusal to analyze what influences people's choices.","But there is already a lot of sex work that isn't illegal (like OF, stripping, porn) and it's still such a huge problem.

I, and any other open-relationship people I know aren't there for you (not YOU, the general you) to lie and cheat.  We have rules too.  Rule 1: Don't be a piece of shit and fuck up a closed relationship.

Like, holy crap! gingery. It's been doing great things for me lately with post-Covid ick.

If you can get ahold of Ginger People products (sold on Amazon and elsewhere), those are also fantastic. They have ginger juice and a bunch of different candies of varying intensity. Also excellent for motion sickness, btw.

Tomato soup (cheap-ass Campbell's condensed) and iced tea with lemon wedges will also do the trick. That little bit of acidity will often cut the nausea a little.

I also find myself turning lately to pho with lime squeezed in as a good, soothing remedy, for the same reason as the above. Get it delivered, or do up a pot yourself (I use Jet Tila's quick recipe and mod it to make it easier, so I don't have to go to the grocery--let me know if you want my mods).

Also, if it sounds good, try eating it. Your body may decide ""I can make this one thing work,"" so give it a shot. Make sure that you're getting *some* calories in (if all you can handle are milkshakes, well, sounds like you're drinking milkshakes) and are staying hydrated.

It doesn’t seem to be about her not noticing sooner (and honestly this could have been a really really rapid change for him anyway). It seems to be about having emotions about the situation to begin with. Which just doesn’t make sense because it’s such an awful situation.,OP is having a lot of guilt issues. I hope she will see a therapist before it starts to be a negative in her life.,Why are you ashamed of having a good long cry? This sounds like anyone’s nightmare to have their spouse in such decline at such a young age. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. But there’s *nothing* to be ashamed of. ,"That's what the counselor said. It's scary, I mean, he's only 35. To think that he could be like this for another 30 or more years? I'm ashamed to say I had a good long cry.

Bills. Oh God. A week before the baby was born we bought a new Tahoe. 72 payments. I wanted a new car to go with the new baby. There was NOTHING wrong with my old car. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

We're still paying on his truck. The mortgage. Credit cards. Tool payments. The bills from the baby haven't come yet. We're going to have bills from this. We have insurance but the copays and deductibles are high.

It's very serious. This will no doubt affect my husbands ability to even hold a job. Just from talking to his boss they're already bending over backwards to keep him working. There is not much more they can do if he gets worse.

I can't replace my husband's $28 an hour job cashiering at Walmart. So, yeah, this is going to have serious ramifications.

We'll get a definitive diagnosis at the advanced neurology center early this week.","What you’re describing sounds very serious, and you might need to start calling in some help from friends and family. You mention in a response here that family lives far away, but this sounds like something that you may be unable to deal with on your own and you will need resources to help your husband, care for your new child, and come up with a long term plan for how to manage this. Sometimes you have choices to involve family members, and you’d rather not if they are far away, and sometimes you don’t because the issue is serious enough that they need to be there. This may be one of those times.

It sounds like your husband’s physicians have an idea what’s going on, but maybe haven’t made a final determination or disclosed their suspicions to you while they wait on testing. It might be beneficial for you to sit down with a neurologist one-on-one and make them explicitly spell out exactly what they think is going on with your husband, as well as the long-term ramifications and progression of his diagnosis. Make sure to ask them what the ramifications of a diagnosis might be on your husband’s work and life long term. This sounds very serious, and you are going to need all of the information available to make good choices. 

Some of the responders here are attributing the problems you describe to “lack of sleep” or other more minor and temporary issues. However, the symptoms and history you describe also bring up the possibility that this may be a more serious chronic health diagnosis. 

No one here can help you troubleshoot what is going on, as this will be something that needs to be done by your husband’s specialist physician—likely the neurologist. This is far above Reddit’s paygrade. 

I’m being repetitive, but I can’t stress the importance right now of cornering your husband’s medical team if you need to and making them tell you what’s going on. Bring a trusted friend or family member with you, record or take notes, and make them repeat things that don’t make sense. If this turns out to be minor, great, but if it’s not, you will want to know now so that you can plan instead of being blindsighted in the future. 

I don’t want to scare you, but I don’t want you to miss necessary information because you are unaware that people are treating you with kid gloves. Hopefully I’m wrong and that’s not the case."
427,"just carry bear spray, and if asked explain just say you had an uncomfortably close call with a bear before and just carry it as a precaution and heep it on you so you dont forget it.","Well, it is nuanced in a pretty twisted way.

Self-defense (when life is under immediate threat and withdrawal isn't possible) is a legal defense practically worldwide, and certainly in every US state.  In fact, it's an Internationally recognized human right, and a human rights violation to deny.

**But**, the right to improve your odds of self-defense prior to being assaulted isn't universally accepted.  That's what varies and yeah, it's in her interest to know what she's allowed to say about anything she's carrying that could be used to better her odds of survival should she be attacked.

Deeply fucked up.","Oof that is super fucked up. 

Yeah this is really dependent on the country and state where op lives as the US is so wildly different with their laws. Some states have stand your ground laws where others have much harsher gun laws. Honestly if op would be willing to give a general idea of where they are it would change advice but for now as a woman in the Eastern US I would recommend getting a license to carry and taking self defense classes alone with adopting and training a dog if possible. Cameras and pepper spray are great too.","Same in Canada.  Even the smallest woman with active stalkers threatening to rape and/or kill her has committed an offence that can send her to prison by carrying defensive weapons like mace / pepper spray with intent to defend against another person.  According to the law, it is her legal duty to not carry any object with the **intent** of using it as a defensive weapon for any reason - even out of reasonable fear of a sexual assault or attempted murder.

If you're carrying anything in defense that could be construed to be a weapon - a knitting needle, for example - it's important that you **never** tell anyone it's to protect yourself.  That makes it a weapon.  *Using* a weapon in self defense is a right protected by the Charter, but being in possession of one is not.

More on topic, you *can* carry pepper spray intended to be used on animals.  But if you ever get stopped by the police and say ""I'm just terrified of being raped,"" then you have admitted to a crime.  I'm sure it's similar in some US states.

If anyone's interested, [Runkle of the Bailey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99EBOF7sFQA) is a Canadian lawyer who's covered this issue extensively.  Might be similar in some US states.

*edit* I want to add ... I am a lifelong Liberal/NDP supporter and have no interest in firearms.  I am a fairly large man and can defend myself without a weapon.  This is not my axe to grind.  I just find the situation *deeply* disturbing.  I believe it violates the Charter because I am entitled to more self-defense capability than smaller people, simply by virtue of my biological size and strength.","That is not true. If op is US based it’s illegal to carry pepper spray in many states, I can’t speak to other countries laws but if ops life is in danger and they’re carrying a licensed firearm then they would be able to claim self defense. 

Hopefully it would never come to something like that but knowing how to safely use a firearm is very helpful","Yes, but with pepper spray, you can't be charged with attempted murder, and you can carry it with you everywhere, unlike a firearm.",This is untrue. Pepper spray needs to be aimed and can also hurt the person spraying it (depending on wind and other factors obvi) and isn’t always going to stop someone. It’s good to have some but a firearm or dog would be a safer choice.,"Guns take time. Pepper spray you can usually get immediately. And, you don't really have to aim pepper spray."

It was zero fun but at least in my case karma got them as they ended up in a car accident later that night where the cops who attended found the spray and matched their car to my and my room mates description of it.","Same in Canada.  Even the smallest woman with active stalkers threatening to rape and/or kill her has committed an offence that can send her to prison by carrying defensive weapons like mace / pepper spray with intent to defend against another person.  According to the law, it is her legal duty to not carry any object with the **intent** of using it as a defensive weapon for any reason - even out of reasonable fear of a sexual assault or attempted murder.

If you're carrying anything in defense that could be construed to be a weapon - a knitting needle, for example - it's important that you **never** tell anyone it's to protect yourself.  That makes it a weapon.  *Using* a weapon in self defense is a right protected by the Charter, but being in possession of one is not.

More on topic, you *can* carry pepper spray intended to be used on animals.  But if you ever get stopped by the police and say ""I'm just terrified of being raped,"" then you have admitted to a crime.  I'm sure it's similar in some US states.

If anyone's interested, [Runkle of the Bailey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99EBOF7sFQA) is a Canadian lawyer who's covered this issue extensively.  Might be similar in some US states.

*edit* I want to add ... I am a lifelong Liberal/NDP supporter and have no interest in firearms.  I am a fairly large man and can defend myself without a weapon.  This is not my axe to grind.  I just find the situation *deeply* disturbing.  I believe it violates the Charter because I am entitled to more self-defense capability than smaller people, simply by virtue of my biological size and strength.","That is not true. If op is US based it’s illegal to carry pepper spray in many states, I can’t speak to other countries laws but if ops life is in danger and they’re carrying a licensed firearm then they would be able to claim self defense. 

Hopefully it would never come to something like that but knowing how to safely use a firearm is very helpful","Yes, but with pepper spray, you can't be charged with attempted murder, and you can carry it with you everywhere, unlike a firearm.",This is untrue. Pepper spray needs to be aimed and can also hurt the person spraying it (depending on wind and other factors obvi) and isn’t always going to stop someone. It’s good to have some but a firearm or dog would be a safer choice.,"Guns take time. Pepper spray you can usually get immediately. And, you don't really have to aim pepper spray.",Do this. Get a gun. Take shooting lessons. Get a large dog.,"Check out /r/homedefense. They have great advice for anything related to well home defense. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this, especially without police.  Adding i see other suggestions of pepper spray, I suggest gel pepper spray. Same thing but it sticks where you shoot it. So if you hit someone on the nose, mouth, eye area it stays in place. This prevents you from getting hit as well as more time to flee a bad situation."
429,"> I don’t know why one would assume someone is standing behind the door racking it over and over and over to intimidate

I think you're giving people far too much credit","I didn’t miss the point. There is no need to rack it multiple times, I don’t know why one would assume someone is standing behind the door racking it over and over and over to intimidate…and if you have the ammo, loading a shotgun is not difficult to do. I would assume one would have knowledge on how to operate their weapon before whipping it out to defend their life with it.","I think you missed the point.  He/she wasn't talking about having an unloaded gun.  If you weren't aware, racking a shotgun will eject any shell that is chambered.  So if someone racks gun several times with the intention of intimidating an intruder, they might eject all of the shells in the gun and not have time to reload if the scare tactic doesn't work",That problem is easily solved: have ammo. I don’t know why anyone in a life or death situation would have an unloaded firearm as a deterrent…,"Until you hear them rack it 3 or 4 times and realize they have no ammo. Someone not experienced with guns may think ""if I keep racking it, they will think im more serious"" and either eject all the shells or show that it's not even loaded.","I agree, you hear someone load up a shotgun and it works like a rattlesnake rattling its tail. “There is naught but death for you here”","It is literally one of the most distinctive sounds in the world.  I did say that in a dumb way, the sound itself is not a deterrent, but it can definitely give someone pause, as well as pump action having the advantage of not needing to spoil your aim while racking a round, unlike a pistol or traditional rifle.",Using the sound of a shotgun as a deterrent to a home invader is the most dogshit advice ever pedaled.

433,"Former Haligonian... I sometimes feel like the Atlantic Provinces are the ""rural area"" of Canada. With other resources (money and jobs) concentrated in other parts of the country, the East Coast loses out on essentials like doctors. When I lived in Halifax (for about 8 years, after moving from *actual* rural NS) I would have to travel the hour to my hometown to see ""my"" doctor because I couldn't find one in the City.

About 6 years ago I moved to a northern city. The population of this ""city"" is a fraction of Halifax, but because there are so many well paying jobs up here, it really draws people up. I haven't had any problem finding a doctor. Sure, there are fewer people here in general. But I would argue there's a greater concentration of doctors here. Especially young doctors recently out of school looking to pay off student loans. There's also a much shorter wait time of you go to the ER despite there only being one hospital. 

I don't think universal healthcare is the problem in Atlantic Canada... I think it's a combo of the aging population/ high student loans for young professionals/ lack of well paying jobs to pay off those student loans. ","I'm in an urban area.  Halifax, the largest urban area in my region actually.  So that's not an excuse either.  ",Universal healthcare doesn't cause this problem. Distribution of resources and where healthcare providers want to actually live does. I'm from a rural area originally. General practitioners are scarce there.

435,"Oh ffs your misrepresenting the situation to the point you might as well be lying then. 

Halifax and the atlantic provinces in general has both an aging population and young  professionals not staying. This means that the number of new GPs in the province has not being going up, while the number of people who need access to GPs to manage chronic conditions has been going up. As well as current GPs retire, their patients need to find other primary care physicians. 

What this means is that the waiting list is not agnostic. People with chronic conditions who really need access to a primary care physician are getting placed on the list before you. 

That's got fuck all to do with universal healthcare and more to do with the fact less people want to work and live in atlantic canada in combination with the aging population out there.

446,While laziness is definitely a factor (particularly when it comes to women) let's also not forget the horrific staffing and overwork issues in and around healthcare in general.

That was her 3rd time in the E.R as well. She didn't have insurance so getting into a specialist was a whole other challenge but I think after like the 6th E.R visit she finally got a recommendation.  Unfortunately they also misdiagnosed and it took another few months to final figure it was cancer. 
 
Thankfully she's doing better now, after colon removal and a colostomy bag . It just makes me rage how complicated and sadistic this Healthcare system is.

455,I agree and I think coming to terms with certain types of past actions are harder than others. We all want to see ourselves as the protagonists of our stories. It can be a massive identity shift to accept you have caused someone harm on that level in your past.,"I think you're right.

It can be frustrating to make an effort to change and then hear that you're part of the problem after making that effort to change. I don't know if you can ever totally get rid of the bad influences, maybe just learn to recognize it and try to act differently? Either way, some people find it hard to come to terms with their past actions. 

It can be hard to step back and realize that these conversations are not an attack on men. This subject is mostly talked about in a negative light, which can initially make it feel like it isn't constructive until we realize how important it is for women to be able to share these experiences and for others to read them and see that this is a real problem that exists in our world. Women are just sharing what they've experienced and venting their frustrations. Men do the same thing! 

Mostly, I think we all just need to drop our egos, listen, and learn from each other.","I honestly think this is why the very defensive “not all men” attitude is so prevalent. I think there are many men who suspect they may have crossed a line in their youth and feel a bit defensive. 

Idk I just know most times ppl get super defensive is because they recognize something in the critique they don’t want to admit is true.","I bet you're right! 

Most if not all of the men I've known grew up with a culture that centers around objectifying women, myself included. I want to say it starts around puberty, but it's probably younger. We learn to channel our attraction and sexual urges in ways that are hurtful towards the women we desire and damaging to all of our relationships with women, even if they're platonic friendships. 

Some boys realize its unhealthy and wrong, usually in their mid-twenties, but some never do. I'm not sure if it's social change or maturity that shifts that mindset. #Metoo started when I was around that age.

I could totally see how both dads could think about how they acted when they were younger, because it's so common! I cannot think of a man I've known who hasn't shown some of that behavior or acknowledged that they did in the past. 

I'm convinced the only way to stop it is for men to purposely change their culture. How we view and talk about women shapes how the next generation will. We have to learn it from somewhere, because little boys certainly don't objectify women from birth. That behavior is learned. Respect can be too.

458,"Oh, for sure! Education is a stepping stone in that path. I didn't mean for it to sound like I disagreed with adding education, just that I think it wouldn't solve the problem alone.

I would guess that a big part of what has helped me is listening to the conversations surrounding the Me Too movement. That was part of my on-going education and we never had these conversations in school. Maybe if we had a critical thinking class discussing gender issues, I would have realized my mindset was unhealthy sooner? I hope so.","I agree with that. I still think some standard class to make the standards known makes sense. It doesn't solve the issue of course, it's more to fill gaps that fact that common decency doesn't mean universal decency. Sometimes we have to come right out and explicitly tell kids what is right and wrong and why sometimes.","It's a cultural thing for men. There's not a class or a thing my parents could have said that would have made me act better when the hormones kicked in. I wanted sex all the time and would go to extraordinary lengths or put up with almost anything to get it.

Men in my life always objectified women, which led to me doing the same. Family, teachers, strangers, other boys my age, media...they all influenced how I viewed and treated women, but it wasn't a conscious decision to do it. That's what was normal.

We would talk about ""that fine piece-of-ass"" and even came up with code phrases we could use to say these things to each other in public and not sound creepy to an outsider. None of us were violent, all of us knew about and respected consent, but we were still acting in damaging ways that were unhealthy. 

It's a culture, not just an education thing. We knew it was wrong, so we hid it from women. Maybe the education would have worked at a younger age, but once puberty set in, it was there until I made an effort to change myself and grow. 

Men need to take responsibility for changing how they view and talk about women or this will never change. How we act shapes future generations because kids pick up on it too. Women can help by teaching men and influencing media, but at the end of the day, men need to step up and own changing our own culture or this won't stop.","Heck make it more general then. It's not sex ed it's respecting boundries class.

Imagine if sensitivity training or a class on sexual harassment was mandatory.",No this point of view is not the problem. You’re right that victim blaming is not a good solution but the person was just expressing how helpless they would be to protect their daughter.

That woman, Alyssa Golob, scares the shit out of me, tbh.

I like Trudeau and I don't understand what you meant or what Ben Mulroney has to do with...anything. Isn't he just the host of some TV show?","There are some nutbar extremists in the Conservatives (sorry, the Conservative-Reform-Alliance Party, or ""CRAP"") who still agitate for that, but anyone running for the conservatives in a non-rural non-backwater (where most of the seats are) knows damn well that restricting abortion is the kiss of death for their political career, and as the anti-abortion types age out of the population (yea, Covid for the assist!) the younger generation is even more committed to the status quo. Polls in Canada have consistently put support for free abortion around 70% of the population. Unlike the USA, you can't run the country with a base of 30%. If they think the Catholic Quebeckers will back anything, keep in mind - Morgentaler started his clinics in Quebec, and as soon as the more progressive PQ took over, they dropped all prosecutions of him. More and more of urban Canadians are immigrants from non-Christian countries that really don't care what the Bible says about life.

BTW, I voted for Joe Clark at his last leadership convention. Mulroney cured me of conservatives.  I used to suggest that ""the sins of the father should not be visited on the son"" but I was willing to make an exception for Justin Trudeau and Ben Mulroney. Now I only hold things against Ben Mulroney. 

And in fact, Exodus 21:22 -   
> If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  

Basically, causing a miscarriage is a property crime (against the husband), not a murder. Pay a fine. Some argue this means if the baby is born OK - but if this is the case, if all men did was bring on a (safe) labour, why would this be even mentioned in law? And how often would hitting a pregnant woman cause a safe delivery? ""Mischief"" is taken to mean injury to the mother.  This logic that miscarriages are not murder is why many Jewish doctors (like Morgentaler) do not have a problem performing an abortion.",">The Conservative party is smart enough not want to touch the issue with a ten-foot pole.

Umm...no, they’re not. They’re trying VERY hard to take us backwards, using the fact that we have no laws about abortion to do it. Oh lord, it scares me that you don’t know how hard the anti-choice groups are trying to weasel their way into politics... and they’re succeeding! We need to remain vigilant.

The current Conservative party is not your “Joe Clark” conservatives. They’ve been taken over by the Reform/Canadian Alliance/extremist branch. I say this as an Albertan who watched it all happen.","Here in Canada there has been no abortion laws for decades. back in the 90's the more conservative provinces were hoisted on their own petard, so to speak. They mandated abortions only happen in hospitals, to prevent freestanding clinics. Some hospitals the doctor evaluation committee rubber-stamped requests, others (particularly backwater ones) never approved anything. The Canadian Supreme Court said that since health care was a government service (all procedures in hospitals are paid for 100%) that it had to be equally available to everybody the same. The two sides in the debate in parliament could not agree on a compromise legislation (surprise, the anti side would not vote for a law that permitted any abortions) so the deadline passed with no replacement, constitutional law. 

The only requirement in Canada is that if the fetus is born alive and dies, it's murder. So logically, only medically very (very!) necessary abortions happen after the 5th month.  But otherwise, it's strictly the woman's decision... as it should be. 

The vast majority of Canadians don't want this changed. The Conservative party is smart enough not want to touch the issue with a ten-foot pole. We look south and wonder WTF is wrong with the USA - but that goes for politics, guns, and health care, not just abortion.","I live in Texas. It's already kind of a reality here. The TRAP laws they passed when Obama was still president (that provided the precedent Roberts used to deny Louisiana its own TRAP laws) eliminated a lot of abortion clinics. And they have not come back, even though the laws were struck down years ago by the Supreme Court. TRAP laws have been instituted across a lot of states.

I'm in West Texas and the nearest clinic is over 300 miles away. So either in DFW or El Paso (both on opposite sides of the state) or I can go to NM, Colorado or Oklahoma. The fact that it's about the same distance to a clinic in Oklahoma as my own state is hilarious to me.

Here's another one: https://globalnews.ca/news/5799732/canada-anti-abortion-activitists/

That woman, Alyssa Golob, scares the shit out of me, tbh.

I like Trudeau and I don't understand what you meant or what Ben Mulroney has to do with...anything. Isn't he just the host of some TV show?","There are some nutbar extremists in the Conservatives (sorry, the Conservative-Reform-Alliance Party, or ""CRAP"") who still agitate for that, but anyone running for the conservatives in a non-rural non-backwater (where most of the seats are) knows damn well that restricting abortion is the kiss of death for their political career, and as the anti-abortion types age out of the population (yea, Covid for the assist!) the younger generation is even more committed to the status quo. Polls in Canada have consistently put support for free abortion around 70% of the population. Unlike the USA, you can't run the country with a base of 30%. If they think the Catholic Quebeckers will back anything, keep in mind - Morgentaler started his clinics in Quebec, and as soon as the more progressive PQ took over, they dropped all prosecutions of him. More and more of urban Canadians are immigrants from non-Christian countries that really don't care what the Bible says about life.

BTW, I voted for Joe Clark at his last leadership convention. Mulroney cured me of conservatives.  I used to suggest that ""the sins of the father should not be visited on the son"" but I was willing to make an exception for Justin Trudeau and Ben Mulroney. Now I only hold things against Ben Mulroney. 

And in fact, Exodus 21:22 -   
> If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  

Basically, causing a miscarriage is a property crime (against the husband), not a murder. Pay a fine. Some argue this means if the baby is born OK - but if this is the case, if all men did was bring on a (safe) labour, why would this be even mentioned in law? And how often would hitting a pregnant woman cause a safe delivery? ""Mischief"" is taken to mean injury to the mother.  This logic that miscarriages are not murder is why many Jewish doctors (like Morgentaler) do not have a problem performing an abortion.",">The Conservative party is smart enough not want to touch the issue with a ten-foot pole.

Umm...no, they’re not. They’re trying VERY hard to take us backwards, using the fact that we have no laws about abortion to do it.

464,"Happy to hear that :)

It’s a wonderful book and I hope you (and your partner) get out of it what you’re looking for!","I found you aswer more than satisfying, thank you. I think I’d be able to cope, it’s been a long time so my injuries have healed for the most part 😊","I can’t confidently answer that question, as someone who’s never been assaulted, but I can give you a sense of how she handles it.

Chanel Miller has a wonderful ability to express the horrors of her case in a vivid, infuriating, moving way, while managing to throw in just enough humor and tangents to keep the book engaging and readable. Whether that humor is for the reader’s sake or her own is unclear (perhaps both).

She chooses not to dwell on physical specifics purely to dwell on them; details are revealed sparingly and with purpose. The book is more about her emotional trauma and healing over time, and how the assault and the court case consume her life and the lives of those close to her (until they no longer do). She writes about how she learns to cope with herself and how to share her experience with others. She also writes about how those processes are not and may never be complete.

So, TL;DR I can’t promise you that you’ll feel safe reading her book. But I do believe she wrote it with other survivors in mind.",He does like to read! I’ll recommend it to him. Do you think it’s a «safe read» for me?,"If your boyfriend likes to read, I’d recommend Know My Name by Chanel Miller.","I was raped at 18 by a boy in my dorm. I was suicidal at the time and had enogh to deal with. I had no idea where the nearest rape centre was. My boyfriend doesn’t understand why I didn’t press charges against him, and we always end up arguing if this comes up. He won’t try to understand how hard it can be, and it’s infuriating. Thank you for saying this, I feel like my feelings are finally validated.","*if you feel like you can.

Pressing charges like this is a huge ordeal for the accuser. I never did because I knew it would destroy me.",Some states have elongated the statue of limitations on rape. Please look it up for your state and press charges if you can. He deserves to be behind bars.
465,"The principal is Karen Taylor. She's a real gem, for sure. 😒 She's covered up dozens of SA.","Of course she'd advocate for him. She's the one that'll get in trouble if the boy gets charged. Stupid self-serving a-hole

Edit: my bad for assuming gender","Sadly, the principal advocated for him at the grand jury, and they decided not to move forward with the case.","Yep, doesn't matter. This dude is clearly extremely dangerous and needs to be designated as such by some governing body in order to prevent this from ever happening again. A jury would be told to take into account the mitigating factor of him being special needs, if he is. He needs to be a registered sex offender.",It doesn't matter. He should still be charged. No he will probably not be convicted but his family and the school have to take responsibility for the behaviour and for neglecting their duty of care towards the girl. This is almost guaranteed not to ne the first time for that boy. The family clearly has let him learn from porn or his behaviour would not be so highly sexualised.,Am I reading it right that the boy was also disabled?,"This type of thing has been going on at this school as long as people can remember. I know two girls personally, who were victimized by a teacher and one girl who was raped in an underground cafeteria when I attended, I'm class of 97.","Look up the Glen Ridge NJ gang rape case from the late 80's - It's a horrible but fairly well-known story. They even made a TV movie about it. The group of boys were popular athletes and the girl was a low IQ special needs girl that they took advantage of - it was going to be swept under the rug until the story was leaked to the media who finally broke the story open. Simply horrible - they tried to claim it was consensual.

Using media pressure is a smart tactic - sometimes you have to pressure and shame folks into doing the right thing."
466,"Couldn't it also be argued that it's a 2 person job to begin with? If he's to be supervised all the time ans one has to for example go to the bathroom, what are they supposed to do, drag him along?","Exactly. I spoke with another female student who volunteers in the SPED room. She said he made advances and when she declined, he harassed her and threatened her with violence almost daily after that. She also said it wasn't unusual for him to be running around unsupervised. The ""teacher"" of his sped room was often taking off and leaving the kids on their own.",The actual fuck.,"What's worse is that he's supposed to be supervised at all times, especially when walking through the halls. He was gone for AN HOUR and nobody noticed.",">”We want the rapist arrested,"" said Janie’s mother. ""They’re saying **this is part of his disability.** What disability makes you rape? Girls aren’t safe in this school. We’re exposing them.""

If this is true then why the fuck was this kid going to a school with other kids? That just makes it more horrific knowing they allowed him to enroll in the first place, didn’t adequately supervise him nor Janie, and continue to let him go to school. 

Fuck these people.","Oh, I’m not saying the boy doesn’t deserve to be brought to justice. I’m just wondering if that was a factor in the grand jury not continuing the case. It doesn’t make sense either way, but it would probably help comprehend the situation.",It doesn't matter. He should still be charged. No he will probably not be convicted but his family and the school have to take responsibility for the behaviour and for neglecting their duty of care towards the girl. This is almost guaranteed not to ne the first time for that boy. The family clearly has let him learn from porn or his behaviour would not be so highly sexualised.,Am I reading it right that the boy was also disabled?
467,"What do you expect. “Boys will be boys”. It’s ingrained at a young age. If a young girl is bullied by a boy, it’s “because he likes her”. The girl is taught that behaviour is normal, and the boy learns that he can get away with it",Agree. They teach us how to stay safe but never teach boys to leave us the fuck alone. Unfair.,"Completely understandable, I guess it’s just kinda shit that women are told all these ways to stay safe when it should be potential attackers being taught to not do that. I have had to cross the street to get away from a group of men but it was also broad daylight at least","I guess I disagree with that because I'd rather cross the street and put distance between us and if this shows my awareness of my environment maybe an attacker would be less likely to target me and look for someone more oblivious. I'll zigzag all the way home and have done this, frankly.","Just to clarify, are you saying this as a man trying to be clear you mean no harm? That’s definitely not a bad idea. As a woman I get told to cross the street if I feel unsafe, but also told that crossing the street only shows the big scary stranger just how scared you are making them more likely to attack. It’s good fun being female","I cross the street, if I can. Use the other sidewalk. I'm not trying to get bear maced by a stranger because I walk too quickly.","I feel like that’s something where each individual has a different opinion on what feels safer. If a guy were trying to walk past me at night, I’d be fearing that they’re trying to catch up to me for other reasons. However I also understand that if they were to hang back it would make a person feel like they’re being followed. Kind of a tricky situation to find the perfect answer to",This isn’t directly related to your post. But why on earth do people keep parroting the idea that if a women is walking alone at night a man should hang back to avoid making her uncomfortable? That would make me nervous AF. Men are taller than I am. They take bigger steps than I do. Catching up to and passing me is normal and expected. Instead of lurking at a distance like a shadowy creep why not just walk past me? Lingering is unnatural and unnerving.

I’d probably handle it by saying something like “I was very disturbed by Tyler’s actions last night. From my perspective, I think he assaulted you. If you need any kind of support - I want to be there for you.” 

She may react by laughing it off or simply say that she wasn’t assaulted and you were mistaken. You can say something like “Okay, I’m sorry I was mistaken. If you ever want to talk about this further I’m absolutely here for you but I won’t bring it up again”. And then go to a space of your own and process your own trauma. She may not be ready to process this right now, she may need to define this without using terms like “assault” or “victim” bc she is triggered by other past traumas, she may be lying to you and seek out help from someone else later but regardless your role as a friend here is to BELIEVE her when she says what has happened to her. Center her agency so that she has a path to recovery. 

Seek out your own peace friend and give yourself grace. It sounds to me from your other comment that you witnessed something traumatic and you probably reacted out of that trauma.

Obviously I'm not advocating for debasing a person by equating them to their sexual value. I am saying that we ARE STILL CAVEMEN when it comes to primitive mating instincts and NO ONE should feel ashamed about sexually fantasizing about other humans.

Sexual thoughts are NOT perverse","We aren't cavemen. Reproduction for us now includes mental and emotional aspects as well as physical.

If Joe Shmoe or Jane is literally subsisting off my body and possibly causing me major psychological distress and a risk to my life, then yes? It hasn't been legal to own someone else's body since 1865 in the US, and I don't see why it should start now.","I feel like the “abortion is murder” argument absolutely *has* to prohibit abortions for rape and incest in order to have any moral ground to stand on.

The bill itself will not allocate funds to purchase formula from out of the country, because we can't due to Trump Era trade restrictions. It also won't be used to get the Abbott plant running quicker because it is already going as fast as possible and more money won't help things go faster.","How will the money be used to address the shortage?

To my understanding, the shortage is due to the shutdown of the Abbott plant, which happened for legitimate safety reasons.

I was very aware when I started trying for kids that I might need abortion as healthcare at some point to save my life. I wouldn't have undergone pregnancy in a state where the failsafe of abortion wasn't  available in case things go south, ergo, my husband and I would have moved. That would have meant the loss of two fully qualified lawyers for that state.

This is particularly true for already marginalized groups -- unhoused, substance abuse disordered, poverty, elderly, etc.. That is just one example, though -- there were plenty that I feel caused a lot of harm and took away privileges that were bordering on taking away items from the hierarchy of basic human needs.

That isn't to say they weren't necessary; it's just that when public understanding and when science changed, we didn't update our approach. We let mothers birth alone. We let people die alone. We isolated our elderly and vulnerable in long term care centers to their rooms for months, not allowing social interaction beyond brief changes.

For example, as I understand it, there is zero legal problem with stuffing the supreme court. It's been the general understanding that you don't do that, and to some degree for good reasons, but it's not illegal.

Now imagine a world where the supreme court tries to enforce theocratic rules on a population that's, I dunno, 70% atheists, 25% super-liberal christians/muslims/whatever, and 5% extremists. Do you really think that that society will simply wait for judges now on the SC to die, and to just accept (and implement) all the oppression dictated by them in the meantime? Rather than do the obvious and find whatever loophole there is to stop what almost everyone among the population and representatives agrees is abuse? Like, say, appointing another 10 sane judges to the supreme court so that the religious nutjobs can be ignored?

That's really my point: If there is a consensus in the population that theocracy is not acceptable, then formal rules won't be able to overrule that. It ultimately doesn't matter that some rule says that people need to be oppressed, when people generally disagree. A few religious nutjobs ultimately can not force a whole nation to obey their rules. You always can start declaring their nutjobbery as terrorism and then remove judges from the bench for being members of a terrorist organisation. Or whatever.

But when you truly feel deep down inside that the problems can't be fixed then there's no point in trying. And I do think it's supported by reality. The Trunp administration absolutely stacked rhe most important courts with young extremely radical judges with lifetime appointments. Congress is useless, it's the courts where the real change is. The Supreme Court only hears a small handful of cases a year, the vast majority of established law goes through the lower appellate courts, where they are now overly stacked with young extremist activist judges. And there won't be progress there for 70 years until they all die out. By that time I will be dead, and so will many of the users here. Yes I know I'm being doom and gloom but it's truly how I feel. The only way to fix things is to burn it all down and start over from scratch. But since that isn't going to happen I've given up. So have many of the people i know","I hope you realize that then you are part of the cause of that happening, right?

But also, I think that view isn't really supported by reality. Consider that there is a quite significant imabalance between older and younger people when it comes to conservatism, and in particular when it comes to religion. While that means that it could be a slow-ish process, it seems pretty much inevitable that with old people dying, they won't be able to hold on to power, even with all the tricks that they are using.

Also consider that atheism is the fastest-growing category of ""religion"" overall.

They are fighting tooth and nail, but overall, I don't think that they are winning, despite the occasional horrifying setback.","Then you and your ancestors are a better person than I am. I'm at the point where I feel that it's truly hopeless. There is no way to fix or improve anything. The country is a stage and we're burning down the theater with everyone inside. You just gotta grab a beer and watch it burn. This country is doomed. But hey, I'm glad there's people like you who will fight the good fight.","I don't believe in giving up.

I wouldn't BE here, if my ancestors just had of ""given up"" and lost hope when it came to slavery, being considered to be THREE-FIFTHS of an entire fucking person, and so much more.","Or, alternatively, you think it's all hopeless and pointless for everyone so why even bother any more and have just gave up.

508,"I’m terrible with no sleep as well, thankfully my partner stepped up regarding that. That’s honestly such a selfless thing to do, best of luck to you!","Yeah I'm a monster if I don't get 8 hours of sleep. It wouldn't be fair to me or a baby to not have me operating at full capacity.

We've talked about fostering teenagers about to age out of the system that just need a safe place to be themselves when we get a bigger house and that appeals to me WAY more than having a newborn lmao","same, my eldest son is six and he’s so much more fun and interesting now. I put up with the baby bit to get to the latter stage, but I totally get why some wouldn’t want to as it is stressful imo.","Yes!! Exactly!! 

We obvi don't/won't have kids, but my spouse is WAY better with babies than I am. I'm 28 and had never held a newborn until my niece was born 2 years ago, and then never held her again until she was \~6 months. I like older kids that you can chat with and joke around with them.","Exactly, if you aren’t willing to be an equal parent you shouldn’t be one. I’m a bit of an outlier in that I’m not traditionally maternal and prefer older kids to babies (if I could’ve given birth to two year olds, I would have) whereas my partner is more “warm”, and so maybe that worked in our favour as the traditional gender split just didn’t appeal to us.","You are not the first person I've heard say that and I guarantee that you won't be the last! 

I get that moms are going to have more biological pulls to parenting, but partners who don't go out of their way to try and make the experience as equitable as possible shouldn't be parents in the first place.","yes, I think so much gets lumped on women as part of “childcare”.

Ive been flamed for this before but one of the reasons I didn’t breastfeed was because I didn’t want to be the sole parent in charge of feedings. Kids have two parents, either of us can feed them.","Yes! Some of the most intelligent, driven, gorgeous, angellike women that I know have the WORST husbands and deal with it because it's easier than doing it alone. It breaks my heart.

As for the childfree folks more equal at home, I think it's an equalizer to not have children. Both of our careers are equally important, the household stuff has to get done still, and we don't see anything as ""our"" tasks. I think it can pretty easily gravitate with parenting (that I've seen) to a ""well you chestfeed, the baby likes you more, etc"" that allows dad to push off responsibility."
509,"It’s not rubbing salt in the wound. You don’t need to treat everyone with kid gloves. Saying to someone actually you are a powerful person and you don’t need to take this shit, look at him, what is he bringing to you? Isn’t judging them.","Then why are you belittling them, saying ""well, how could they miss all the obvious signs and keep churning out babies? Why am I seeing all these posts? Why can't these women just NOT, it's NOT hard.""

It's backhanded and toxic. Women don't need to be told they were wrong, they have been told that at every turn of their life. 

If you really want to get the message out there, stop ""making sure"" to tell them. Listen to women when they start bringing up these signs and then say ""hey, you know that's not ok?"" 

Women need people to listen to them and not rub salt into the wound.",That’s why I’m saying we need to tell and show these women that. I am not looking down on them. I’m saying we need to make sure the message gets out there to them,"SOME women know that. SOME don't tolerate that. 

Most women do NOT know that. They know what their mothers or friends go through. They have no clue that it's not okay or if they're suspicious that it is not, they get told that they're being a nagging bitch. 

The response you're giving is toxic and elitist feminism. You're looking down on these women who got scammed by society and scoffing at the idea they could be so naive.",No it isn’t. Women do have to know that they don’t have to tolerate it. Even if you think “that’s just how men are” guess what…you don’t have to date a man! You don’t have to date anyone!,"That is victim blaming though. 

Society has made ""incompetent man"" an acceptable husband and to be expected. There are no movies where men do laundry or wash dishes (unless because he has to). There's no ""hey, let's get men to take care of kids!"" standard. 

A lot of women are told ""that's how it is"" from day one and it's just part of the package. 

Hubby don't want to pick up after himself? Oh gosh, your father never picked up his socks in 30 years we've been married! Hubby doesn't get up for nightly feeding? Yeah, my hubby never does either but he is tired a lot and...

If you're taught that, surrounded by that, reinforced by that, and never shown differently, how are you supposed to know? 

I was raised by a feminist, but it took me well into my twenties to realize I am not responsible for any man's emotional burden and I am not supposed to fix him. I am not even married!","Surely there’s signs beforehand, that he can’t operate a washing machine for example, or that he never cooks. And surely once you have one baby with them and see what an idiot they are, why would you stay and why have more?

Agree that internalised misogyny needs to be discussed.","Yes but you’re assuming all women know that their partners are going to be incompetent assholes going into it... You do understand that plenty of men will put in an act while dating, talk a big game about what a great dad they’ll be one day, and then pull a complete 180° the second they’re married or some not until the kid is there and it’s way harder than he expected? 

Like..I’m with you to a point, yes lots of women put up with things I personally never would and I think there need to be more discussions about our internalized misogyny and why these things are accepted. 

But you never once mentioned how sometimes well meaning women become trapped by these men who are often (borderline) emotionally abusive..or how we are told that these man-child relationships are cute and relatable, or how these men went their entire lives acting this way and society as a whole allows men to be lazy and it’s considered endearing….how women are socialized form birth to be caretakers and it makes sense that many feel responsible for a man’s feelings since we are constantly told we are responsible for men’s feelings??

Your post assumes that women are all knowingly choosing to be with a partner who won’t care for them and it’s pretty damn condescending."

It is so ridiculous.  I always comment that if they don't trust the medical professionals they themselves were seeking help from that they needed to do everyone a favor and deliver the baby themselves at home.  Don't put others at risk because of your selfishness.","My mom is an RN at a hospital (postpartum care) and it's infuriating hearing some of the stories of people there. People who don't want to wear masks, people who are irate about the one visitor policy, people who think it's all made up. Meanwhile, she's had four positive patients in the last six weeks and it takes her 30 minutes to get in full PPE to tend to the patient and the amount of heartbreak she sees these moms experience because they've never seen or held their newborn because of a positive test is difficult for her. It amazes me how absolutely idiotic people are.","I will never understand the profound disrespect people have for people in the medical profession right now. 

My mom is an RN, half her office is out either positive or awaiting test results, and patients are coming in with their noses out and trying to take their masks off during exams because ""it's all democrat bullshit anyways"" while my Mom and her office are putting themselves on the front line. 

It's infuriating and I'm sorry. Grief is natural to have and at some point, the wife will have a /r/LeopardsAteMyFace moment and realize that she and her husband both contributed to his early loss. 

Rant when you need, I can't imagine working in the ICU.

My mind just like, broke for a second. I had been talking to myself out loud, but like, that's not that weird. Definitely not as weird as what he's doing now. I deadpan stared and said, ""yeah I'm fine"", and he turned around and got back in his car.

Any doctor who insists on doing so is not following current guidelines, nor evidence based practice. 

The reason many doctors ignore these guidelines and require these exams anyways to prescribe contraceptives is quite literally because of, ""the prevailing view in the profession that if women could get their pills without a prescription, they wouldn’t come in for annual checkups."" This is a common symptom of the paternalistic view of women patients.

There’s hard data to prove it. An interesting article on this topic: [Many doctors are denying birth control to those who won’t take cervical screenings — even though it’s not medically necessary](https://theestablishment.co/bargaining-with-my-birth-control-2a2de4e49172/index.html).   

FYI to any American women who are reading: **Pap smears are only recommended every 3-5 years**, depending on age and history. [This](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/03/14/148520621/doctors-revamp-guidelines-for-pap-smears) is an article from 2012 when they changed the guidelines, but it talks about how overtesting results in unnecessary treatment that can cause complications and problems for women down the road. 

TLDR: Evidence shows that annual pap smears can do more harm than good, so the ACOG changed their pap recommendations accordingly.","Well woman exams and Pap smears are vital parts of preventative healthcare. Saying there is no reason for a healthy woman to have a pelvic exam is untrue, please don’t spread that.","Yeah pelvic exams aren’t even required. Hell, unless you are having a pelvic problem, there is no reason for a pelvic exam period.","I am super weirded out now. I couldn't get the simple bc pill because my gyn insisted on a transvaginal ultrasound which I refused. I did consent to the pelvic ultrasound though, insurance covered it so why not? 

It's even more frustrating because that was the only doctor I saw that was willing to prescribe bc at all.","Yeah US doc here. Never heard of such a ""requirement"".

561,"> But Putin's choice to aggressively enter the Ukraine was not just a result of his authoritarian regime. It was a result of a long disputed trade issue that ended up with Russia being backed into a corner in 2014. Putin's support of Trump is based on all of this.

The number one reason Russia was being backed into a corner was its neighbors and most of the Western world have no love or trust for authoritarian Russian governments. Putin doesn't need to expand militarily into the rest of Europe if he can just switch off their gas to get concessions. For the same reason, any other moves he makes to increase Russia's own power or weaken the states around him ultimately have the effect of projecting that power farther into Europe and the rest of the world. It's not like the economic dispute takes place in a vacuum.

There's one other possibility you're ruling out. Trump has been soft on NATO in public. If vacationing Russian soldiers turned up in one or more of the Baltic States, and they call for help, and Trump doesn't fight back, that's it, NATO's broken. Russia becomes the dominant military force in the region. Again, it doesn't mean there will be Russian tanks in Berlin the next day, but that's because he doesn't need to invade everyone to dominate them.

Putin wants to be stronger than everyone around him so that when he *does* want something, they give it to him or are unable to stop him from taking it. Most of the countries around him want something better than USSR 2.0 so they keep trying to block him.

I'll only add that I admire a lot about Russia and hoped they were on course to slowly come together peacefully with Europe despite their internal setbacks, until they turned back to armed force to advance their goals. And now they've bumped Trump into the White House. It's a sad state of affairs.","The US backing down in Syria would allow Russia to have a navel base located within the Mediterranean which allows it to flex it's military strength a lot more. This is concerning.

But Putin's choice to aggressively enter the Ukraine was not just a result of his authoritarian regime. It was a result of a long disputed trade issue that ended up with Russia being backed into a corner in 2014. Putin's support of Trump is based on all of this. 

The result of the recent election will potentially mean that the US will back down in Syria and Saudi backed pipelines will no longer attempt to supply Europe via Syria. Russia will have no need to push into bordering EU countries if they secure this deal with Trump.","> Europe's dependence on Russian gas is vital to Russia's economy.

That also gives Russia significant political leverage on top of its military strength, leverage it's never been afraid to use over weaker states. Understandably, EU nations, particularly in Eastern Europe,  would prefer a US-EU energy supply over a Russian one.

There are no saints in international politics, but Putin's responsible for bringing armed conflict back into Europe after a long period of peace. His domestic rule is firmly authoritarian in the same direction Trump's campaign rhetoric pointed. He's not the kind of leader whose freer neighbors would feel comfortable trusting him with their own futures.",Becuase the EU and the US have been throttling Russian gas trade. Europe's dependence on Russian gas is vital to Russia's economy. Disputes between Ukraine gas pricing (backed by the EU) prompted this push into the Ukraine. This is also part of the reason that Clinton and Putin are so involved in Syria. The plan was to completely remove Europe's dependency on Russian gas by building pipelines through Syria.,Mmm I wonder why Russia is so friendly with Trump. Maybe because Trump will allow Putin to further press their way into Eastern Europe. ,"Not really - once the Trump supporters get a taste of actual Trumpland, they'll be clamoring for impeachment.

There is a risk of retaliation, but it somewhat depends on what information you gave them already. If you didn't leave your name or address, then there's almost no chance of it happening.

Of the credit card disputes I've been involved in (which admittedly isn't much), there hasn't been any retaliation.

Further, from a merchant's perspective, it kind of doesn't make sense to retaliate. The money's gone.

The MUA/pinterest complaints are very valid though. If they want to charge premium prices ( which they do) then they have to provide a premium experience.

Here's the quote that everyone seems to notice: 

>women rate an incredible 80% of guys as worse-looking than medium.

Here's the *entire* rest of the point that everyone seems to miss:

>when it comes to actual messaging, women shift their expectations only just slightly ahead of the curve, which is a healthier pattern than guys’ pursuing the all-but-unattainable.

Women message men at a rate that's on a pretty realistic bell curve, even though they're not ""rating"" them as highly. It's MEN who only reach out to the ""hottest"" women.

And just another big obvious point: look at the ""average"" women's pics in the post. They're posed. Well lit. The women are wearing nice clothes. An effort was made. The photos are showing these women at their best, they're flattering.

Look at the example men's pics in the post. One has red eye ffs. They're not posed or well-lit. Only one out of four comes close, in my opinion, to showing how attractive that dude probably is IRL.

What this ACTUALLY shows is that women do not think men's *profile pictures* are very flattering. 

And I'd ask anyone who's ever glanced at a dating site, do you honestly think they are? Do you think men usually put effort into their pics?

More like they use that as an excuse not to put in the work.  

I get it, it’s difficult to put yourself out there.  Maybe you’re shy or lack confidence, maybe you have a hard time with all this.  But again, that’s when you ask friends for help.  Or family.  If you don’t have anyone in your life that supports you, you may be a lovely person but you need to work on developing your interpersonal skills before you get yourself into a relationship.  

But most guys are just being lazy.  Maybe it’s 30% fear, 70% laziness.  And it can turn into this angry ‘take me as I am’ kind of attitude.  One that extends to the rest of their life.  Chances are they don’t exactly take much time to clean their house.  Or themselves.

I didn't think that was a high bar, but I am clearly wrong (and should feel bad).

So maybe this is actually representative? I agree, I'm not surprised women are turned off by it.","I’ve always thought this about dating apps, that someone who puts minimal effort into his profile is going to also put minimal effort into a date or a relationship .

Once again for the folks in back: *other men shaming you is not something women can solve, so leave us out of it*","I didn't blame anyone for it.

OP asked the best way to approach the problem and I answered what and why.","Who shames them? Because it is not women who do that. And if men are shaming men for their sexual success or lack thereof this is a massive you problem that we cannot influence in any way externally. And we categorically not going to offer ourselves to prove a point. We are not playthings, we are people.","Getting involved earlier + empathy. Unsuccessful men get *hardcore* shamed, just think of the comment 'why can he get a relationship but not me?' for proof of that. That shame disincentivizes them from asking people for help, so they search for it on their own, and find incel/redpill because there's nothing else to find online.","This is kinda the problem.

But the split is being incorrectly applied to real life spaces and toxic masculinity is ascribing toxic feminity traits to women as a whole group.","So if toxic masculinity influences male dating strategies, and toxic fenininity influences female dating strategies.

Expecting men to perform sexually at the drop of a hat. Shaming men for sexual inadequacy.

Expecting men to pay for them and give them money.

Causing arguments and expecting men to defend them.

We live in the most privledged time in history. The advent of birth control has given women freedoms they could never have imagined a generation before. Women often didn't want the right to vote as it came with a responsibility to enlist.

The issue with modern society is we want freedom without responsibility.

There is a large focus on toxic masculinity in the public discourse. Could I ask, what do you think is toxic femininity? And how does it play into our culture?","I get your point but those roles weren't taken away, they became superfluous.

When women were able to vote, work, own property and generally have rights, they no longer had to rely on men just to survive in society.

Over the last 70 years, the classic role of man providing for and protecting his family has become outdated but we're still preparing men for this role.

Thus there is a huge dichotomy between what men are told they should be versus what women require of them.

It's this dichotomy, coupled with toxic masculinity and a general insecurity which causes men to question their place in society. And why they want women to roll back the clock to an earlier time when the roles men were groomed for are relevant.","It's not about data though, it's about a large subset of men who are trying to find meaning. The roles and jobs which gave their forfathers meaning have been taken away, and the family unit, the thing men would stoicly endure suffering for, is a dying phenomenon. 

We need to move away from us vs them (groups), towards the original us vs them, family."
615,"Aswell, we are discussing a natural phenomenon called hypergamie. Where women typically want men who are higher in wealth and age. And men typically want women who earn less than them and are younger.

The advent of online dating had increased the perceived potential candidates for women. Instead of perhaps 100 guys in the local area, they can go on social media and find the attention of millions, and head to dating apps being selective (3% yes) and still matching with 20 guys a day. Men and women are two parts of the whole.

Over the last 70 years, the classic role of man providing for and protecting his family has become outdated but we're still preparing men for this role.

Thus there is a huge dichotomy between what men are told they should be versus what women require of them.

It's this dichotomy, coupled with toxic masculinity and a general insecurity which causes men to question their place in society. And why they want women to roll back the clock to an earlier time when the roles men were groomed for are relevant.","It's not about data though, it's about a large subset of men who are trying to find meaning. The roles and jobs which gave their forfathers meaning have been taken away, and the family unit, the thing men would stoicly endure suffering for, is a dying phenomenon. 

We need to move away from us vs them (groups), towards the original us vs them, family.","That this data is clearly not true: there are many men and women in relationships, thus for it to be true, you have to ignore the fact that people are obviously dating. 

That they need to go out into the world and actually go into spaces where women and men co-exist to see it for yourself.

That women are not a hivemind and you have to treat them as the individuals they are. 

I could go on but most of it boils down to ""Get off the dating apps, go outside and actually talk to real people."""

620,"Love how you can speak for all men and putting down ""women like me"" for having reasonable standards and trying to fear monger me for the time I get older. What are you projecting onto me?

There's a multitude of reasons for men or women being single or not. Ever thought that more older women are single by choice because they prefer it that way because the relationship before wasn't working anymore and men stay in the relationship because it benefits them more emotionally?

There are multiple variables playing into this. Women also tend to live longer than men, among the single women over 65 are most likely also quite a lot of widows. How does the percentage of single people say anything about their desirability anyway? There are people who are desirable, but who are still single. Some people just get into relationships out of fear of being alone or for stability.

I don't even actively date at my current age, so if I were a guy, my life would pretty much be the same because I don't date either way. Or at least I'm not actively looking. 

I've seen so many socalled average Joes having girlfriends and being generally quite successful with dating. And no, they're not the top 10% of men, they're your everyday guy from next door that don't really stand out from the mass, but they found someone that matches them.

It's usually the ones being insecure or having poor social skills who might have a depressing experience with dating, men or women. Or they just had bad luck.

All I said was that you shouldn't depend your happiness on a relationship and this applies to every sex and you're coming with statistics to proove that women become less desirable among the broad mass, even though no one was talking about this.
My point still stands regardless.
It's far more complicated than ""young women are too picky because they're still pretty and have more options until they get older"". Numbers are not telling the whole story.","What exactly implies that I think too high of myself? Because I said that I enjoy my own company and don't let myself pressure into a relationship? Please.
Also since when is online dating reflective of the real world? Tinder works much differently than meeting someone in the real world and most people only use Tinder for hookups anyway.
It could be that women's desirability on online dating declines more after a certain age compared to men's desirability, but why would I care? I don't use online dating anyway and when I'm older, I don't want anything to do with men in their midlife crisis who look for women the same age as their daughter or niece.
Like if less men are into me when I'm older, it doesn't matter because it only takes one person to click with for a relationship. Quality over quantity.","Girl even in online dating it's show women have much much steeper decline in desirability compared to men their age .that women when they are in their 40s men start becoming more desirable than them in dating(if you want to me to link the studies I can do it.they are reliable they have 200k big ass sample size)

This literally online dating the platform that women 90%  the power in dating.

I actually think older women are extremely attractive I don't believe this incel rehotic that women age badly .

But ask in guy in their 30s and tell them how dating was in their early 20s and they probably will have PTSD from how young women pickinees.

. I agree with all your statements and I don't side you friend but you seem to think too high of your self because you think you're independent women who enjoy her time alone. But let's be serious try being average Joe in his  20s and let's see how you respond to loneliness and singleness.

TLDR:  I agree with you in everything in this post but I still think you're pretentious young beautiful woman who say that she enjoy being single and say ""singleness isn't bad"" because she has power in dating over men because she is attractive young women. 
That why I'm telling you get old and let's see how you respond to singleness when men start being picky.","Don't even try the old ""hitting the wall in your 30s"" line like women turn into ugly hags the day they turn 35, that's bs.
Men have their right to be picky as much as I do and if they don't want me, they don't want me. If I don't want them, I don't want them, simple as that. There will always be people willing to date, no matter at what age and if an older guy only wants to date younger women, so be it. You say yourself they're apparently shitty, so why would I want to be with them then? If a man in his mid 30s has unrealistic expectations, that's not a man, that's a manchild.

Eh, he looks alright, average, I'd say, but not my type at all.

>Is he trying to be your ""nice guy""?

I hope not, and I don't have a bf.

>How's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' POV? Where is him empathy?

He is able to understand others' POV, but when it comes to this topic, he has tunnel vision, unfortunately. Usually, he is kind, takes care of his friends, is considerate towards everyone. It's not as black and white and it seems like once the topic of being alone is mentioned, his inner demons come out. I understand your sentiment though and appreciate your empathy with me! I'll set much stronger boundaries with him for sure.","How's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' POV? Where is him empathy? Is he physically attractive? He literally treats half of the population as subhuman. Is he trying to be your ""nice guy""? Do you have a bf? Once you have a bf, he probably will be mad at you, disappear and talk smack behind you.","Oof you read him like an open book 😅 

He is pretty much looking for someone doing the emotional labor. During the conversation, I felt like he was dumping all his sorrow onto me and I could just try to shield it off of me, without any consideration of how it makes me feel when I try to encourage him and he just keeps wallowing in self pity.

I mean I don't think he's deliberately trying to manipulate, but more or less subconsciously. But I think you're right, I had a similar talk with him this summer and what triggered it was that while we were talking about the topic of dating and whether love at first sight is a thing or not, I said that attraction at first sight is definitely a thing and that I do pay attention to the way a guy looks and the way he carries himself.

Meaning I want to be physically attracted. I didn't mean I want my man to look like some sort of model, just someone who I find cute in his own imperfect way. Of course personality is important, but I do need that attraction, the chemistry. Not that much of a revolutionary concept, isn't it? lol To him it apparently is.

It could very well be that this completely normal statement made him mad because it showed him that women care about more than the bare minimum and are not as desperate as him. Just like with my best friend ""Emily"" from the post, just hearing that a woman is also able to be happy without a man made him bitter enough to react like that.

Coming to think of it, he is talking a lot about financial topics and his plans in that regard and is always talking endlessly about the details of a certain topic that could have been compressed into one or two sentences (to a point where no one is even really listening anymore because no one cares that much) and to lowkey try to impress people with his intelligence.

The thing is, apart from that he's a good guy, but he has a crap ton of issues he needs to unpack, but he doesn't realize that. Otherwise he's fun to be around but whenever that topic comes up, it's exhausting. I feel kinda torn because I don't want to ditch him as a person completely, but if he keeps getting on my nerves like that, I have to ask myself if I want to keep hanging out with a guy like that or have an honest talk with him. Because dating wise, I'd never entertain a guy like him either.","He sounds like a typical low emotional intelligence guy to me. Instead of working and self reflecting he just continues the denial and it snowballs into inceldom. 

Men like this are desperate because they’re relying on their partner to fulfill a lot of their needs. Self acceptance, stability.. sometimes even entertainment. So not having a partner is just him bouncing to one side of the room to the other because he can’t work on his own self acceptance or entertain himself properly. He desperately doesn’t want to be “alone” because he dumps basic human needs on women. It’s like walking around with a huge basket of dirty clothes and crying that you need it washed asap (only by a woman) because you never bothered to learn how to do it yourself. 

These guys also love to strategize relationships because they don’t see the other gender as an equal. It’s always a red flag when someone is ok with potentially “manipulating” their way into having and maintaining a relationship. Like pick up artist culture. 
Of course he is not going to like women having their own standards and wanting to be with attractive men.. that means he can’t control or manipulate them into dating him. They use money/income, social status, “intelligence” as date baits and it’s pathetic.

I don’t think it’s worth the time and effort to deal with these guys anymore, seriously. They’re tricky and insecure enough to try to bring you down with them."

Sure we get a sliver of progress every so often (gay marriage... And.. Umm....) but for every one of those, you get a tidal wave of regression.

The worst of it is that progressive ideals and policies would truly help 90% or more of the country, but democrats pursue these things so poorly that a substantial number of people fight it tooth and nail, and a large chunk of people who would be for it are so unenthusiastic about it that they don't give it a second thought.","Presidential power is fairly limited in the grand scheme of things.

>I always have a pretty good hard separation of people I can see having friendships with and people I'd have a sexual relationship with

I can understand that. To me though, the possibility is always there. I don't really picture a romantic relationship as a sexual relationship though, the sex part of it is more of an ""add-on"" but I also view sexual relationships a bit different than normal, like I'm perfectly fine with my romantic partner having other sexual partners so long as they're only sexual partners, meaning no going on dates, etc. That's definitely not the norm though.

I guess you can say that I compartmentalize the different aspects of a relationship and am capable of viewing them more individually rather than entirely holistic though they are obviously all connected in a relationship as well.

Idk, people are weird, man lol.","You didn't word it bad, I misinterpreted your words. I meant to come back to it after I re-read it, got a phone call, got distracted, here we are lol.

>Whether you like it or not, from the very second you meet someone your brain is already trying to figure out where to place them in your hierarchy of relationships. 

Not necessarily. I tend to go into all relationships as friendships. But that's a me thing, as I'm not really interested in romantic relationships. I always have a pretty good hard separation of people I can see having friendships with and people I'd have a sexual relationship with (and of course there's overlap there, FWBs etc.). But I guess I'm an outlier in this; I know my disinterest in romance isn't the norm, I accept that (also I'm a widower. I just have no interest in ever being in a romantic relationship with another person)",">So, as one guy to another, I gotta say..your mindset might seem innocent but it genuinely seems like you're getting into friend groups in the hopes of romantic encounters developing, with people who aren't aware of this (but who might suspect it) and that isn't really fair to the people who just want their friends to be friends. Honesty goes a long way my dude.

But this is kind of an ""unwritten rule"" dictated by human nature. You don't start off loving someone, you *fall* in love with them over time so naturally you're most likely to develop feelings for people you spend the most time with, ie; people within your friend group.

>The issue with your stance of ""building friends groups of potential partners""

I thought I clarified this pretty well, I don't build friend groups of potential partners and I certainly don't add people to a friend group solely because I view them as a potential partner, I add them to my friend group because we inherently connect as friends, meaning we have commonalities in our likes and dislikes and our personalities seem to mend pretty well. Most people wouldn't be friends with someone they have nothing in common with and can't stand their personality.

A recipe for a good friendship has tons of similarities to a recipe for a good romantic partner which is exactly why people tend to develop romantic feelings for someone within the friend group.

I might've worded things bad in my last comment, but I don't go ""I haven't tried a relationship with Mary, let's give her a shot because we work together well as friends"", it's more of being cognizant of the feelings that are organically devolping (or not).

Whether you like it or not, from the very second you meet someone your brain is already trying to figure out where to place them in your hierarchy of relationships. This is constantly being evaluated and adjusted on a per person basis typically based on shared events with said person. Now who do you have the most interactions with, thus the most likelihood of their position being adjusted in your hierarchy? That's right, your friends.

Because of this, there's always an inherent potential of developing feelings for someone within your friend group. Which is why it's pretty ridiculous to verbally aknowledge the disclaimer of ""hey, I don't have feelings for you right now and I may never, but there's always the possibility that someday I might"". Like that is literally the case 100% of the time.","The validity of your point is directly proportional to how honest you are with your intentions. The issue with your stance of ""building friends groups of potential partners"" is are the potential partners willing and consenting participants to your goal of basically trying to find a partner within a friend group ?

Like, people get into relationships with their friends. Shit my friend group's relationship rate is a bit redonk, but we're all nearly 40 and have known each other since high school for the most part, and while some have dated others (repeatedly over the years lol), but there's an honesty there. But when you get into a new friendship - anyone, man or woman - there is usually an undercurrent of wondering on intentions (especially on the women's part) and it's important to be clear in that regard. So many women feel blindsided and manipulated by who they thought were friends, real friends! Who it turns out they wanted more. They never lead them on, gave them any indicator, but because they were friends, they were emotionally open and loving..and a lot of men take this as romantic interest.

So, as one guy to another, I gotta say..your mindset might seem innocent but it genuinely seems like you're getting into friend groups in the hopes of romantic encounters developing, with people who aren't aware of this (but who might suspect it) and that isn't really fair to the people who just want their friends to be friends. Honesty goes a long way my dude.",">They enter into these friendships because they are hoping to pivot it to a romance.

I want to address this a bit. I don't really have an interest in going on random dates with people I don't know, what I prefer is to be friends first before I dedicate time into building a romantic relationship. The reason being is that the likelihood of a romantic relationship working with someone you already know you click with is far more likely (but obviously not impossible) than with a stranger you met or tinder.

So what tends to happen is that I look to friend groups for potential romantic partners. Now this doesn't mean I'm only friends with someone because I may potentially want to date them, I'm genuinely friends with people because at the time, that's all I was interested in. As the friendships build I may or may not want something more.","The issue is too many lads (am guy btw) enter into these relationships facetiously. They enter into these friendships because they are hoping to pivot it to a romance. It's SO horrible. I don't know a single woman who doesn't have an example of a guy who she thought was a friend trying to turn it into something else. Media has a big hand in this with all the romance bullshit and ""she'll love you eventually"" type shite (I'm gonna stop here coz I can rant on this subject for a while lol).

And yeah the adult way, people think it's the end of the world. Too many guys are putting too many eggs in their emotional baskets, and building these fantasies in their heads, only to be absolutely crushed about something that never was! And yeah there's issues about a lack of - emotional I forget the term, when men are lacking in it - but that's not on women either. Women shouldn't need to be on guard all the time worrying if a guy friend is gonna ""fall"" for them because they shown a bit of emotional affection.

Anecdotal as hell and I'm aware of it but I blame young kids not playing more with opposite genders. All lads I know with emotional maturity had girl friends growing up, and have women as actual friends in the friend group. 

(Also Jesus Christ live with women friends for a while. That'll shut that fantasy shit right down. You wanna get a sense of how normal people are live with em for a while lol)","I agree if she doesn’t want a relationship and you do and it’s clear that’s not going to happen best to just kill the relationship all together. Or at least put it on hold for a good long while.

I don’t understand why it’s that difficult to grasp.

 “Sorry, I can’t help but have feelings that move beyond platonic for you so I think it’s best we not pursue any relationship for the time being. Maybe in the future things will be different but for now this is best.

Weirdly he is an ex, but I think that is exactly why it works well - we mutually agreed that it wasnt working but that we genuinely cared about each other. Over 15yrs later and zero regrets... It's a bit tricky with relationships though. His wife is cool cos we all grew up together, but I dont think I've EVER had a partner that trusted the situation.... Because they all seem to think the only reason a man hangs around a women is to get their dick wet 🙄","I've started explaining to people who use this term that it really sucks to be ""girlfriend zoned"" or even ""fuck zoned""."
644,"You really clearly don't though - I'm saying that there's a small subset of makeup that is attached to ""partiarchal BS"" and there's other styles that absolutely go against it due to it being viewed as ""excessive"".

That's what I'm talking about - not makeup as a whole, but the styles that inherently clash with the patriarchal desires, workplace standards, and what is considered ""attractive"" by the general male population.

Also, on a note about Hijab - it's empowering in western nations where it would be easier for women to forsake wearing it because wearing it inherently brings judgement upon them from those that dislike muslims/Islam. It places their religion and culture unashamedly in the front of people's minds - it's about their choice and not conforming to what is considered the ""norm"" while embracing their religion.

Everything needs to be taken in context of the situation where the person is, their intentions, and what exactly the ""style"" of what they're doing is - nothing is in a bubble. Wearing makeup in a style that contrasts the ""accepted"" norm results in women being mocked and attempts to enforce them wearing the ""accepted"" styles, as does wearing hijab in areas where that's not considered the norm and there's potentially Islamophobia present.

Fuck judging people for femininity, and fuck judging people for not ""conforming"" to femininity. That's basically my feelings - I don't feel like anyone should be judged or criticised on either side because it just devolves into women tearing down other women because they're ""too feminine"" or ""not feminine enough"". The judgement goes in both ways, it's not just from feminity spaces.","I do understand you. Makeup can be a means for harmless fun or self expression. Its not inherently evil. Its just the patriarchal BS attached to it and enforcing it, mocking women who dont care for it. Online femininity spaces are full of this stuff. Even women treating you poorly just because you dont do performative femininity.","You're not understanding me - there's a range of makeup that is applied, and when you go too far with your use of it (i.e. full glam, alternative makeup, etc.) then it's no longer acceptable.

It's sure as shit a choice to wear alternative or full glam makeup, because you know that there will be plenty of people judging you (both men and women) because it's seen outside the societal norm.","Make up is like hijab, pretty much. It appears as a ""choice"" for some women, but how much of it is actually a choice if your natural face is seen as 'unprofessional', 'ugly' or 'too tired'. Or your workplace enforces it on you but not on men.","Technically if a woman was to show up in full glam makeup at certain workplaces, she may also be fired.

All of this shit depends on the workplace or the male observer - too much makeup is seen as bad, just as no makeup is seen as bad. They're both choices that women can use to express themselves, and aren't necessarily ""conforming"" to the patriarchy.","Then how is makeup feminist and empowering, if its just another tool to oppress women??  Women are treated as aesthetic objects, men are allowed to be themselves.",Employers can legally require women to wear makeup as part of an established dress code; they can impose such restrictions on female employees while not burdening male employees at a similar level.,"Ok?

She had pink everything, even facial tissue and bathroom tissue!","My grandma doesn't care about much makeup, but she keeps her bright red lipstick by the bed. She puts it on first thing, before she even leaves the bedroom.

I'm pretty sure she doesn't use a mirror because it's just a smear, no shaping or anything. She says she can't start her day without her war paint 😂","Same! I never loved having to wear makeup but once the pandemic forced us all to work from home and anytime I'd go out I had to wear a mask, I stopped putting it on and just never started back up again. Also shifted to more of an interest in skin care which has been great!

I grew up with a mother who wouldn't let me out of the house as a teenager if I wasn't wearing makeup. I had bad acne that I wanted to cover up and my mom grew up in the southern USA where being ""presentable"" was absolutely crucial to your social status. So I have always had a weird relationship with makeup. Even now in my late 20s, if I mention to my parents that I have an important zoom meeting or event they'll ask if I'm going to put makeup on for it. Like, no? This is my face, it doesn't matter how important the event is it's not going to change the face I present to people. 

It's been so freeing to reach this place with my self confidence!","For me, it was Covid. I have to wear a mask constantly at work (hospital) and have had to do so for the past 2.5 years, so wearing makeup didn't make any sense. It only ended  up on the inside of my mask, and it was too expensive for that. Eventually all my makeup expired and I found that I didn't really want to buy new. I am very interested in skincare, though, so my hobby just shifted a bit. 

Like you, I'm enjoying my newfound freedom of just walking out the door with a bare face if I feel like it.

Validating that it does suck when things are lined against you and encouraging her to find good mentors and outlets. And to keep trying no matter what others say.

652,"Uh, she's 2 1/2. 

 I'm more concerned with messages she's receiving about beauty standards, and about how beauty is still pretty central to the lives of young girls, and what society expects from girls. 

Obviously you are not the mother of daughters so you're comparing the kids you had in your class to mine, and I don't think it's really relevant right now.",I didn’t say that everything is solved. There’s a bigger picture I am looking at here. What are you going to communicate to your daughter about domestic labor (or communicate to young women in general)? That she should just accept it or that it’s worth pushing back on and not something she is required to do just because she’s a girl?,">more households where the woman is the breadwinner

But if covid showed up anything, it's that women are still doing the ""second shift"" when they get home, and still hitting the glass ceiling at work.

We'll agree to disagree here.","I think it does, because it means a lot more kids and young people are questioning the gender binary, which means they are open to questioning what it even means to be male or female which has largely been a social construct, which is kind of wonderful. I didn’t even know what gender non binary was until a friend (previously female identifying) came out as they/them to me a few years ago. I think it does help cis women, because it directly challenges what the patriarchy is holding up about gender norms, and basically is an f you to this system. It’s brave for people to come out as non binary, and it’s the first time gender as a social construct has entered the mainstream, and it does help us.

Yes, there is still sexism, but besides gender fluidity there are things that are changing. There’s more women who are college educated, more households where the woman is the breadwinner (https://www.americanprogress.org/article/breadwinning-mothers-critical-familys-economic-security/), more kids with openly gay parents which, more people coming out as trans and non binary (which you may or may not know about a kid for years), more people seeking treatment for their mental health, more women living their lives on their own and on their own terms. There are more movies and shows directed by women, and this has been awesome because we consume media. Yes, there are still bad things. My point, is it’s also good to acknowledge the positive changes, because the more we celebrate these changes the more positive impact we have on the world. If we only focus on what is worse, then what does this tell young women? It takes away their power in the world. It’s awful Roe was overturned, but there are still more of us that support roe it than not. If we want to push back and keep moving forward, we have to acknowledge the progress and continue to push progress. Otherwise, we are giving up, and yes, we could lose more rights. But, it’s not inevitable if we focus on how we want to shape the world and realize there are many like minded people, who are perhaps, the majority.","Okay, I'll give you that. But I don't really think that the fluidity of transgendered or binary youth really has much impact on cis-girls. Cis-girls and women don't suffer any less sexism than they did before. For them, things are very much the same, and sometimes, a bit worse.","I would say, for one thing, that are understanding of gender is changing, and this is the big, relevant change of what it even means to be a girl or boy in society. They/them is very common and accepted with young people and even kids, and kids are pretty willing to challenge gender norms in ways that didn’t exist before. There’s much more fluidity around gender than there used to be. 

I would also say there’s more acceptance and awareness of mental health and diverging from being neurotypical. So a lot of young people I have worked with are very good at talking about their struggles. This doesn’t mean they’d not have struggles, but it’s not stuffed down like it was a a generation or so ago. This has been my experience working with gen z. I also have a teenage stepson. The most popular kid in my stepson’s middle school was a girl that came out as gender non binary went by they/them and had cool style. It had nothing to do with looks. This is a big change, and would have been unheard of in the 90s or early 2000s. Gender non binary did not exist. 

I’m not saying it’s all better. We don’t live in a utopia or equal society. That being said, I am saying our understanding and attitudes towards gender are changing, especially among young people who, frankly, are leading the way on this, and that absolutely has an impact on how kids are expressing themselves. With parents who are supportive, usually, it’s good and positive.","How are things truly different for girls?

Sure, body and fat shaming is less prevalent, but it still happens. I wasn't pressured to send nude pictures to boys when I was growing up though, and I didn't have to contend with boys watching porn the way they do now in lieu of a sex education. Rampant sexism was going on when I was growing up, but music gave women a lot of power, and the freedom to be exactly what they wanted to be. Remember the Lilith Faire? There was a certain message about the 90's that I don't really see much today: *It's wonderful to be a woman. Celebrate your womanhood.*

I honestly can't really see how things are better today than they were then. I will say that teachers and parents are less tolerant of that shit than they were when I was growing up, but that's because it's *we* who have changed, not really kids.

I guess it all depends on what constitutes a good role model.....but I didn't say there weren't any, I just said there were few. And I really do believe that.","I don’t disagree there are problems for girls. I’m pointing out that there’s been changes, and things are different. That doesn’t negate any issues. I just think it’s worth considering what progress there has been, and that kids are a bit different than when we grew up (assuming you are a millennial). I definitely don’t think all issues have been solved for girls. That would be nuts.

I disagree there aren’t role models though."

I try not to make it worse but I’m living in hell with him just so I could be near him.

He makes sure we get to have our date nights, he’s more emotionally present and physically present when he isn’t working and home. He spends more time with me, he tries to meet my physical needs.

It’s just.. it’s bare minimum.. so I’m left feeling like the things I ask for more—aren’t being met.

659,Why do you assume I didn't?,Or maybe you could use google instead of demanding people re-expose themselves to news of child sexual assault just to do research for you?,"I'm not a Jackson fan.

660,I doubted myself for a bit too. I enjoyed the conversation too so not futile. Have a good'un.,"I’m really sorry! I watched this video previously, and despite going back and seeing this warning, I somehow completely missed it that it was YouTube’s doing. I thought that you were referring to trigger warnings that this creator uses, without actually understanding you. 

This argument has been futile and my fault! :(","I was reading it as the video had been slapped with these warnings by YouTube, who were basically saying that the content may be false and may mislead the viewer in some way that would have a negative impact on society.

It may be that these content warnings were in fact general trigger warnings that were added by the creator with positive intent.

If it is the latter I retract my previous criticisms, but looking at it again it does seem to be something YouTube has added to ward people away as if the video is going to e.g. incite hatred or violence.

You then get into the query of is this similar to censorship or is it more similar to a general age rating as you might see for all movies.","I think you’re wrong about content warning being about information, but I’m not 100% sure what it is. Here are two options:

1. Content warnings means that the medium features content that may be triggering, such as Abuse, Murder, Substance use. Trigger warning is about the discussion of such, without necessarily featuring content. For example, I could have triggered a classmate while talking about abortion, without actually featuring pictures, videos, recordings, written experience of abortion. I should put a trigger warning. If I do have any of these, i should’ve used a content warning for abortion. 

2. Content warning is about a medium featuring content that elicits strong negative emotions, such as abuse, murder, substance use. Trigger warning is about a medium featuring content that might elicit a traumatic response in someone. If my discussion includes depiction of excessively harsh criticism, and a classmate has traumatic responses from experiencing excessively harsh criticism, I should have a trigger warning, but not a content warning. I should have a content warning if I depict or mention something that will make most people very uncomfortable. Think Gordon Ramsey calling a cook stupid and him freezing/crying because of childhood trauma

So when a video contains hate-speech, a content warning would mean “this video will contain depiction of hatespeech and not just mention it” or “I think that most if not all of my audience find the hate speech that I will depict as disturbing, instead of eliciting a traumatic response in only a small part of the audience”","Yeh. So this video seemed to have one that basically said ""be careful with the information in this video, it may be false"". That is absolutely ridiculous for this specific video.

The ones that say ""this video touches on topics that may trigger xyz"" are a good thing.",Aah. I think I got you now,"Regarding content warnings: More or less I have no idea, but different ones. The ones calling out hatred (like this one) really shouldn't have content warnings, and there are far too many genuinely hateful ones that don't have warnings but should.

Trigger warnings are a different thing, and are absolutely fine and more videos should have them.",Are you saying “more videos should have tw” or not?

this image is both HILARIOUS and horrifying","Hahah, this is so insane! You're not wrong in that he's got the mindset of a teenager. The fact that he's insecure about the size of a toy designed for external stimulation is just so ridiculous to me. In what way would they compare, Adam?! Do you jiggly your dick on her clit violently in the same manner that a clit-stim toy does?  

OP, you have EVERY RIGHT to be mad and your response thus far is completely normal and justified. He's the one being a little bitch about everything. The fact that he views you as a living fleshlight during sex is so horrendously disrespectful.",I just bought the wand a couple of weeks ago and tried it on a couple of times when I was alone. I used it for the first time when the two of us were together a few days ago. I think he noticed that the wand is way bigger than his penis and so he got nervous.,">He then angrily asked me if my climaxing was just as important as his, and I replied by saying yes,

This question alone shows that he doesn't consider you sexual equals. He clearly doesn't consider you climaxing to be as important as him climaxing.

>He was initially fine with me using the bullet in bed earlier. A few days ago, I began using the wand and he just stopped and looked at me with a confused stare. I

Did something happen a few days ago or have you never used the wand in bed before? I don't understand why he would suddenly go from accepting your need to have clitoral stimulation to not accepting it."
662,What’s even weirder was I wasn’t calling anyone that.  I recommend something that had helped me a lot. It’s called “A N_rcissist’s Love” Letter by John Howell,That's so weird.  I thought word came up a lot on that sub.,Relationship advice,What?  Which sub?,"It’s narcissisti¢ triangulation.  They need the OP to be involved.

• Not sure what the rules are here, but I was banned from another sub for using the 2nd word, so I changed the spelling a bit.","Exactly.  

It's like getting under her skin is the only hobby they have together.  Once she pays them dust, they'll have to find something else to do.  I doubt it will work out well.","Exactly! The fact that they’re both so obsessed with OP, like dunking on her is the only thing their relationship is built on, is so pathetic. Just block them on everything and move on, living well is always the best revenge.","For real.  If they are so happy, why is OP still living in their heads rent free?  They both sound more obsessed with OP than each other."
663,"Damn, guess I need to follow some local food trucks. I need this in my life. Woefully out of the loop always.","Oh yes.  We have a Hawaiian shaved ice truck that we'd never be able to find if it wasn't for them sharing their location.  We've also found many local events because of them.  Like they'd post ""We'll be over at this event today"" and we're like, there's an event today?  Well let's check it out.","Also for all people like to bitch about social media in general, its fabulous for local businesses. I LOVE being gently reminded about my favorite local restaurants' weekly specials. Or sales, or street fairs or open studio days.","This is how I use Twitter, very curated.  Very narrowly focused on artists and cosplayers.","Honestly, I love TikTok. I keep it very curated and I get videos of people weaving interesting baskets, neat cooking tricks, this one woman who repairs loved stuffed animals, permaculture and botany stuff, an interesting guy who rants about pedestrian infrastructure failures, drag queen makeup videos. All of these sites can be horrible. Curate it for what you actually want and block what you don’t.","Eh, I'm 19 and most of my friends - even those older than me - love that app. I can't stand it...one video turns into ten then a hundred and soon enough, your whole day is gone to mindless short clips by people who don't know what they're talking about

Edit: word change","tbh I never understood the appeal of TikTok at all, but I'm probably just too old for it","I deleted Twitter and TikTok. They've been cesspools for ignorance, hate, and misinformation."
664,"That’s why twitter calls it “deactivation”, not “deletion”. Deactivating your account will not be subject to the 14 days GDPR law because it’s not technically “deleting” your account. 

In order for Twitter to actually remove all of your data from its databases you have to (a) be a citizen requesting from an EU country and (b) actually ask their customer support to delete everything. 

Source: I help manage global user data for a cloud company and have to do things differently for EU customers.","The law applies both internationally and to private companies. If twitter doesn't pledge to be deleting all user data when an account is requested to be deleted within I believe it's 14 days then it is not legal for them to operate in any EU territory and they can face a fine worth I think it's like 10% of their yearly earnings plus whatever other damages the EU court decides. 

Twitter can still be accessed from Europe so I'm fairly confident they are following this law.","not everyone, including Twitter itself, is in the EU. Also, now that it's a private company, they might just decide to keep all that data for themselves whether you delete it or not.",If you delete a tweet it's still backed up for 14 days so that changes nothing. Just deactivate the account. EU law mandates that all personal data is deleted within a certain amount of time after account deletion.,"This is not true. You have to delete all your tweets otherwise your data is still there. There are 3rd party bots that do it for you because the only way to delete tweets is individually.  Basically, you have to give the bot your login and password and it goes and runs the script. I learned this after I deleted my 15 year old account when Musk announced his intention to buy. Gotta nuke it completely otherwise he still gets your data whether you use the site or not.",Deactivating is deleting,"Hijacking top comment to ask: how do I delete my account? 

I never use Twitter but I made an account a long time ago and DEFINITELY want to delete it. Someone please give specific directions (for mobile users) because it’s NOT obvious how to do it. When I went to “help- account support” it gave me the run around. Eventually it mentioned “deactivating” the account, but I’m not sure if that’s the same as deleting it.","Nah I did this same thing a few days ago aswell. Had a friend make a tweet that literally just said ""pedophilia is bad"" and she got ratioed 5 times despite the original tweet having 100 likes from people trying to justify pedophilia. If musk doesn't actually do something that site is dead."
665,Neat. Other people said it but your comment is the one with 800 upvotes and awards. Your comment is the the main one OP or anyone will see.,That's why others pointed out to wait 🤷‍♀️,"Yes but you didn't say that. You said ""he'll never know it was you"", you don't know that.","She should wait couple weeks, as others have pointed out.",You don't know this and that's extremely irresponsible to say to OP.

667,Lmao nice,I'm the same. I had an IV removed and they had a cotton ball on and a bandaid over it. I walked out of the hospital and everyone was looking at me. I looked back and there was a trail of blood behind me.,Did they not put a cotton ball on it? Not that that can catch a whole load of blood most likely,"I'm a REALLY hard stick, and then I bleed everywhere when the needle comes out. When i had surgery recently and they removed my cannula in recovery, I looked down a few minutes later and the whole back of my hand was just red. 

I was still a bit out of it so I just stuck my hand in the air and called to the nurse 'sorry to bother you but is this supposed to happen?'",It means you're gonna be easy to put an IV in. There are few things (I think) a nurse hates more than having a super hard stick. I work as an aide with nurses and it's super frustrating when all the nurses on the floor has tried to put an IV into a patient and need to call house because nobody got one in.,"Date a nurse, they fucking love that shit. At least all the nurses I've met have. There's something about nurses and veins. (yes, the male nurses too)","I'm not a fan of my veins, makes me look sickly. But don't hate it to a point of doing surgery. This guy just made me feel worse about my insecurities.","Wtf… I love the look of my veins, they started being more prominent the more fit I got, so I view visible veins as a sign of strength. Be veiny and proud!!!!"
668,"Not heated at all, and the psychiatrist I gathered earlier.  Good luck and be well","i appreciate it as well! while self esteem *can* be indicative of how successful someone will be in life it's actually one of the more shaky ways to determine their success. personality theorists see incongruence between who one is and who one wants to be as a more solid indicator for distress and other similar issues in life. This is where i really think gender roles can hurt people, like you said with your point on nature vs nurture and how they could be passed down by parents. A child who's raised to be a girl that doesn't want to be a ""girl"" (in the context of feminine stereotypes) would probably show a greater incongruence between who she is/pressured by her family to be rather than who she wants to be and that's where you'd see more insecurities or, on the other side, more acting out. (Acting out is seen more with authoritarian or negligent parents) 

It's also definately frustrating to see it take it's toll on others you know.

Though self esteem can be built back up, you're right that it's incredibly difficult to climb out of those types of thinking. With therapy and psychiatry, many times it's not an option that many people can afford or just would be too embarrassed about attending due to how stigmatized it is. There's an incredibly large multitude of factors at play with situations like this and it really depends on the specific situations that lead to seeking out abusive partners, knowingly or otherwise. 

If any of this comes off as heated i assure you I don't mean for it to, i just got out of classes so I'm a little fried, also if you want me to clarify anything please ask, I'm studying to be a psychiatrist and love talking about personality theory and child development/psychology","“Loser magnets” are the ladies who say “why do I always go out with losers” as you saw it wasn’t an insult. I also agree that a woman who’s never been in that type of relationship ends up with that personality trait. It’s either a family member talking down to (or at) her or radiating off a parent who’s witnessed it in their parent, I don’t know exactly. I will say it’s way to common and until there’s some way to teach self-esteem it won’t get better, unfortunately. But how, I think that comes from your own successes, win at sports get more confidence playing, same with exams at school, but I hated to see it in some of my daughters friends. I appreciate the dialogue","I'd say you're right that self esteem plays into it, i see it as the result of a self fulfilling prophecy wherein the women who you so hilariously put as 'loser magnets' are that way because they believe they can't do any better. what interests me is what causes women who're neurotypical and haven't gone through trauma/psychological programming by an abuser, to develop that sense of themselves and when it takes form. Gender norms seem very pervasive with younger girls, which reminds me of this really great video essay I watched about the book titled 'the care and keeping of you' and how that book used to perpetuate ideas about dressing modestly and that it's not okay to discuss puberty and going through it (for girls of course.) 

All this to say that i think you hit the nail on the head and that I believe part of that insecurity for women who hadn't already had it programmed into them is caused by how heavily parents or caregivers adhere to gender roles.

 I think the idea of the ought self and the actual self also definately go hand in hand with this but i digress- I'd be happy to try (to the best of my half completed psych degree) to explain those a little more, it's really interesting stuff!","Thank you, your thoughts if you don't mind.","This is an interesting comment, I'm just commenting as a bookmark to see how the discussion goes when more people reply!","Interesting you say that and here’s a theory of mine.  I’ve always said the most attractive trait any woman can have is self-esteem or self-confidence. Most real men are not afraid of a successful, intelligent woman but they are attracted to them where insecure “men” or I’ll say abusive guys avoid them. A woman with little to no self-esteem in fact are loser magnets (is that too harsh?). In that situation the guy sees a woman who won’t question him, when asked “where do you want to go eat?” will say wherever you want is fine, what movie “whatever you want to see” etc. which for that guy is great until it’s not. At some point that does get old and that’s when he changes and isn’t nice any longer, now it’s “can’t you make a choice?” “Why am I always deciding, can’t you make an F’in decision?” etc. and it gets worse from there, I believe that’s why so often it’s “he was so nice when we started dating then he changed….”.  So a confident woman attract confident men.  Any replies either agree or disagree?",It really is. What you’ll find though is men do exist who value strong women. And the reality is those guys still were formed within and live in a culture that is misogynistic AF so they won’t always get it right - but when you call them on their shit they’ll listen and learn.

PS: Friday he said he campaigned for Obamacare in ALL 54 states.  True","I STRONGLY disagree with the concept that ""both sides"" are equally bad in these regards. One political party generally tries to promote the protection of marginalized people, one does not. One is significantly better about not spreading misinformation. Fox news isn't the republican party, but continues to host Tucker Carlson, who's rhetoric is alarmist and damaging to public trust, not to mention racist and misogynistic. Republican candidates continue to spread rumors about voter fraud in attempts to delegitamize any candidates they don't agree with, while conservative state legislatures try to make voting more difficult. But this is just finger pointing, right? So look at the legislation, look at what politicians from both sides propose and what they vote for. Let the actual policies speak for themselves.

I *hateeee* whataboutism, believe me, but I truly think if you were presenting as a woman, this wouldn’t have happened to you at this level.

674,">So no, it’s not whataboutism by any definition to talk about violence against women and girls (which btw is not the same thing as violence against AFAB people - violence against AFAB people includes trans men, and VAWG includes trans women, which you seem to be conveniently forgetting in your haste to turn this into two groups competing with each other…). 

You were specifically talking about violence against **AFAB** people

>to women (and enbies) who are **AFAB**

I said that it isn't because someone is AFAB vs AMAB

>I think it's less of an AMAB vs AFAB thing
 
You were the one pitting AFAB vs AMAB (a line of distinction that I, as a non-binary person myself, hate). You were the one who in response to a trans* person turned around and said that AFAB people have it worse. It's no different than those men who turn around and bring up how bad male suicide statistics are, but only in response to people commiserating about misogyny. Which is especially egregious when statistics show that ""women who are AFAB"" don't actually experience violence ""more so"" than trans people (once again, including non-binary people such as OP) of **either** AGAB.

Look, I'm going to stop replying here. All you're doing is flipping an uno reverse card and going ""no u"" on the bits that I'm calling out.

EDIT: and I've been blocked","um, the post also says that OP *now understands what women experience* in terms of harassment and violence. So no, it’s not whataboutism by any definition to talk about violence against women and girls (which btw is not the same thing as violence against AFAB people - violence against AFAB people includes trans men, and VAWG includes trans women, which you seem to be *conveniently* forgetting in your haste to turn this into two groups competing with each other…). 

This is a lot more complicated than you think it is, and actually unpicking the nuances and challenging some of the assumptions here is a necessary and important thing to do. Shutting down discussion and trying to make people compete with each other in the way you are attempting to push for is incredibly unhealthy. Literally nothing in my comments is anything but supportive of the OP, and it’s possible to be supportive *alongside* engaging in a wider discourse. You do not have an absolute right to set the terms of discussion here.

eta: tbh if anyone is dismissive, it’s you.","Both things are bad, **but** you were the one who said that people are more aggressive to AFAB people on a post about a non-binary person who was AMAB, in a reply to a comment talking about how people are particularly awful to AMAB people who don't conform to such an assumption.

Further you posted a link talking about violence against women, and yes, compared to men women are much more likely to be a victim of violence. However, OP is not a man, nor were the groups addressed in the comment you replied to (with the exception of femboys, but them being men is secondary to the point being made). I brought up statistics of violence against trans people because non-binary people are definitionally also transgender (with some very rare exceptions where a person may be intersex **and** also raised as such).

Honestly your comments come off as a whataboutism and utterly dismissive to the harrassment trans and non-binary people face.","Why are you trying to create a comparison between trans people as a group and women as a group? It’s not a competition. Trans people do face utterly undeserved violence and harassment, that’s true. But my comments are specifically about the pandemic of violence against women and girls:

I don’t see any need for invidious comparison. **Both things are bad.**","Honestly, I think it's less of an AMAB vs AFAB thing and more of a being a visible minority thing.

[In general, transgender people are 4 times as likely to be victimised than their cisgender peers. However the rate of victimisation is approximately equal between trans men and women.](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/ncvs-trans-press-release/)

This is corroborated from what I have anecdotally heard from people in both my local and online trans communities; that while it doesn't full go away, the amount that they are sexually harassed actually decreases was they pass better.",People are often just as aggressive as this - or more so - to women (and enbies) who are AFAB. This is…super misleading.,"Totally this. He used the excuse of OP ""not really being a woman"" to extra harass them. He likely wouldn't have been quite so aggressive if OP was AFAB (you know, depending on his level of assholery and drunkenness, there's always those special snowflakes...) 

Regardless, it is a sad woman/femme real-life experience. Get this sub started on things like having crotches grabbed in crowded clubs and the comments could go on forever...

675,"I'm not saying that it's the individual's responsibility to change. I'm well aware of late stage capitalism and the hellscape that it creates. What I'm saying is that it's unfair to expect women to bring home half of the income *and* do the vast majority of the emotional and domestic labor. Which is exactly what I said.

Yes, I do think if men did the majority of the domestic and emotional labor, then it would very much be viewed differently. What a silly question. Of course it would. Everything that gets pushed off on women is devalued and given less importance in the heterosexual relationship ""exchange.""","If I'm understanding correctly, in your opinion it's essentially less about the degree or salary itself and more about the assumed contributions to the relationship based on past experience and statistical averages? So if for example a potential partner made less money than you but did the majority of the household work and wasn't an emotional burden, that would be a ""fair trade"" (assuming of course that less income = less hours at work, which isn't a guarantee in the current economy)?

>also expected to have a full-time job and provide half the income

This is probably the only thing you listed that isn't directly the responsibility of individuals to change. Time was, a single minimum wage job could support two adults and multiple children. Thanks late-stage capitalism and wage stagnation!","Because women already do vastly disproportionally more of the emotional and domestic labor in heterosexual relationships and then, on top of that, are also expected to have a full-time job and provide half the income. So, coupling down can be seen as really doing a great disservice to a woman's worth. Why even bother saddling yourself with the burden of a ""partner"" when you're the one bringing literally everything to the table?","You're right, college graduates in the US are 60/40 female/male, with the ratio trending female more and more every year. The gender divide has gotten bad enough that some colleges are looking into affirmative action plans that can be taken to increase male attendance/graduation rates.

>women have the choice of dating someone ""lesser""

I asked the person you replied to this, but I'll ask you as well: why is ""dating down"" seen as a bad thing for women?","> Women often feel the need to date someone less successful than them or get lost in the dating pool.

That's just a statistics though.

If we limit to something easily measurable like educational achievement then women are the majority of students in tertiary education in (I'm fairly certain) practically every western country.   
In my country the disparity is 2 to 1, in the US it's what, 3 to 2? Something like that.

Assuming the minority sexualities is somewhat evenly spread the women have the choice of dating someone ""lesser"", sharing a man, or being single.","This is totally valid and something I experience in my 30s as well. Unfortunately in my opinion, there are not enough Black (and potentially Latino) men who can keep up to the success of Black/Latina women. Women often feel the need to date someone less successful than them or get lost in the dating pool.","Except when it doesn’t. I have many Black and Latina friends who are talented, educated, and attractive who are in their 40s and early 50s who still have this issue.","You are not alone! Once you get to a better city, establish a professional life, it will get better. I’ve honestly had so much better luck dating European guys but that’s another convo."

678,Lol. Yup! The pool wasn't especially huge where I live.,"If you swiped yes on pretty much everyone, were you actually attracted/interested to pretty much everyone?",I did hear that Tinder tends to suppress people who swipe yes on every match so that others don't see them crop up.  Which possibly screwed me over a little when I tried using Tinder since the women on there mostly all seemed pretty great and it was rare for there to be any overt red flags like open racism in their bio.,"Back in the day, when I was used OKC the website, you'd be able to see when the user was last active. For the swiping era of online dating, I don't know what they do if you delete the app without deleting your profile - if you even can delete your profile. I know on at least one app I had to make a new profile after deleting the app and later reinstalling it. I also know that on the apps where they don't limit how many folks you can ""like"" per day, there are people who like absoutely everyone without exception, just in case. I'm sure many of my matches fall into that category. I don't know about needing to be a member to message on the mainstream/popular apps but they are always hawking the paid version. The point is, (it feels like) plenty of peope have success despite all these things so it gets really depressing.","This is very much the case. They need to appear to be active and have lots of people who are in the action. So they use tons of bots and fake profiles.

And always push for that golden subscription.","I am not sure the current situation in dating apps so maybe this has changed. But 10 years ago when I was doing this as a male on the big dating site of the time it turned out that a lot of women on the site were not members and thus could not respond. Then when I quit the service myself, they kept my profile up even though I cancelled. The only thing I was able to do to keep them from putting my profile up when I was not part of the service was to physically delete the pictures, text etc. Why did they do this? Well I would get e mails from them saying someone replied to my profile. I could look at the response and profile but if I wished to respond I had to become a paying member. But back then, I know from my personal profile, they are putting profiles up that are NOT part of the service. They did it repeatedly with mine.

Sooo it would not surprise me if some of the profiles people are looking at, responding to may not be real, or be able to respond (as I said, haven't done online dating lately maybe it has changed). So I was sending out all these e mails getting no responses back, taking a hit to the ego in the process. Yet I have no idea how many of those folks were actually still on the service and could have replied if they wanted. But the ego took a hit none the less. Something to consider if getting no response if they still play these games.","Thank you for this. I feel so seen because emphatic disinterest is the most apt description of online dating I've ever heard.  For context, I am a woman and I live in a medium-big city, on the East Coast.

I get matches on any app/site I use, but I get very few messages and no one ever responds if I intiate. I have friends who will only use Bumble, the App where only women can initiate,  due to perceptions of safety, but I've never ever had someone I reached out to on Bumble respond so I deleted it.

It doesn't matter if I say something low effort like ""Hey, how are you?"" or actually put in effort to say something witty/interesting/flirty.  People don't respond me. That's not to say that I've never had a reply when I initiated but of all the dates/relationships I've had from dating sites, it's probably 90 percent they reached out and 10 percent I reached out. And people don't initiate very often either. I don't know why there is so little interest in me but it definitely is depressing. Sorry, this is not directly related to OP but your wording rang so true to me.","I can sort of relate? I'm a guy so the dynamics at play are quite different. But when you do the online dating thing and get met with emphatic disinterest in you, its hard not to internalize that sometimes and make you feel like there's something wrong with you. People sometimes try and give you advice and tell you to revise that profile or that your picture sucks (which can hit hard when its a normal every day picture of you that is really an honest representation of what you look like) ,  but after putting all that effort in and still zero interest it can hit you even worse.  


Then sometimes someone will hit you back and normally you would realize this person is absolutely not for you and are actually kind of awful. But then you put up with them making some pretty insulting jokes at your expense and you find yourself trying not to confront them about things they say that you object to because they were willing to at least give you some attention and you don't want to rock the boat."
679,"I am a black woman. Why would I lie about being a black woman?  I think you’re a troll, why else respond the way you did?  Not sure what exactly I said that offended you. 

I’m honestly having a very hard time dating. I’ve seen white man after white man pick white women at church to date and marry. They’ve never picked me. After 5 years I finally figured out that they don’t want black women. I got all my dates from online dating 5 years ago and even that was hard because I was still being filtered out. Something changed during Covid 19 because I haven’t gotten a date in 2 years. Dating in the Midwest is extremely hard for black women.

It is what it is, but the problem isn't black men don't want to date black women. No man wants to date us period. And what makes you think we just long be in such homogeneous relationships?

The main problem is most black men don’t want to date black women. They want to date white women. If all white women stopped dating black men then black men would be forced to change. 70% of black women never get married, that’s a big problem.

Black men are fetishizing white women. Why would white women choose to play into that?

You don’t sound like an ally to black women. How can women stick together when we refuse to support each other?","""You are taking black men away from us""

Wtf am I reading?","Knowing most black men date white women then dating black men. Yes, you are playing into it. You are taking black men away from us. If all white women stood up for black women then this wouldn’t be a problem. Black men will never learn if white women keep dating them.","If a guy said to me ""I don't date Black women because they are Black women"", I wouldn't date him. But if he never brings it up, and otherwise acts normal, and never makes any racist comments, how am I supposed to know? That doesn't mean I'm ""playing into it"".","I agree. I’m black, through research I’ve discovered only 30% of black women get married. It’s because of the racism. Most black men don’t want black women, they want white or anyone besides black women. White men only want white or any other race than black women. All other races go for the same. The Midwest sucks for dating. I’m filtered out of dating apps because the men only want white women. White women play into it because they date these racist men. 

Religion is also a problem. Racism is a lot higher amongst white Christians than the non religious.

Finally, Confucianism being based on Confucius as a religion is true. But Confucius himself was raised in a patriarchal society.

They didn't completely ""throw it away"". You can't just erase thousands of years of cultural conditioning overnight, no matter how much the CCP tries.

Non-patriarchal religions like Wicca were never in power in most places (especially so post-colonialism, when patriarchal societies steamrolled everyone globally) so they're irrelevant for this argument","And yet they threw it away and maintain patriarchal positions. The point again being that religion is not needed to enforce the patriarchy.

There are plenty of non-patriarchal religions too, like Wicca.",">  Nobody would put China ahead of the UK for being less patriarchal, would they?

China also has thousands of years of Confucianism (and it's included misogyny) influencing their culture, and cultures across East Asia. Confucianism was a state religion for thousands of years, and just because it's no longer an official religion doesn't mean there isn't that patriarchal baggage left over.

Point is the vast majority of the time if there is a patriarchy, you can usually identify religion as a root cause enforcing it.","That doesn't really bear out in reality.

683,You're welcome--hugs and best of luck to you.❤️,"Oh thank you. It's not anywhere near what my grandmother went through. It's not physical or constant.

I wish every day that my young mind was capable of hearing her back then. I was so naive.,"A thousand amens to all of this.   


What your grandmother told you reminds me of something my sister brought up--she works for the state health department and during the COVID vaccine rollout she was helping with the seniors and high-risk groups getting vaxed. She was taking temps at the door. She'd show the thermometer, say ""Will you let me take your temperature?"", and telegraph her movements (and she's not a big or physically intimidating person at all), and still there were so. many. elderly women who flinched every time she brought her arm up. One of them closed her eyes and shook. There's just so much silent pain in the older generations and so little that's changed.","I actually am totally wondering if this is a script! If anyone else knows about it, please tell me. It was so weird. There are subs where people will happily degrade you on Reddit consensually.... I feel like that's what he wanted maybe???.....go to the degradation kink subs and not to this 38 year old woman who is completely fed up. 

But being in my 30s has totally changed my mind about men. I've changed so much. Tried to better myself. I journal and meditate and attend therapy and read books about the issues with which I suffer and attend group therapy, and I see my doctor regularly and take my prescriptions, and make a point of learning how to apologize when I have fucked up and make sure it's genuine because I can still love myself even when I fuck up so I no longer need to be defensive when apologizing to boost my ego.... this has been a 20 year effort. Men....do they do anything like this??? 

I want to be treated like a human being. Not a.... trauma dump. We have our own feelings and needs and most every woman I know is putting in massive effort. 

I have said before that my grandmother told me when I was a young teenager that women like her, married in the 50s, stay at home moms of veterans, several children, left completely alone to manage children, the household, and war veterans with PTSD and alcoholism, were miserable. She told me to never be that for a man... that she had dreams and wanted a job and she never had that opportunity. She told me that they took a lot of dangerous barbiturates and amphetamines (!!!!!!!) just to get through shit back in the day. These women were miserable living that life. They told us first hand. Why in the fuck would I ever want to go back to hand holding grown men while they deplete my life force entirely for NO RECIPROCAL BENEFITS. Often times it's just abuse and soulless emptiness and massive loneliness and hopelessness. That's what happens to women when you make us focus entirely on taking care of everyone except ourselves. We managed to scrape together improvements and happiness from the bleakness. 

Don't tell me men can't do the same right now for themselves. 

Also, a side note...on Facebook you can't say anything remotely negative about men without coding the word or using emojis or you risk a temporary ban. I got one for implying that I myself was a lowly idiot to make a point and I got Facebook jail...for implying that I was a fucking idiot.

I had a man message me and ask if I could look at a picture and honestly judge if his man titties were too big. He threw in a whole back story about a girl laughing at him.

This isn't a safe scale for you. Violence always escalates.

 Please keep posting so you can see your thoughts and talk with others while you explore resources as you are able. If you could set an internal timeline to exit the relationship, that may help you.

Use a browser for this work that erases your browsing history, so all that's on your computer is your generic shopping and news history.","Oh thank you. It's not anywhere near what my grandmother went through. It's not physical or constant. I do see the best in people. 🙂 it's just hard sometimes. I wish I would have really heard what she was trying to say about men. She was trying to tell me they were very much not all safe. I get it now. I don't think I will ever be with a man in a long term relationship again.

And please don't blame yourself--you have nothing to feel ashamed of for trying to believe the best of someone who didn't deserve it.",That breaks my heart. My grandmother watched her alcoholic husband beat her sons and felt she could do nothing because the beating would get worse fo for her and what if she could not take care of them after? What if he got mad and left and she's never had a job before? The pain they carry is immense. Lost dreams and guilt and trauma. I am in an abusive marriage anyway though. I wish every day that my young mind was capable of hearing her back then. I was so naive.,"A thousand amens to all of this.   


What your grandmother told you reminds me of something my sister brought up--she works for the state health department and during the COVID vaccine rollout she was helping with the seniors and high-risk groups getting vaxed. She was taking temps at the door. She'd show the thermometer, say ""Will you let me take your temperature?"", and telegraph her movements (and she's not a big or physically intimidating person at all), and still there were so. many. elderly women who flinched every time she brought her arm up. One of them closed her eyes and shook. There's just so much silent pain in the older generations and so little that's changed.","I actually am totally wondering if this is a script!

I feel like that's what he wanted maybe???.....go to the degradation kink subs and not to this 38 year old woman who is completely fed up. 

But being in my 30s has totally changed my mind about men. I've changed so much. Tried to better myself. I journal and meditate and attend therapy and read books about the issues with which I suffer and attend group therapy, and I see my doctor regularly and take my prescriptions, and make a point of learning how to apologize when I have fucked up and make sure it's genuine because I can still love myself even when I fuck up so I no longer need to be defensive when apologizing to boost my ego.... this has been a 20 year effort. Men....do they do anything like this??? 

I want to be treated like a human being. Not a.... trauma dump. We have our own feelings and needs and most every woman I know is putting in massive effort. 

I have said before that my grandmother told me when I was a young teenager that women like her, married in the 50s, stay at home moms of veterans, several children, left completely alone to manage children, the household, and war veterans with PTSD and alcoholism, were miserable. She told me to never be that for a man... that she had dreams and wanted a job and she never had that opportunity. She told me that they took a lot of dangerous barbiturates and amphetamines (!!!!!!!) just to get through shit back in the day. These women were miserable living that life. They told us first hand. Why in the fuck would I ever want to go back to hand holding grown men while they deplete my life force entirely for NO RECIPROCAL BENEFITS. Often times it's just abuse and soulless emptiness and massive loneliness and hopelessness. That's what happens to women when you make us focus entirely on taking care of everyone except ourselves. We managed to scrape together improvements and happiness from the bleakness. 

Don't tell me men can't do the same right now for themselves. 

Also, a side note...on Facebook you can't say anything remotely negative about men without coding the word or using emojis or you risk a temporary ban. I got one for implying that I myself was a lowly idiot to make a point and I got Facebook jail...for implying that I was a fucking idiot.

686,"yes, and what do you think is going to happen in therapy besides “men, just stop?” i’ve already offered other solutions and i can give you many more besides what you’re saying which is, “men, just go to therapy”","Therapy is not a cure all for anything.

Its not a cure all for drug addiction. Its not a cure all for mental health. Its not going to be a cure all for men that hate women for whatever motive they may have. 

But it is the best we've got. Therapy is also for a lot more than literal mental illness. ""Men, Just stop"" is never going to work. We have to make them.","it’s coddling that we suggest them going to therapy is all they need when people have no idea the slightest amount of what actually happens in therapy. if you go in and say “i’m lonely,” well the therapist is going to just suggest you meetups and activities to go to, where the man can then harass women there with professional approval. the therapist will not figure this out until a couple years into it, because it takes time to dig through the surface at the inner issues. we could have been raising men differently this entire time instead of wasting time and resources on people who have no intent on becoming better and hardly see women as people. 

for example, mass murders are an incel related problem. this is not cured by therapy. it’s also multi faceted. men who feel entitled to womens bodies do not have a mental illness or any kind of emotional distress. they are simply frustrated that they can’t demand sex and have women fall at their feet.

suggesting therapy is also problematic because it suggests these men have a mental health issue. this is far from it. they are usually very privileged and live comfortable lives. they are fully capable of changing their mindset on their own, to stop watching misogynistic men on youtube, to stop laughing at rape jokes, to stop blaming women for all of their problems. they choose not to.

inb4 “therapy is for everyone”, no it’s really not. if you go in there with no actual pressing issues, you will just stare at each other for 45 minutes. learned this the hard way.","Not trying to makes leaps, I just really don't understand what you want. I don't think you actually want less men in therapy, that's just what it sounds like. ""Men need to fix it"" is not an actionable solution so I can only base what I think you think the solution is on the fact you are claiming therapy to be a solution by women and therefore a bad option.

Destigmatizing therapy IS the societal solution.

Therapy is not coddling, as you mention it is hard work and requires active effort to change yourself.","you’re making a lot of leaps about what i’m saying. individual people going to therapy is great. but suggesting every man in current society enrolling in therapy will fix the problem is insane. it’s clearly not a personal issue. and when you treat a societal issue like that, you make the societal solution women, again, in a different setting. i’ve been going to therapy for years. i know the kind of work they do. if you do not actually want to change, you won’t change. it’s hard work. its exhausting. i highly doubt these types of people are willing to put in the effort. stop coddling them.","So, your argument is therapy wont work?

Therapy actually is ""them working it out themselves"". People go to therapy to work on themselves. Going to a therapist isnt nonconsensual, male or female they can turn down any patient they want. 

Youre also making it out like these are convicted felons. These are guys who think they are lonely and want to figure out why. The therapist will tell them their want for a partner is a deflection from why they are actually unhappy. Therapy ensues.","not what i was saying at all. but putting dangerous men in a close setting with women is a bad idea, and also just reinforces their belief that women are there as tools for them to use to feel better. the long term solution is that men stop feeling so goddamn entitled to womens bodies and time. they need to get used to it. this stuff is not only caused by porn, the media, their fathers, but also encouraged and shared by men among each other. nothing women say will change their perception of women. they need to work it out themselves.","Thats the short term solution but doesnt tackle the cause. We also need long term solutions.

Your solution is like having soup kitchens but no effort to create affordable housing. Sure, you're saving lives now, but youre really just surviving while maintaining the status quo. 

And in no instance does anyone that knows anything about mental healthcare think the actions of a patient are the fault of the therapist."

692,"The early Romans believed that a good woman was a woman who did nothing noteworthy, except to honor her male relatives and her family’s lineage.

Lucretia is held up as an example of a virtuous woman because she “allowed” a man to rape her when he said he was going to kill her and a male slave in he bed as if he caught her in the act of adultery. She would rather be raped than shame her husband by being accused of being adulterous. After the rape, she called her husband and father to her, “confessed” to being raped (it was seen as the woman’s fault, no matter what) and then killed herself to preserve her family’s lineage and honor.

Roman women didn’t even have real names. Each daughter was given the feminized version of her father’s name. If there were more than one daughter, they would be named Julia Major (older daughter of Julius) and Julia Minor (younger daughter of Julia).",Thanks for the rec!

Women just can’t win. Have no children? You’re damaged. Have one child? You’re damaging your kid (I got that one a lot). Have more than one kid? Geez, haven’t you heard of birth control?","I'm one of those women that've never ever wanted children. I literally used to beg my parents not to have anymore kids after me (I'm the youngest of my siblings). It's disgustingly common for those of us who don't want kids to be told we'll change our minds, all women want children, no - you can't get sterilised because what if you meet the right person. 

Why is it that if a 16 year old girl accidentally gets knocked up and goes through with the pregnancy, no one bats an eye but a woman in her early 30s whose never wanted kids ""might change her mind""?

People outside of /r/childfree tend to think it's a toxic sub because sure, some people don't like kids but honestly there's a lot of support and we can all commiserate with each other about our frustrations of what it's like to be a person who genuinely does not want children.

Agree to disagree for sure","You can set your own standards, that's fine. But in my experience, setting higher standards gets you a better, more considerate partner. So I will always advise women to leave if they aren't being considered. Feel free to not follow that advice.","If I was in a relationship and someone got me a Christmas present I didn’t ask for or even allude to wanting and I showed appreciation, but didn’t get them anything and then got broken up with immediately without discussion, I’d think that person was nuts.

I’d never do this, but if I *said* I’d get something for them and then didn’t, I’d be more understanding if they wanted to end things immediately, but I’d still think an immediate break up without discussion would be a drastic move.

There are plenty of fish in the sea, and women have historically been taken for granted when it comes to hetero relationships, but what I see now is a lot of people over-correcting and just sifting through men until they find the perfect man that does the perfect things.. and I just think that’s so silly because no one is perfect and if you expect your man to know all the “rules” of common courtesy and won’t sacrifice a second of your time to discuss your expectations, you better be fucking perfect, too",No. I don't think you should ever have to ask for common courtesy. I refuse to ask people for basic consideration. There are better fish in the sea.,"Yes, but there was a key thing you said there: “keep asking for common courtesy”.. I personally am just waiting for OP to say explicitly that she has had a conversation with her SO.

She says this has been happening for two years and she said he said he doesn’t celebrate Valentine’s Day (but I wasn’t under the impression that the topic of the gift giving empty promises is what led to him saying that.. I took it as them speaking generally about that particular holiday.. I could be wrong though of course) and then she said she’s just not going to get him a gift anymore..

She never said she that in two years she’s ever actually had a conversation with him about this thing that clearly bothers her.. maybe she did, but I don’t like filling in contextual details in order to form an opinion.. I’m very curious to know what he’s said when she really brings it up.. if she has..

People are going to walk all over you if you let them.. and if it turns out that OP just kept expecting her SO to spontaneously change without having a real conversation, I have no issue putting some of the blame on her for not standing up for herself.. hints and passive aggressive huffs and puffs doesn’t translate (which I know is a huge assumption there - I’m just giving a generally example).. but yeah, if you’re in a relationship for two years and don’t feel comfortable being straight up and having a conversation or just otherwise letting something like this go on for two years without explicitly discussing what your expectations are, that’s not completely on the SO..

All that said, IF it turns out OP has in fact been continuously “asking for common courtesy”, I’m 100% with you and the majority of the people in these comments..

And actually, I’m not even an advocate for second chances honestly.. setting a boundary one time should be enough.. if they care, they only need to hear it once and there are plenty of potential partners out there who “only need to hear it once”.. I feel like a lot of people are taking what I say as “be patient and lenient on men because they don’t know better” which is not my sentiment at all, but people are responding to me like that’s what I’m saying.. I am literally just saying: “step 1. say something”

Am I assuming she hasn’t said anything yet? More like, she didn’t say she said anything so I am taking that as she didn’t say anything.","I think the opposite - people take yellow flags and don't have the proper caution, and that's how they end up in relationships like the one OP describes, where their partner fails to show up time and time again. I've dated too many people like that to even give them a chance - and then I ended up with a great guy who *doesn't* drop the ball. It's better to be selective than having to keep asking for common courtesy, imo.","I mean, I guess we’re all just different, but if I were in this situation, it would clearly be an issue (if he wasn’t giving presents, but I was), but it’s no where near deal breaker territory for me.. especially if I haven’t even had a conversation about it first.

I posted another long winded reply elsewhere, but I just think the yellow flags in a relationship are worth a conversation before jumping ship, because people just think differently and prioritize differently.. my sister once blew up at me for something I didn’t see coming one bit.. it was just a blind spot for me.. off the record: I still don’t quite understand why it was a big deal or how she even cared to put so much energy into being bothered about it, but guess what? I didn’t say any of that stuff to her, because whatever her reasons, it clearly bothered her and I care about her and that was enough for me to care about this thing that bothered her and be more attentive to it.. I think the “you can’t change people” is taken too literally and rigidly..

Additionally.. the other side to this is determining.. hey, is this a yellow flag? or is it an incompatibility? If it were me, I’d be on the other side of this.. I *hate* giving/receiving gifts.. the only difference between me and this guy is that I would never say I’m gonna give someone a gift in the first place.. if he got me a gift, I’d say “ohh you didn’t have to do that! Aw, thank you! I feel terrible I didn’t get you anything” and that’d be the end of it.. if that happened several more times, honestly, I’d be as uncomfortable as he felt slighted, like.. he’d think “why isn’t she getting the hint that she should be getting me gifts” and I’d think “why isn’t he getting the hint that I don’t do gifts”.. that’d be an indication of incompatibility.. then if we have to have a conversation, depending on how compatible we are in the other areas, if he really expressed that he’d appreciate more gifts, I’d absolutely give in without question.. but if he says “oh, I was just doing it because I thought you were supposed to but if you really don’t care about gifts, giving or receiving, then we don’t have to do that”, that’d be even better

Honestly, I only like giving gifts if I know the person is going to like it.. like if there is something I know he’s been eyeing for a while and a special occasion is coming up, I’d definitely get it.. if a special occasion wasn’t coming up, I’d just get it as soon as I could if it was something I could afford readily.. gifts for the sake of gifts straight up makes me nauseous and gives me anxiety, giving and receiving.. to have it deemed as “who would want to be with a person who doesn’t give gifts on special occasions” - I take that personally.. and I just really don’t think that’s a hard rule the way a lot of people here are making it out to be","Does she really want to date someone who doesn't take the time to think ""hey maybe I should find my gf a gift like I told her I would for this major holiday that many many people give gifts for and my gf gave me one two years in a row"". Even if he's not malicious, he's dense and the opposite of thoughtful - how far does this extend into their relationship? Deal breaker."

Apple can give the FBI the encrypted file but neither party can access the contents. 

Any data that you could access through a web browser on [iCloud.com](https://iCloud.com) can't be encrypted in order to allow you to access it, since Apple's server needs to serve the data to you, so they have to be able to read it. That's the stuff being subpoenaed - photos mainly. 

Nothing in the health app is accessible through iCloud, even though it's in the encrypted backup.","Umm, by definition it is. It's ""iCloud content"".

Asked her later "" How many go back? "" Seemed surreal to me, he didn't have his claws into me that deep yet and I had a baby to protect. She looked around, made this almost hopeless gesture said "" All of them "". I said "" I won't "". That doesn't make me special, like I said he didn't have his psycho claws deep enough into me yet .

Please do report, every time. Might be someone not too far into a psycho's power to break free. Have always worried about those other women. And their kids- there were other kids in there too. Also wish that woman could know I didn't go back . The baby that was saved is now a doc. She knows about her father, goes to therapy and by a wonderful stroke of fortune he's dead.

I had to call the cops on the people in the apartment right by mine as after a week of partying noises and frustration it suddenly got way worse, shit flying off balcony, sounded like a proper beatdown going on.

Pregnant girlfriend and his family stay there (despite accusations he beats her).

I heard what sounded like her saying ""I can't breathe, stop"" so I called the cops and went to knock on the door at the same time to try to stop him doing anything worse before cops got there.

She eventually left and I walked with her to her car, she was thankful but also made excuses for him, didn't stay to talk to cops (though they talked to her later).

711,More often perps have family and friends charmed. They're so convincing. And then we wear family and friends down because it just never stops.,">Also had amazing, very strong family support.

This is so important for an abuse victim but often gets overlooked. I knew a woman who escaped her abuser only to have some family member tell him where she was. He  dragged her back.  She thought he had the ability to find her wherever she went. (This was in the 80's so no apple tracking devices. )I tried to tell her that her meth addicted husband doesn't have an inside with the government to track her down but she believed him because she couldn't accept that someone in her family betrayed her.

Someone very close to me had their father-who they adored- tell them to go back with the abusive asshole because she had a child.","Right. What happens is, the longer she's pretty much forced to stay with him, the less hope and mental ability she has to leave. Despite what it looks like it is a form of brain washing. 

When I was in a safe house a therapist or someone ( don't remember who she was, not a lot was registering at that point, I was just terrified ) gave a group talk. Onus was how not to go back to an abuser.

Asked her later "" How many go back? "" Seemed surreal to me, he didn't have his claws into me that deep yet and I had a baby to protect. She looked around, made this almost hopeless gesture said "" All of them "". I said "" I won't "". That doesn't make me special, like I said he didn't have his psycho claws deep enough into me yet . Also had amazing, very strong family support.

Please do report, every time. Might be someone not too far into a psycho's power to break free. Have always worried about those other women. And their kids- there were other kids in there too. Also wish that woman could know I didn't go back . The baby that was saved is now a doc. She knows about her father, goes to therapy and by a wonderful stroke of fortune he's dead.

712,You're also blaming the victim rather than acknowledging he refuses to release her from his violent control. Women are killed when they leave. Many women leave but are never free of the BS.

The obsession is unimaginable.,"> Sounds like you're making it about you and your experience rather than the potential danger that you could be stopping by calling.

Except I called the cops and you're looking for something that isn't there. i'm explaining why so many don't, it's that simple.

713,"This still has nothing to do with what I said. Stalking and obsessive exes are a major, massive issue, but one that is very difficult to deal with as laws aren't really designed to stop people who haven't broken significant laws. Stalkers are an issue around the world because people who follow you and call your work, try to get you fired haven't broken any laws by doing so yet. 

But again, that has nothing to do with anything I spoke about. Leaving someone, leaving the house you live with your partner in and are in a relationship with is what I'm talking about. How you deal with an ex who won't leave you alone is a completely different situation. For one thing you have to leave said relationship and stop living them to be in the situation you're talking about.

You said what I talked about was a jurisdiction issue, but you're talking about something that I didn't mention once.","WTAF? I left 5 years ago. All of them women I know who have left, upper middle class postgrad educated women are still being tormented by violent obsessive nut jobs who police and judiciary reward at every vindictive step they take.

ETA: despite your dirty deleted you're still ignoring what I've said about laws that exist that aren't enforced.

I do understand. I have been there, both as a child and as an adult. There's no way to help a person who doesn't want to be helped.","Not interfering leads to more opportunities of death and damage.  It gets worse even if you don't interfere.

My mom stopped slapping us and started throwing us against walls.  Neighbors made comments about how strict our household was.

She used to berate or pinch or slap. She started grabbing your hair and slamming heads against objects.

Finally, she knocked my father down the basement steps and then went down and grabbed his head to smash it against the concrete floor. Neighbors continued to laugh at my father. Blaming him for the horrible abuse he constantly took. They would rather make jokes about his masculinity. They would rather watch this for decades.

I overheard gossip as they stood outside staring toward our house.

Hoping one of the adults would know what to do. But all they ever did was ignore or mock our suffering. 

Calling the police on my own mother was so emotionally difficult. Because the abuse teaches you to freeze or fawn to keep things peaceful. Survival is protecting and coddling your abuser. If you can just be good enough, keep them happy and calm...well, if they get angry it's your fault. Not theirs

 Living in abuse is a fucked up survival mentality
 
Calling the police on her would be counter to survival. Your whole body breaks down even considering such a betrayal. Even if it's in defense of your siblings and father, the thing is their survival is also tied up in the abuser. Your every instinct goes against protecting yourself.

 I had to learn to discard wanting to survive.  The hope for anything improving had to die entirely. And I was finally able to do something so traitorous as calling the police for help.
 
It was something I was only able to learn once I lost all trust in the community.

They knew. They did nothing. 
 
Neighbors looking the other way just means you are a silent audience to whatever comes next. Maybe they leave. Maybe someone ends up dead.  But years of trauma will continue unchecked.

Interfering is better.  Even if it can occasionally be a catalyst.","Because they don't leave their abusive partner, and they get even worse treatment once the cops leave.

Most of the time I never run into people again so I never know how things turned out. But at least two of those women did find me after and say it might have saved their lives. How is that not something worth doing, especially when all it costs are a few minutes on the phone?

I understand that it can be overwhelming or sometimes even dangerous to intervene directly, but there’s no excuse for not at least calling for help when someone is in need.","Omg your story is so harrowing. This could have been me. My ex used to always resort to strangling me. It was his MO. 

No matter how loudly I screamed for help while trying to run away from him or talked about it with people practically begging for help, no one ever did. We even had roommates who KNEW and saw what was happening and would go in their room and lock the door rather than help or call the cops. Only once out of 3 years did the cops ever get called and I found out the next day they went to the wrong place and didn’t even follow up or try to find the true source.

I am currently in an undisclosed location with my 3rd child, running from her abusive dad. So, thank you so much for doing what you did.","Thank you for calling the police. 

I used to bartend years ago. I got a side gig catering rich peoples parties. After one, i got a call unreasonably early from my boss. He urgently wanted to know how much I’d served one particular couple. I hadn’t served them much at all. 

He got drunk and beat her to death later. She was screaming for help and nobody did.

716,"Right. I have a friend who was dating a girl a while back, and I suspected that she was abusing him. I knew him several years before he dated her, and we worked at the same place.

She told me that he was crazy, and abusive, and that he once put a cigarette out on her arm. Normally if anyone were to hear that you'd be alarmed for the woman. But this one was different. She told me this almost.... gleefully? And he was sitting there right next to her, not saying anything. As time passed, my friend was becoming increasingly sullen at work. She called him almost daily, accusing him of cheating on her. He would complain about her spending all of the money he had put in their joint account.

One day we all went out to eat somewhere and I think she said something I disagreed with, and logically explained why, which probably made her feel stupid. After that day, my friend started making excuses as to why he couldn't hang out after work anymore. On top of that, there were some other mutual friends they had that saw him as an abuser so they stopped hanging out with him. She was isolating him.

One day she texted me saying to stop giving advice to him. She claimed it was because his dad wanted them to only follow the advice of the couple's counselor they were supposedly both seeing.

I ended up messaging his dad on Facebook, and he was aware that she wasn't all that she was cracked up to be, and asked me to support his son, which I was going to do anyway.

Eventually they broke up, but was still wanting her to take him back. He was eventually served a restraining order. I went to the courtroom with him, but he accepted ended up not fighting it, and accepted the restraining order, which was the best thing he could have done. Because now he legally had to stay away from her (and vice versa).","I know what they wrote, but apparently people can't read what I wrote.

We do not know the motivations for those who do not interfere. Maybe they are weak. Or, maybe they were in the same situation as the victim just yesterday and are so triggered they freeze. Perhaps they are scared. Perhaps their own abuse has made them numb. Perhaps they are assholes. Who knows. But, to just lump them all together as ""weak"" is wrong - it is implying that someone needs to be perfect in these situations (and, I compared it to society's view of the perfect victim, too - one who leaves on the first offence and who behaves exactly as society expects - both are skewed views).

We need to focus our scorn on the *abusers*. Not the victims. Not the witnesses. They (the abusers) are the ones who are wrong here. When witnesses are called weak, we are blaming them for what happened, when it is the abuser who abused.","Theyre saying its weak not to call the cops or at least think twice about helping, not weak to stay with your abuser",">Weak.

I have called the cops many times. And, it did no good - the victim still stayed. This doesn't stop me from calling, even though I have always been afraid the abuser would figure out who called and come at me. That fear is legit.

I have also been in an abusive situation where I wouldn't have left (at the time) even if someone called the cops. I finally left on my own, but it took a lot for me to get there. Would you call me weak because I didn't leave? Because I was scared? I wouldn't call it weakness.

You admitted it yourself, you stayed right? So you were abused and stayed, how do your relationships change with everyone around you when they call the cops on you? Yes I've experienced it myself but we've literally all seen it. You're admitting to having been in the same situation yourself, rather than walking away you stayed.

719,"From what I remember reading, the police were most likely called but simply ignored the 911 calls until it was too late to save her. Police ignoring reports is a problem that continues to this day. Many people have called the police for burglaries and assaults, yet the police never show up then claim they were never called. 

There was even a recent case of a serial killer being captured after one of his victims escaped. Multiple people reported telling the police that women were going missing, yet the police never investigated because they claimed that there were no missing person reports made. Turns out, the police had been refusing to take missing person reports this entire time.","Okay. Two CLAIMED to have called police during the attack. But the police had 0 record of those.

I highly doubt the podcast is likely to be the one sole source of information that's correct.... and even then, I doubt it would change my mind on the bystanders not doing enough. 


As long as a few people knew there was a physical attack occurring, and none of them made any meaningful attempt to help... even check to make sure she got back inside safely.  Or keep calling the police until they got there. 
Then they didn't really do enough.","I would recommend listening to the You're Wrong About podcast on Kitty, as there are some wrong facts even in your current comment.","Thanks for the link... I read up on it a bit more just now.

Some people still saw her get stabbed, then stagger away out of view. None went outside to see if she was okay. 

The people that saw the 2nd attack, after he returned to rape and stab her more... 


No one saw the full series of events. But about about a dozen people saw part of it. 
Two men were aware she was stabbed, one guy in the 1st attack. One guy was aware of the stabbing from the 2nd attack. But many more saw a woman getting beaten, some dismissed it as a ""lovers quarrel"". They didn't think a woman was being murdered, just another victim of domestic violence. 

Two of the 12 called police. Only one person went outside, a 70yr old woman who held Kitty as she died. After she was stabbed and raped. 

I'm sorry but 2 people saw her get stabbed. One only called the police AFTER she was basically dead, AND the old lady found her and started shouting:

""Intoxicated that night, Ross heard noises and after deliberation, cracked open his door to investigate. He saw Genovese laying on the ground, still alive and attempting to speak, and Moseley stabbing her. He shut the door and called a friend to ask what to do. The friend said not to get involved.

Ross eventually climbed out of his window and went to a neighbors apartment. He called the police after hearing Sophie Farrar call for someone to do so. Ross’ explanation—“I didn’t want to get involved”—became the famous rejoinder of the Bystander Effect.""

721,"That's an interesting topic... thanks for the book recommendation, I might have to read it. There's definitely lots of bullying types in my workplace.

Seems like it might the workplace version of a pdf I got on reddit : ""Why does he do that"" by Lundy Bancroft.  Which focuses on abusive relationships iirc.


Idk. A long time ago, in middle school... i found out another girl was being raped by her father. I didn't tell a guidance counselor because I didn't want to make her situation worse. I've checked up on her facebook, and she seems to be well adjusted and living a happy life. But what if things turned poorly? She was always cutting her wrists (self harm, not suicidal)... what if she died? I probably would have regretted not speaking up. I'm glad she turned out okay. But I don't like to live with regrets, wondering if things would have turned out differently if I had just DONE something or said something. 


I might regret it if i get seriously and permanently hurt trying to help someone. But i definitely will regret it if I provide 0 help. If that makes sense.","Of course. 

There's an interesting book, *Nasty People and How To Avoid Being Hurt By Them.* (I think. It's been a while) It's more about manipulative workplace bully types, not physical abuse. But the lesson is the same - Why do people say/do nasty things? One main reason is because they don't feel good about themselves, and they boost their own self-esteem by putting others down. For the physically abusive, this means inflicting hurt so they can feel that they are superior, because deep down they know or suspect they are less than others and can ""prove"" this is not so by being the physically dominant.","If they're gonna hurt a victim for someone trying to save them, they were going to hurt the victim anyways. 

Interfering doesn't change anything when you have someone violent who is looking for an excuse to abuse.


Ie. The abuser will say ""I'm only doing this because you tried to escape"". But if they didn't try to escape? Then the abuser will say ""I'm only doing this because you didn't wash the dishes"". 

It's like how a cheater will always cheat... an abuser will always abuse. They just make up excuses and find anything wrong so they can try to explain their behavior. When deep down it's just that they're fucked up.","Very good points. 

Except - nowadays, a bully knows the power of a phone and will see any move to call, record, or whatever as a provocative move. And, they are unpredictable. Stand well back, be ready to run. 

I'm an average height, slightly(?) overweight guy - but I haven't been in a serious fight since grade school. I seriously doubt I could take on some guy who has a habit of physical violence and a berserker attitude where they could be aggressive without regard to themselves getting hurt.  I don't want to find out the hard way, because if I lose the victim- if they don't want to leave - is no better off than when I started. Most likely worse, now the guy is angrier. ""See what trouble you brough onto me!!??""","Calling 911 takes less than a minute, assuming you know where you are. (And you should always know where you are tbh, pay attention to street names and businesses nearby... or look for a nearby house #). 

Then hit record on your phone. To get video of the person and what they look like. What they're doing. 

Telling them you called the police and are recording them will often get some to stop without a physical altercation. 


It can be a bit more obvious if they're on drugs or drunk... in that case just keep your distance. 
It shouldn't be too hard to outrun a drunk if you're in even half decent shape. 


I'm a petite woman who weighs just over 100lbs. Doesn't mean i would just run and hope the police or someone else did something. If i get hurt. Then i get hurt. But at least i wasn't a coward who stood by and didn't even try to help someone being actively hurt. 


Granted, physically interfering depends case by case. If you see a stranger attacking someone for no reason (ie a random street attack or something), then take into account, can you AND the victim handle the stranger? Are there any makeshift weapons you can use nearby? 


Domestics are a bit different. Because the victim has to be the one to want to leave. And if they aren't ready to leave their abuser, they'll likely attack you or get mad at you for interfering. And let's be real, there are very few cases where a woman is being locked in a house and 100% unable to physically leave. They usually stay out of a misguided sense of love. And repeatedly willingly go back home to their abuser.","The problem is... what are you going to do?  The aggressor is likely drunk, and obviously acting irrationally. Unless you're the type who can definitely win a no-hold-barred bar fight, the moment you get involved you put yourself at risk. 

Calling the police is obviously the best idea. However, you are dealing with an irrational violent person. If you even open your door or knock on theirs  to tell him off, and then the police show up, he may simply blame the person who told him off. Just call the police and let them handle it.","This.

We fear them and many people try to hide from the truth, that bad things do happen.

Either your doctor wasn't doing it correctly or you might have a condition that gives you higher sensitivity but I would at least talk about it with your PCP if you don't feel comfortable mentioning it to your OBGYN.,Can I ask how you got through it? I had one on Wednesday and it hurt so bad it was unbearable and I had to ask her to stop.,"Oh yeah, I just wasn't prepared for it to hurt but I got through it.",How much did it hurt? Like was your doc able to do the whole pap smear?,"I'm not sure what it's ""supposed"" to be, but mine wasn't painless"
724,"Okay, that's fair. Online it's kind of skewed but when I asked two friends of mine and they said that it different didn't hurt them that bad and that it's kind of concerning if it does lol","Nah it's not considered ""painful"". Like when I think painful I think endoscopy, or getting a plasma draw (basically anything with a big needle.) But I've never heard of pap smears being considered one of the painful procedures.",Is it like not? I've been doing probably way too much reading online on pap smears and I've seen things saying it's usually painless and then other things saying it's commonly painful... So idk about you but I don't actually know how it's supposed to be?,"Yeah I mean if it was a procedure that was widely known as being maximum level uncomfortable, outdated, old-fashioned...I would have a different opinion.","That's actually insane that so many women on here can convince themselves to get through it, I don't understand how y'all do it. I was telling myself the same stuff at my appt, on god, and it was still unbearable.","Yeah, there was something that helped me, I sort of just told myself over and over it will be over in a minute, I trust this doctor, she has a careful touch so I trust her...basically just taking deep breaths and trusting that the doctor knows what she is doing.
I think it's good they rescheduled, no need to start again right after quitting, that was nice of them. Better to wait it out then retry later.",I just had a pap smear done and I really wanted to get it over with and done too but I just couldn't. I even asked them after I got dressed if we could try again but they didn't want to because it went so bad. I know it's for my health to get it done so I rescheduled of course but I'm really stressed out and I think it's once again not gonna work. Was there anything in particular that helped you when it hurt?,"Yeah in short, the second time it hurt a little bit more than I expected it to. I did let her finish the exam because I trust her as she's a doctor (and the nurses also did there best with me, like asking if I prefer a female doc or if either female or male is fine. I felt more prepared because I knew they took the time to check that with me, for instance.) And I wanted to finish the pap smear since I went all the way there to get it done, because preventative treatment is better than treating something that's blown out of proportion, just trying to stay healthy etc."
725,"She didn't put any fingers in, when do they do that? 

She also didn't say that it being so painful was abnormal. I think maybe I should ask her about it","Yes. It’s similar to when they put their fingers inside you to check your ovaries, or when you insert a tampon. Not a “fun” feeling, but not painful","Is that how it is for you? Like they just put it in and open it quickly and it's completely fine?

I know these questions are dumb as hell and I'm sorry but you're legit blowing my mind","No. It’s just something being inserted into the vagina, it’s not by itself a process that should have any pain associated with it.",Wait really? The speculum part shouldn't hurt?,"The speculum being inserted and opened should be painless. I wouldn’t call that part fun, you wouldn’t just go have that done to yourself because it feels good, but that is not a painful thing at all. More just discomfort or feeling weird or odd.","She told me they were quick! I could barely get past the speculum being inserted though, and every time she actually tried to open it the pain was so intense. I just don't know if how much I hurt is normal and if I should just bear it when it should be quick","Painless no. It’s quick though, you just have to let them get the cells. It takes seconds"
726,So many women are telling you it’s offensive and you’re choosing to die on this hill. I wonder how many generalizations the women on this sub could make about men like you…,"There isn’t a problem. When that happens you respect how that person wants to be referred to. Which is how you should treat everyone. Until then, female and male are not offensive in nature.","If a woman doesn’t want to be called a female, what’s the problem?","That was a cute attempt at an insult. I understand what kind of person you are. I’m not gonna bite on your bait though.

 I just use the terms Male and Female outside of casual conversation to avoid any issues. Thank you for inquiring.","If you’re describing people in a scientific study, sure.  

A woman is an adult.  A girl is a child.  It’s pretty straightforward.  There are actually adjectives to differentiate age if that’s relevant (it often isn’t).  If you’re skittish about calling a 22-year-old a woman, I think that’s a you problem.",Of course you can. Though they do denote an age also. The better terms to use when appropriate would still be male and female.,So men and women aren’t words you can use?,"I’m honestly not sure and I’ve been shocked to hear it. I use male and female, I deal with adults. You really shouldn’t be using boys and girls outside of casual company, both have been used to demean and insult. Male and Female are the proper terms and should be used where appropriate."
727,"Just a heads-up, do NOT use lotion on your fingers or anything while inserting them inside your vagina.
Lotions/soaps/creams all can change the pH balance inside your vagina and cause unneeded issues. As they have a lot of chemicals in them and such. Not sure about coconut oil as well.

I would suggest you use proper lube/lubricant that is used for sexual purposes, they're specifically made keeping pH and everything in mind.","Thank you but I'd rather have someone else(that is trust worthy) to do it, but I doubt anyone would want to help me with it😅",I would trim and file your fingernail — you don’t want anything to be sharp and pokey. Then use something to make your finger slippery — maybe a dab of lotion or coconut oil. And then just move very slowly and gently. You will be okay.,"I know this sounds weird but I'm scared to push in my finger in there, I'm clumsy so I'm scared of hurting myself, but also because I'm scared of everything 😅","I never had that problem so I am not sure. The pill is not large. Can you get a finger in? If you can, that is plenty of room for a suppository.","Ok, but how do you insert it when you're a virgin? I tried many times with a dildo, but then I get a uncomfortable/painful feeling even when I didn't insert it, I just push in a little and it hurts, so how would I push in a pill? I'm scared of pain and I really can't tolerate/handle it so idk.","Boric acid is a certain type of acid that is generally in the form of a powder that can be put into a capsule. A suppository means that you use it by inserting it into your vagina. What it does is get everything in there the right pH, which allows the healthy microorganisms to grow and kills off the unhelpful microorganisms.","How do they work? What is boric acid? And what is ""suppositories""?"

I wanted to see if my emotions were volatile due to hormones…nope just me 😂,"Just curious, was yours the copper one or hormonal?",I just responded to OP as well. My IUD caused horrible UTI/BV problems that only went away when that devil device got removed,Dude you have an IUD? I just saw your post history. You definitely need to see a gyno or women’s health NP or something. IUD increases risk for ectopic and PID. Could be implanted somewhere it shouldn’t be. Go to Planned Parenthood if you have no other options,Yeah that’s been an issue. Can’t find a good gyno :(,"I agree. The pain in the side thing could mean there’s more going on depending what OP means by that. OP needs lab work, a pelvic exam, and possibly imaging not just prescriptions willy nilly for BV and yeast infections. See a good gyno.","Your husband should see you as a human being in pain.

Yes, Nexplanon is a type of hormonal birth control. It contains the active drug etonogestrel, which belongs to a drug class called progestins.

735,"> if you genuinely don't trust your SA with sex

It's usually shortened SO for significant other, SA tends to mean sexual assault.","For lots of guys, throat fucking is a kink, including for me. I've only ever been able to do it a few times because most women don't like that gag reflex, and I totally respect that. Just make sure to set boundaries beforehand, and if your SA violate those boundaries, consider leaving. This is just to say that this kind of kink isn't far-fetched by any means. Hell, it's an entire category of its own on most porn sites. On the other hand, I've had gfs whose kink was rough play/hands tied/light slapping. This is not a kink for me at all and I feel super weird slapping a girl, even if it turns her on. I guess we're all very different and we all have our own kinks. Just make sure to set boundaries beforehand and make it clear that a violation of those boundaries will result in you leaving.

In this particular case, I think only you can make this decision. Like you mentioned, I don't know if your past sexual trauma is leaking into this situation or if you genuinely don't trust your SA with sex anymore. Look deep within yourself and decide how you feel about the whole thing and go from there. Don't listen to all of us as only you can gauge whether he is being genuinely sincere and whether you can move past this.

A normal spouse would ask if their partner is comfortable if anything out of the ordinary happens. And forgetting to be gentle? The fuck? Is he a roided up animal or what?","People who ""forget"" boundaries are lying. I have a friend who's in an open relationship, with the caveat that it's only when they're apart and they do not discuss their hookups by the request of my friend. All well and good. Except his boyfriend *repeatedly* ""forgets"" and tells him all of his escapades, which deeply hurts my friend, who has to re-establish boundaries, who then gets hurt again the same way. It got to the point that I had to tell him straight-up that this is not his boyfriend being inexperienced or forgetful, this is his boyfriend getting off on the power over him.

738,"Oh my God, that's horrifyingly",The reports that a record number of teenaged girls are being admitted to the hospital for anal tears makes me deeply uncomfortable and sad,"This. You immediately get branded as not being sex positive if you want to have a frank discussion about the increasing misogyny in porn or the bdsm crowd (which seems like everyone now.) I have a teen niece who talks to me, and know that so many of these girls believe that they have to do anything a boy wants to be desirable, even if it feels terrible. 90% of the porn online these days is extremely degrading to women, and this is mainstream now, not even seen as kink. Violently skull f'ing, hair pulling, spitting on women, calling them whores, slapping their faces, coming on their faces/tongues, etc. is all totally normalized as mainstream, not even branded as kink. I'm sex positive, but I think a lot of girls have been bamboozled into accepting sexual aggression and misogyny by shaming them for supposedly not being sex positive or cool if they don't want to be treated like garbage cans. Somehow I feel like our feminism has been used against us in today's culture to trick us into doing sh\*t that feels degrading and painful. I'm uncomfortable with the turn it has taken. 

I can't help but think of Armie Hammer, using the guise of BDSM to rape and abuse very young women, telling them they don't need a safe word and they belong to him to do anything he wants with them, burning them, carving his initials in their skin, biting them, beating them, choking them, all without explicit consent, going well beyond their limits and providing no aftercare when he left them behind, bleeding and severely bruised. All of that was done in the name of kink, and he thinks that just because he talked them into being tied up, that they no longer could withdraw consent for any act he chose to do to them.

742,"The harm from kink shaming is so minuscule relative to the harm of excusing sexual predators, so the BDSM person you mention seems more interested in the latter and I’d be suspicious they had ulterior motives.

I think it’s a safe bet that men who want to hurt women and use BDSM as a cover are more likely to have deeply ingrained misogyny that they can’t hide, whereas people whose sexuality is defined by kink and would be just as horrified as anyone else at the thought of actually hurting someone likely have a better understanding of interpersonal and societal power dynamics","I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to say that kink is like that in the majority of cases.

NONE OF THAT SHIT IS NORMAL. Women internalize this shit as young girls, and men internalize this shit as young boys.

We live in a country that really lacks in sexual education, and yet, porn is everywhere. That's pretty much what young children are getting as a sex ed.

Which is also largely unregulated and does not practice safe sex. People in porn circles DIE because of the rampant STDs that happen. Yet the porn industry doesn't give a shit about them, they just keep on keep on, refusing to get their male actors to wear condoms and practicing questionable business practices. You may be unaware of that side of it, but the porn industry is seedy as fuck in every possible way. 

I am very sex positive and don't have any pearls to clutch. But porn just keeps getting more and more extreme, and further and further away from what real sex is.","I highly doubt all these things you are clutching your pearls over are as new as pornography is, it’s more like we as a society have changed and people are more open and comfortable discussing their sexual proclivities. I’m also unsure why you keep trying to demonize porn, it can 100% be part of a healthy sex life (whether single or in a relationship), and you may be surprised to learn that not only do plenty of women watch porn, they also watch it with their partners and use it to open up discussions about mutual fantasies and kinks. Porn is a huge industry and there is literally something for everyone, some people really like the more hard core stuff (and there is plenty of it), but there are lots of people who like gentler, more female pleasure and couple/romance focused porn (and there is plenty of this as well).","In this case it wasn't. So why feel the need to defend it? Also, this, and also the guy ejaculating on a girl's face wasn't a thing until porn came alone. That shit is weird porn stuff that has become normal since most people now watch porn.","If you need something to blame, sure. People are just into things. Doesn't gotta be your cup of tea. Isn't mine either, but I'll defend it as long as it's consensual",How fucking horrifying! I just can't imagine having respect for someone and then making them throw up. That's just so......disrespectful to me. I think this must be a product of watching so much porn.,"There are lots (probably not millions, but lots) of couples where throwing up is just a ""normal"" part of rough oral. Strange, sure, but not totally rare.","Wait, you threw up and he kept going? Can you explain more? Did you throw up a tiny bit in your mouth and he had no idea that happened? Or did he witness you actually puke and think “sooo sexy let’s ram that cock in there some more!!”

Because the first one is clueless and thoughtless, the second one is actively and intentionally cruel. I cannot on any planet imagine making my partner throw up and continue doing the same sex act like nothing happened."
752,"Yes. 

Can you not see that there is another issue as well,  if it's a new behaviour??","It. Doesn't. Matter.

It doesn't matter if he made her throw up with her consent every other time they had sex. She set her boundary \*for this time\* and he completely disregarded it and assaulted her.","Yes,  agreed. 

If he did something pretty extreme that was new then I would say the situation is very different from doing something normal for them that looks extreme from the outside. 

I'm just asking so I understand. 

It could be more concerning or less concerning depending on the answer.",People can change any boundary at any time. If that's not respected* that's SA. He knew she didn't want it rough and did it anyway.,"I think it does matter :)  It does not make it OK even if it's normal for them,  but it does change the background. Even in this discussion,  we started with the act itself and now we are talking about what she asked for. They both potentially matter,  but we can't know without asking :)","She said she wanted it to be gentle this time, it doesn't matter how rough the previous sessions were.","If it's normal for them,  then that is relevant.  

We can't tell two consenting adults what they can do. Or rather,  we can,  but that's about what we like and not what they like :)","Why is it important, when he made her vomit *and held her down while he kept going*?"

Logically, extreme violence is an indicator that the perpetrator **is not** mentally ill, so they should be handled with a level of wariness that **exceeds** that used around people who are genuinely mentally ill. 

The violent perpetrator has the greater capacity to assess, plan, mislead, and enact violence - a true and ongoing threat to anyone who gets close enough. 

People are unsettled by the perception of unpredictability in a mentally ill person, but perceived threat does not translate to actual threat. The average person wants to think that a sane person (as they think they themselves are) is not capable of such brutality. Spolier: some humans just suck.

Thinking mental illness = threat is a bias I wish everyone would examine within themselves. The world could be a kinder place if we did.","Thank you!

765,"I remember watching a true crime doc about a teenage girl who lured a 12yo girl into her car and took her out to this place in the woods and brutally tortured her before killing her. And unsurprisingly it turned out her parents had done some truly horrifying things to her throughout her short life. It made me so sad that the teenage girl, though she was the one who actually did the horrible acts to the other girl, was to be punished for the rest of her life because of what her parents had done to her. It disturbed me that her parents wouldn't even get punished for what they did either. Our society is all about pointing the finger and calling it justice and then we're shocked that horrible things keep happening. I think people have a hard time understanding that trying to help, to rehabilitate, to prevent, to teach, etc. is not the same as excusing horrible actions. 

I'm very sorry about your uncle.","People are so supportive of trauma victims—until they admit to committing some heinous crime during a trauma response, that is. Once victim becomes victimizer we call them depraved monsters. My dad used to say your empathy isn’t worth much if you can only empathize with people you understand, and I think that applies here. I really don’t think anyone *set outs* to become a sociopath.

I’ll never forget my mom telling me about my kind and mind-mannered uncle coming back from Vietnam asa very young man and maniacally running down a dog in the road. He later said he couldn’t clearly recall the incident, and was really disturbed by it happening. He also experienced what everyone called “extreme fits of jealousy” when he later married the love of his life, a widow to a young man who died in Vietnam, whose photos he would violently smash while hyperventilating. It seemed clear to me that there was a hell of a lot more to it than just “jealousy”.

I’ve been in relationships with people who were badly abused as children and have seen a couple different versions of trauma responses. When that shit hits, I really don’t think people have control. They become strangers to me, but also to themselves. These were people whose abuse ended by elementary school yet it clearly affected them deeply. Even with a therapist, with family support and a very motivated individual, it is really, really hard to undo that damage. And most people aren’t getting any of that.

I’m fairly sure there are statistics on this and the fact is that a significant portion of violent offenders in prison have experienced significant trauma. You can absolutely fuck up basic human development, like self-regulation and empathy, with the right combo of trauma and lack of support.

ETA: And I honestly don’t know why people act like suggesting there could be some reason humans seem more capable of heinous violence in some geographic regions vs others is “letting people off”, but I suspect it had something to do with the “justice=punishment” mindset that puts dangerous people in concrete boxes with each other so they can become even more poorly-suited due release into society.","I don't want to argue with you because I've got the whole gamut of mental illness myself, but it is very very common for abusers to have been abused themselves. They are often mentally ill. Well-adjusted people do not abuse others. And pointing out the mental damage that using violence as punishment for children causes can help teach folks to stop doing stuff like that. In general I don't think acknowledging the mental health of violent and abusive people is meant to demonize everyone with mental illness as violent, it's more so acknowledging that being violent is not normal and it often occurs because of abuse by caregivers.","Thank you!

It really depends on how much information you gave the vendor. It also kind of depends on how many of these credit care disputes they get.","Thank you for responding! 

Can the company not cross-reference the disputed amount with the charges in their customer database? 

Based on their responses to the google reviews, I wouldn't be surprised if they retaliated out of petty spite.","My parents owned a small business, and as a result I got a chance to read over and respond to the disputes. The merchants don't get information like your name, address, phone number or anything. Of your credit card number, the middle 8 digits are X'ed out. They get to see the reasons why you are disputing the charge and some basic instructions on how the merchant can respond with their side of the story. If they don't respond, you win by default (provided the dispute resolution agent can fit your complaints into a valid category).

There is a risk of retaliation, but it somewhat depends on what information you gave them already. If you didn't leave your name or address, then there's almost no chance of it happening.

Of the credit card disputes I've been involved in (which admittedly isn't much), there hasn't been any retaliation.

Further, from a merchant's perspective, it kind of doesn't make sense to retaliate. The money's gone. Retaliation won't bring back the disputed charges, can result in more bad reviews, and can land them in trouble with the law. It isn't worth it for a business owner. And the employees certainly aren't going to care enough to retaliate.",My only concern is that once my cc does the chargeback they'll know my identity and may attempt to retaliate against me.,I've gone this route myself and then helped friends and family resolve disputes as well a handful of times.

No joke, that is insane and incredibly evil. I'm actually shocked right now that you were able to name every single tactic and strategy they used from beginning to end. I'm very impressed.","If they post their prices, it allows you to price-shop. There is literally more than one training package (I paid to do one) where they teach this. It's called IPS (in person selling, super creative /s) and relies on holding your images hostage, together with every single dodgy sales technique to pressure you into buying a package. 

I'll wager they used reciprocality ( I gave you a shoot, you owe me one), the sunk cost fallacy (well you've already spent the time/effort, and you wouldn't want to lose that, right?). Not to mention going through each and every image, taking over an hour, and wearing you down until you would give them your money simply to get out of there.

It's a ""sales system"", and it's evil.","It definitely felt like the owner (who is male) set this up to purposefully be disingenuous. Also, why don't they post the prices on their website? How is that so hard to do?","I genuinely feel bad for you.  Photographers like this ruin the industry,  for both the customer and other photographers.  And yes,  the fake claim of ""female empowerment"" is particularly grating as  this was a male photographer exploiting a power dynamic to rip you off.","I think if only one or two aspects had been bad, I would've been able to look beyond that and still enjoy myself and the end results. But to have so many things leave a terrible taste in my mouth, end up with photos i absolutely dislike, and to come out of it feeling so bad about myself because they didn't listen to me at all, is literally the opposite of what they were claiming their photoshoots were all about (which was wOmeN's eMpoWeRmeNt). Yes, way to empower me by not listening to me at all.","Me and my wife tried running a boudoir studio for a while,  but quit because we couldn't stay afloat without these predatory business practices, such as the ""free "" shoot that is anything but.

Sorry to hear about your bad experiences,  but from the business side at least, this is par for the course. 

The MUA/pinterest complaints are very valid though. If they want to charge premium prices ( which they do) then they have to provide a premium experience. 

We still do it for fun, and if you were in New Zealand I'd offer to do a shoot for you, but you may have success going on to photography groups and looking for people who do it for the love of the game,  instead of just as a paycheck.  That opens up a slew of other issues (like pervs posing as photographers) so I do feel compassion for women who simply want good shots at a decent price."

[Here's an example of someone misinterpreting it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/5i6m5y/women_have_unrealistic_views_of_how_men_look/)

Here's the quote that everyone seems to notice: 

>women rate an incredible 80% of guys as worse-looking than medium.

Here's the *entire* rest of the point that everyone seems to miss:

>when it comes to actual messaging, women shift their expectations only just slightly ahead of the curve, which is a healthier pattern than guys’ pursuing the all-but-unattainable.

Women message men at a rate that's on a pretty realistic bell curve, even though they're not ""rating"" them as highly. It's MEN who only reach out to the ""hottest"" women.

And just another big obvious point: look at the ""average"" women's pics in the post. They're posed. Well lit. The women are wearing nice clothes. An effort was made. The photos are showing these women at their best, they're flattering.

Look at the example men's pics in the post. One has red eye ffs. They're not posed or well-lit. Only one out of four comes close, in my opinion, to showing how attractive that dude probably is IRL.

What this ACTUALLY shows is that women do not think men's *profile pictures* are very flattering. 

And I'd ask anyone who's ever glanced at a dating site, do you honestly think they are? Do you think men usually put effort into their pics? 

Because just looking around, I'd say, no shit sherlock to all of this, people aren't very attractive in unflattering pictures, and men seem on average to not put much effort into having flattering pictures on dating sites.",It originated from OK Cupid data.,"I believe that statistic originated from tinder/OLD, sounds like some genius has taken it out of context.","Lol they can't get a date on Tinder because all of the women have left the app. Isn't it something like 80% of Tinder users are men?

I get it, it’s difficult to put yourself out there.  Maybe you’re shy or lack confidence, maybe you have a hard time with all this.  But again, that’s when you ask friends for help.  Or family.  If you don’t have anyone in your life that supports you, you may be a lovely person but you need to work on developing your interpersonal skills before you get yourself into a relationship.  

But most guys are just being lazy.  Maybe it’s 30% fear, 70% laziness.  And it can turn into this angry ‘take me as I am’ kind of attitude.  One that extends to the rest of their life.  Chances are they don’t exactly take much time to clean their house.  Or themselves.

Once again for the folks in back: *other men shaming you is not something women can solve, so leave us out of it*","I didn't blame anyone for it. It doesn't matter who's at fault because the shaming is absolutely a thing that happens and I guarantee it's not going to stop in our lifetime no matter what any individual does, or at least not soon enough to matter for anyone reading this. OP asked the best way to approach the problem and I answered what and why.","Who shames them? Because it is not women who do that. And if men are shaming men for their sexual success or lack thereof this is a massive you problem that we cannot influence in any way externally. And we categorically not going to offer ourselves to prove a point. We are not playthings, we are people.","Getting involved earlier + empathy. Unsuccessful men get *hardcore* shamed, just think of the comment 'why can he get a relationship but not me?' for proof of that.

Visit any pick up or men’s sub and watch how men chastise women who reject or ignore them. Read how men demand attention and compliments. Watch them claim childfree women will spend their middle aged and elderly years lonely and miserable because their destiny and purpose is motherhood. 

Watch them blame women for failing to validate them, blame women for SA and catcalling. Make fun of women for fashion choices and going to the gym. 


In short, who gives a fuck what they think? They limit women to subservient, subordinate roles to men. Let those men wallow and suffer alone. They can choose to treat women as human beings with the same natural rights to happiness and autonomy. Those who don’t?

803,"Love how you can speak for all men and putting down ""women like me"" for having reasonable standards and trying to fear monger me for the time I get older. What are you projecting onto me?

There's a multitude of reasons for men or women being single or not. Ever thought that more older women are single by choice because they prefer it that way because the relationship before wasn't working anymore and men stay in the relationship because it benefits them more emotionally?

There are multiple variables playing into this. Women also tend to live longer than men, among the single women over 65 are most likely also quite a lot of widows. How does the percentage of single people say anything about their desirability anyway? There are people who are desirable, but who are still single. Some people just get into relationships out of fear of being alone or for stability.

I don't even actively date at my current age, so if I were a guy, my life would pretty much be the same because I don't date either way. Or at least I'm not actively looking. 

I've seen so many socalled average Joes having girlfriends and being generally quite successful with dating. And no, they're not the top 10% of men, they're your everyday guy from next door that don't really stand out from the mass, but they found someone that matches them.

It's usually the ones being insecure or having poor social skills who might have a depressing experience with dating, men or women. Or they just had bad luck.

All I said was that you shouldn't depend your happiness on a relationship and this applies to every sex and you're coming with statistics to proove that women become less desirable among the broad mass, even though no one was talking about this.
My point still stands regardless.
It's far more complicated than ""young women are too picky because they're still pretty and have more options until they get older"". Numbers are not telling the whole story.","What exactly implies that I think too high of myself? Because I said that I enjoy my own company and don't let myself pressure into a relationship? Please.
Also since when is online dating reflective of the real world? Tinder works much differently than meeting someone in the real world and most people only use Tinder for hookups anyway.
It could be that women's desirability on online dating declines more after a certain age compared to men's desirability, but why would I care? I don't use online dating anyway and when I'm older, I don't want anything to do with men in their midlife crisis who look for women the same age as their daughter or niece.
Like if less men are into me when I'm older, it doesn't matter because it only takes one person to click with for a relationship. Quality over quantity.","Girl even in online dating it's show women have much much steeper decline in desirability compared to men their age .that women when they are in their 40s men start becoming more desirable than them in dating(if you want to me to link the studies I can do it.they are reliable they have 200k big ass sample size)

This literally online dating the platform that women 90%  the power in dating.

I actually think older women are extremely attractive I don't believe this incel rehotic that women age badly .

But ask in guy in their 30s and tell them how dating was in their early 20s and they probably will have PTSD from how young women pickinees.

. I agree with all your statements and I don't side you friend but you seem to think too high of your self because you think you're independent women who enjoy her time alone. But let's be serious try being average Joe in his  20s and let's see how you respond to loneliness and singleness.

TLDR:  I agree with you in everything in this post but I still think you're pretentious young beautiful woman who say that she enjoy being single and say ""singleness isn't bad"" because she has power in dating over men because she is attractive young women. 
That why I'm telling you get old and let's see how you respond to singleness when men start being picky.","Don't even try the old ""hitting the wall in your 30s"" line like women turn into ugly hags the day they turn 35, that's bs.
Men have their right to be picky as much as I do and if they don't want me, they don't want me. If I don't want them, I don't want them, simple as that. There will always be people willing to date, no matter at what age and if an older guy only wants to date younger women, so be it. You say yourself they're apparently shitty, so why would I want to be with them then? If a man in his mid 30s has unrealistic expectations, that's not a man, that's a manchild.
I like cats btw.",">Is he physically attractive?

Eh, he looks alright, average, I'd say, but not my type at all.

>Is he trying to be your ""nice guy""?

I hope not, and I don't have a bf.

>How's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' POV? Where is him empathy?

He is able to understand others' POV, but when it comes to this topic, he has tunnel vision, unfortunately. Usually, he is kind, takes care of his friends, is considerate towards everyone. It's not as black and white and it seems like once the topic of being alone is mentioned, his inner demons come out. I understand your sentiment though and appreciate your empathy with me! I'll set much stronger boundaries with him for sure.","How's he a good and kind guy if he can't understand others' POV? Where is him empathy? Is he physically attractive? He literally treats half of the population as subhuman. Is he trying to be your ""nice guy""? Do you have a bf? Once you have a bf, he probably will be mad at you, disappear and talk smack behind you.","Oof you read him like an open book 😅 

He is pretty much looking for someone doing the emotional labor. During the conversation, I felt like he was dumping all his sorrow onto me and I could just try to shield it off of me, without any consideration of how it makes me feel when I try to encourage him and he just keeps wallowing in self pity.

I mean I don't think he's deliberately trying to manipulate, but more or less subconsciously. But I think you're right, I had a similar talk with him this summer and what triggered it was that while we were talking about the topic of dating and whether love at first sight is a thing or not, I said that attraction at first sight is definitely a thing and that I do pay attention to the way a guy looks and the way he carries himself.

Meaning I want to be physically attracted. I didn't mean I want my man to look like some sort of model, just someone who I find cute in his own imperfect way. Of course personality is important, but I do need that attraction, the chemistry. Not that much of a revolutionary concept, isn't it? lol To him it apparently is.

It could very well be that this completely normal statement made him mad because it showed him that women care about more than the bare minimum and are not as desperate as him. Just like with my best friend ""Emily"" from the post, just hearing that a woman is also able to be happy without a man made him bitter enough to react like that.

Coming to think of it, he is talking a lot about financial topics and his plans in that regard and is always talking endlessly about the details of a certain topic that could have been compressed into one or two sentences (to a point where no one is even really listening anymore because no one cares that much) and to lowkey try to impress people with his intelligence.

The thing is, apart from that he's a good guy, but he has a crap ton of issues he needs to unpack, but he doesn't realize that. Otherwise he's fun to be around but whenever that topic comes up, it's exhausting. I feel kinda torn because I don't want to ditch him as a person completely, but if he keeps getting on my nerves like that, I have to ask myself if I want to keep hanging out with a guy like that or have an honest talk with him. Because dating wise, I'd never entertain a guy like him either.","He sounds like a typical low emotional intelligence guy to me. Instead of working and self reflecting he just continues the denial and it snowballs into inceldom. 

Men like this are desperate because they’re relying on their partner to fulfill a lot of their needs. Self acceptance, stability.. sometimes even entertainment. So not having a partner is just him bouncing to one side of the room to the other because he can’t work on his own self acceptance or entertain himself properly. He desperately doesn’t want to be “alone” because he dumps basic human needs on women. It’s like walking around with a huge basket of dirty clothes and crying that you need it washed asap (only by a woman) because you never bothered to learn how to do it yourself. 

These guys also love to strategize relationships because they don’t see the other gender as an equal. It’s always a red flag when someone is ok with potentially “manipulating” their way into having and maintaining a relationship. Like pick up artist culture. 
Of course he is not going to like women having their own standards and wanting to be with attractive men.. that means he can’t control or manipulate them into dating him. They use money/income, social status, “intelligence” as date baits and it’s pathetic.

I don’t think it’s worth the time and effort to deal with these guys anymore, seriously. They’re tricky and insecure enough to try to bring you down with them."
