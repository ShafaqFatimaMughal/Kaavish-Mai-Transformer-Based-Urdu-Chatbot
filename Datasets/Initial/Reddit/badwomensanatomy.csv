(/s)",I....have no words.,This post mostly lmao https://i.redd.it/r94yxggftpo11.jpg,What's the story behind your flair?,No.,"Can I post a pic of my bondage bear teddy art? On Sunday, of course!! ;)","Pretty much, you just give it a prompt and get a result within a minute or even less. That's why we consider it low effort, not because of our personal views on whether it is legitimate art or not.

Not accusing you of anything, just hoping to clarify. <3","They are Artificial Intelligence that makes art. How I believe it works is you input something you want it to draw (ex. Tree) and it scans the internet for images of trees and makes one as art. 

It‚Äôs a pretty contentious thing rn since some people say it isn‚Äôt even art and it takes away from human artists, etc."
1,"Interesting. 

Now there is more to learn and to read about because my mind isnt capable of finding peace when i have questions. 

If by casuality someone that knows about science, psychology, neurology or anything could come and teach us a few things about this conversation, i would be happy.","Personally, I'm not asexual, but not strictly allosexual either (autistic, demisexual etc.). I used to be somewhat repulsed by genitals despite very open upbringing, no religious or moral baggage, no trauma, good education. Heck, I grew up pagan with the whole feminist mother nature vulva/phallus worship slant. 

Exposure in both the sexual sense and non-sexual (naturist) setting alleviated that, but it's kinda ""Schr√∂dinger's neutral"" - I'm simultaneously indifferent, positive (in a theoretical appreciation way) and repulsed. I'm not sex-repulsed, so that allowed me positive interaction with genitals. A sex-repulsed asexual doesn't have that option, and even my ""training myself"" didn't fully remove the negative undercurrent. The social construct aspect is salvageable, and that would be sufficient for the majority of people, but the brain wiring isn't.","Im not certain about that. I've been working in a naturist camping. People hang out completely naked. Genitals then lose their ""sacred, sexual, hidden, whatever"" character. I strongly believe it is a social construct.

Obviously, when things get hot between persons, sex get sexy, but when having a coffee, it doesnt.

Where does repulsion come from ? Isnt it construction we made (conscient or inconscient) through our education ? I think it is something we learn to be, not native. 

>no amount of education is going to help a sex-repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.

You're probably right. I guess its too late for them, and learning not to be repulsed would be a hard work that i'm not sure they would want to do if they are ok like this. But i was talking before that. When we are children. 

And i'm reaaaally not saying being asexual is a problem that should be cured. I have nothing to say about asexuality (or any form of sexuality or asexuality) as long as people are happy with it. My concern is only about being repulsed by body parts. Concern being a big word here.","But the genitals do have a sexual connotation, no amount of education is going to help a sex-repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.","Well it is just my opinion and i'm not going to force it. 

I feel that any human should know the basic human anatomy, without disgust at all. We should be able to comprehend it without putting in any sexual aspect. But once again it is just my opinion, not backed by any science. But i feel people would be more relax about it if we could just see it as we see arms or ears. No emotions, just plain and cold.

See, im a hetero man, i have no attraction for men, but I can watch a male or female organ with no disgust, and even tell people if there's something wrong like a visible skin disease, and tell them to go get checked.

But it is my way of seeing life. I'm really convinced people should know more about anatomy. We hide everything so much that it becomes like a secret, it gets mystical for some, and creates frustration, bad behaviour and so on, just because. I really feel if we would just treat organs as we do for ears, some problems would be avoided. Not all, obviously, but some.

Once again, only my opinion, not forcing it. I'm curious about yours, if you mind explaining. I wont tell you're wrong or im right, i would just understand other people's opinions better, and that is very good.",Why would it matter if you‚Äôre attracted or repulsed by them if you‚Äôre not going to be near them or dictate what people should do because of what you believe.,"Its ok to be asexual, but I don't find it ok to be repulsed by human body parts. If you remove sex, there still is basic biology, anatomy, plain and cold.",People gotta learn that it‚Äôs okay to be asexual.

9,Fair enough I guess everyone‚Äôs experiences are different. My first gf I had zero idea what I was doing and thought discharge left on me was her cumming lol.

It's crazy how there's so much judgement around hair choice.","Choosing to shave, or not shave, should be a personal thing and not pushed by society. I cannot stand the feel of hair on certain parts of my body, but it doesn't bother me on others. Everyone should just do what they're comfortable with.","This is _exactly_ the reason I _don't_ shave.

Luckily these days people are generally more accepting, though I still get some looks of disgust. 

If someone doesn't find me attractive (for any reason) I am absolutely ok with that. The last time I shaved my body hair I felt like a child, it felt so unnerving seeing my body like that. I decided then that if someone is disgusted by my body hair then that's a 'them' problem.

18,"I actually don't shave my legs for the exact opposite reason. Well et least partially, mostly it's because I just personally don't care if I have leg hair or not, so why would I shave, but the few times I have shaved I've hated how my legs felt. Not how they felt when I touched them with my hand. In my hand I felt they were very soft and smooth, but how my legs specifically reacted when anything touched them. Something about not having hair makes my legs freak out and anything touching them feels super uncomfortable.

19,"Coconut oil has become my savior. Mixed with a little arrowroot, it's a great deodorant paste, as it has antibacterial properties (since bacteria=smell), or just by itself before I go out. Before I discovered the coconut oil, I would shave my pits once every two weeks.

I figure, I'm 41, hubby loves me for me, and if anyone takes issue with my body hair, I couldn't care less, as they neither control nor influence my life and body.

20,"Okay. I think more studies need to be done, but that study casts enough doubt that the ""pullout"" method should not be used as a form of birth control.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564677/,Got a source for that study?,This is a myth and outdated. A study showed that 40% of men do in fact release sperm in pre-ejaculate even after urinating (that was a control in the study).

30,"Yes, it was the special cocktail of the night.

Actual answer: my now ex husband used a jar to empty the turtle tank and left it half full in the kitchen. I came home thirsty from the Madrid heat and only realised the strange taste after I had drank the whole thing. My ex's aunt was also having a heart transplant at the time so we were both too stressed for common sense.

(Transplant went well, I didn't get salmonella, aunt is fine 13 years later, ex and I divorced but are still best friends and friends with our respective new partners, happy endings all around)",".........sooo which part was accidental?

Today on terrible ideas:","Not the culture I know that does virginity checks, because I'm that one they are carried out by women...

Edit to expand: In Spanish Roma culture you can either have a wedding or an ""arrejuntamiento"" (joining). A wedding brings more honor to the bride's family, and it includes the ritual of roses, where a designated elderly woman will stick a white handkerchief in the bride's vagina until the hymen tears a bit so they can show the ""roses"". 

Although the joining is also acceptable for many families,  it's going to depend on how tradicional the patriarch is so there is some trickery about it. It's sometimes possible to bribe the hymen checker so she'll prick her own finger, stuff chicken livers inside and whatnot.

There are also (although thankfully not common) bride kidnappings which is fucked up. Some years ago the family of a kid in the high school where my mom works kidnapped the girl he had a crush on to force her to marry him. It's a very hermetic community so it never transcended if she was raped or not or what consequences were brought upon the kidnappers family; as far as the school staff knows the police were brought only to report the girl missing and once she appeared they were asked to let it drop. Thankfully the girl's family was not traditional so they did not force her to marry the boy.",What culture is it?
31,That's a perfect example.,I could totally see that pervert Warren Jeffs doing something like this. Or any one of his cronies.,"Extremist Christianity might send the fianc√©e to a doctor for a check to make sure her hymen is intact, but I've never heard of any religion saying it's okay for a father-in-law to look at his prospective daughter-in-law's vagina!

37,"**[Body hair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_hair#:~:text=Harris, publishing in the British,have the most body hair)** 
 
 >Body hair, or androgenic hair, is the terminal hair that develops on the human body during and after puberty. It is differentiated from the head hair and less visible vellus hair, which is much finer and lighter in color. The growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of androgens (often referred to as male hormones) and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. Both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.

I have rarely seen a man or a woman with as much leg hair as this woman has.

That said, that's an extremely limited pool, and anecdotal. So let's do some generalizing.

The least hairy ethnicities, according to some googling, are Asians and native Americans. Combined, these groups make up around 60% of the global population. We can assume that the majority of these women have less leg hair than this woman does. Just going off of that alone shows use that the majority of women have less leg hair than this woman does.

But if we add in some other factors, there's more evidence. Body hair starts to decline around 50 in most people, due to hormonal changes. This woman is young, probably at peak hairy years. A significant portion of the population is older than 50, around 35%. We can assume that most of those women have less leg hair than this woman.

38,"That's why I added the generalizations with ethnicity. Idk why I'm getting downvoted here, I never made any judgements about body hair. Saying that this is an above average amount is not an insult. Some people have extra thick head hair too. Some women grow full beards, and most only have light facial hair or fuzz.","Honestly I have no idea if you're right or wrong about this (my leg hair is pale and fine but not exactly sparse so it might look this way if it were darker but either way I'm just one data point) BUT I have to imagine that the women you know who are comfortable with not shaving having sparser/finer leg hair than this is not entirely a coincidence. 

That is, if you're this hairy as a woman, you'd probably get a lot of comments and feel more pressure to remove or cover up the hair.  So if most of the upper end of this curve is just fully removed, then the only 'natural' leg hair you end up seeing is relatively non-noticable, giving the impression that most women, if they let their hair grow out, will have relatively non-noticable hair too.

I truly don't know the numbers, but I don't think you can rely much on anecdotal observation here.","Idk, around half of my female peers either don't shave or rarely shave, and the are less hairy than this. I have rarely seen a man or a woman with as much leg hair as this woman has.

That said, that's an extremely limited pool, and anecdotal. So let's do some generalizing.

The least hairy ethnicities, according to some googling, are Asians and native Americans. Combined, these groups make up around 60% of the global population. We can assume that the majority of these women have less leg hair than this woman does. Just going off of that alone shows use that the majority of women have less leg hair than this woman does.

39,"Yes, and most of the comments are about how it's okay not to shave and discussing the amount of leg hair. She uploaded the video in the first place to show the amount of leg hair because it was interesting. If it was not an above-average amount of leg hair it would not be interesting and no one would be talking about it.

Growing increased amounts of body hair while in a cast or similar device is a common occurrence. This is probably an unusual amount of leg hair even for this woman. Normally, friction from clothes and washing and daily activities rubs off some of the hair and skin cells. When a limb is protected like this that doesn't happen as much and people grow more hair for a while.

And aside from that, this woman calls herself a ""hairy girl"" and makes tons of videos capitalizing on it because she grows more body hair than most women and people find it interesting.

40,"It is not accurate (based on that study) to say most men prefer smaller labia or that most men do not like larger labia (or even that they have the very specific vulva preferences you list here). 

That study does not support your statements about men's preferences. In that study, 36% of men were neutral about genital appearance. They don't give the percentage of men who preferred smaller labia, just that more preferred smaller labia than larger labia. This does not mean that **most** men prefer smaller labia--after all, if 36% of men were neutral, that only leaves 64% of men that have a preference in either direction. The makeup of how many of those men preferred smaller to larger is not specified there (it could be 34% smaller to 30% larger, for example--leaving most men without a preference) nor is the strength of the preferences listed (strong preference versus mild).

I mean, in the results section they even say that most men did not have a strong preference for vulvar appearance and didn't feel it impacted sexual desire or pleasure.","yes, but their numbers is lower, and fetishism is not nessecarily the same as liking, let alone seing a person behind it...most men do not like it

46,"I think what I meant by ‚Äúmore potent‚Äù was moreso that I wouldn‚Äôt have to remember to take a pill to keep up the effectiveness, it would just work for a few years without me needing to think about it, yaknow? 

Definitely gonna check out that article and look up the disorder. I really appreciate you sharing that information. My GYN handles my contraceptives, but she and my psychiatrist would probably both want to know and discuss the possibility if I suspect anything following my reading. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I have it considering my litany of other health problems which all revolve around abnormal hormone and neurotransmitter levels. I‚Äôm actually on an SSRI and used to be able to raise my dosage slightly around my TOM to help control the psychiatric symptoms I get or have worse around that time, but unfortunately I can‚Äôt anymore because of a high risk of delayed-onset serotonin syndrome, which can be very dangerous if allowed to persist.

I‚Äôm actually 29 right now which is why I have so much uncertainty around whether or not I want to have children. -shrugs- I‚Äôm also very wary of getting something inserted under my skin. I‚Äôd probably have an anxiety attack or faint during the procedure. üòÖSo I don‚Äôt want to commit to that until I‚Äôm sure just to avoid the emotional stress.

I hope you spoil the hell out of all those kids *especially* since it‚Äôs not your problem if they annoy their parents afterwards.","I just asked my mum and she said her sister always had truly awful PMS symptoms but she was only diagnosed in her late 30 - after she chased someone with a knife üòß It‚Äôs called Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and she was put on a ‚Äúmood stabiliser‚Äù (my mums term - I suspect she means SSRI or barbiturate) as well as multiple forms of contraception. 

If you think you might have PMDD you should definitely bring it up with your GP. [This article might be of interest to you. ](https://journals.lww.com/indianjpsychiatry/Fulltext/2020/62050/Menstrual_psychosis__A_not_so_forgotten_reality.21.aspx) in terms of people thinking you‚Äôre a hypochondriac - particularly the case study of the woman who‚Äôs in-laws thought she was faking it and stopped treatment until she tried to harm their son. Seriously, wtf? 

And just a side note regarding ‚Äúmore potent birth control‚Äù, the implant is particularly good because your cycle returns to normal within a month of the implant being removed. It‚Äôs not more potent, just longer lasting for ease. It‚Äôs also more expensive because it‚Äôs longer lasting. In the UK they won‚Äôt put a woman on the implant if she has any intention of getting pregnant in the next 3 years because it‚Äôs a waste of NHS money to remove it again when shorter term methods are available. If you have really good private health insurance, I imagine this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Also, birth control isn‚Äôt measured in potency - consistent pill usage, IUD and implants all have the same ‚Äúpotency‚Äù in terms of you not getting pregnant (within 1-2%). The only issue is non reversible methods - injection rather than implant or pill, for example. You can‚Äôt take an injection out or stop taking it, you have to wait the 3 months until it‚Äôs warn off. 

If you definitely don‚Äôt want to have a child in the next 3 years, get the implant. It doesn‚Äôt impact your long term fertility levels or anything like that. And if for some reason you don‚Äôt like it/it causes side effects/you suddenly decided you want to have a baby right now, you can just have it removed and be good to go in 4 weeks. 

Thank you for the good wishes! When I was 28-33ish and every single person I knew was having children, it was awful. I‚Äôd sob in the bath after each pregnancy announcement, despite being beyond happy for my friends. My partner and I are nearing 40 now and we love having lots of little people in our lives that we can enjoy spending time with - and then give back!!","Damn. The way most people would react to me/treated me during & around my periods before I went onto the 3-month cycle of contraceptives, I always was under the impression that my severe instability and hyperarousal (refering to emotional state, not horniness lmao) was me being ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù, at least until I looked into it myself and realize that everyone else was just being an asshole because clearly if you‚Äôre the only one *obviously* going mental because of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hormone fluctuations, you must be a hypochrondriac or attention whore, right?

I‚Äôm glad your aunt got relief from her PMS-triggered psychosis when she went on contraceptives and then finally when she hit menopause. It‚Äôs insane what our bodies do to us. It really is. I agree wholeheartedly that periods suck.

I haven‚Äôt decided yet if I want to try to have kids. I do know that if I do, I‚Äôll definitely go on a more potent form of contraceptive than the pill I am currently on after one or two and that will be the end of it. I sometimes wonder of I‚Äôm even fertile, though. I have a feeling conceiving may prove difficult if I decided to try.

I‚Äôm sorry that you are unable to have children, but I‚Äôm also glad that at this point it‚Äôs also no longer an problem to you!","That sounds fucking awful for you. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with that - but I‚Äôm really glad you had a doctor that listened and now you (only) have to suffer that 4 times a year. It‚Äôs still too much, but better than nothing. 

My aunt had PMS psychosis (not sure of the correct term) and it nearly destroyed her life. It wasn‚Äôt the sensation or smell like for you, her PMS literally made her insane. The kindest, sweetest person you could imagine would morph into a monster - she‚Äôd literally plot people‚Äôs murder over the smallest slight. It was terrifying. They put her on the copper IUD + mini pill while she was still menstruating and it help a lot. Menopause is the only thing that‚Äôs completely removed the psychotic thoughts/behaviours though. 

I‚Äôve been on contraception for almost as long as I‚Äôve been menstruating (very late puberty) and I sometimes wonder how different my body would feel without BC. But not for too long. Periods suck. I can‚Äôt have children, and although it‚Äôs taken a while, I‚Äôm now happy not to have them (I‚Äôm nearing 40) so why should I have to put up with painful, inconvenient, costly periods when they can safely be stopped?!","My GYN actually agreed to switch me to a 3-month cycle about 5 or so years back after discussing it with her. My quality of life goes to shit whenever I have a period, so reducing it to 4 times a year was a massive boon to me. Don‚Äôt need to worry about the sensations of menstruating and feeling or smelling my own menses making me feel psychotic and angry or deal with severe PMS, heavy bleeding or cramping anymore since even the 4x a year are usually so light as to not even care now.

If your doctor is reasonable and there‚Äôs no barriers to getting treatment (such as health insurance approval) to worry about, your doctor will give you what you need to improve the quality of your life. If they refuse without a valid explanation, get a new doctor. There‚Äôs no real biological need to have a period once a month - or at all, really - if you aren‚Äôt trying to get pregnant.

It‚Äôs been 6 years since I had a period or spotting and it‚Äôs been a joy!

48,"NO! Tearing during first inter course isn‚Äôt normal at all. Thats the whole reason were bring up how this concept of breaking the hymen is harmful. Thanks for proving my point. 

There is absolutely no reason for there to be any tearing pain or bleeding during first inter course. No more than any other time someone has sex.

Lol your saying virginity is stupid while defending the concept that has been used to uphold and create and validate  the concept of Virginity for thousands of years through virginity checks and the concept that the first time a woman has sex it is different than other times and results in pain or bleeding. Because ther is a physical change that takes place and makes it so there‚Äôs no pain or bleeding in the future and this change is observable and proof of lost virginity. It‚Äôs all bullshit.

That could have been the story of every one of my friends too instead of a bloody horror story if they had known that what they went through wasn‚Äôt necessary, wasn‚Äôt related to anatomy or their hymen, and shouldn‚Äôt be fucking normal. 

It shouldn‚Äôt be normal or expected for women to have pain and bleeding the first time they have sex. That‚Äôs fucking barbaric. Like sorry no one told you and you had to go through that but it doesn‚Äôt mean generations more of women and girls do. Idk why you would want to perpetuate the idea that it‚Äôs normal just so you can feel ok about your first time at the expense of every other girls coming after you. Like I‚Äôm truly sorry to you that you had to go through that and didn‚Äôt have a partner who said oh if it hurts then I want to stop and let‚Äôs make you more comfortable or aroused. Sorry you didn‚Äôt get to enjoy your first time without pain. 

You are bending over backwards to try to explain why it‚Äôs ok for women to have their first time be painful and bloody. None of that matter when it‚Äôs a completely addressable issue. And you‚Äôre arguing against providing women the information they need to know to address it just bc ur vagina randomly bleeds sometimes like Jesus get so perspective. So what. None of the shit you said changes the fact that women bleeding and experiencing pain the first time they have sex can be solved by just slowing down and helping the girl get more comfortable. Which is also great bc if she‚Äôs physically uncomfortable like that she‚Äôs probably mentally u comfortable to. And will enjoy herself way more of she‚Äôs able to relax. Sorry I want women to enjoy their first time. 

But just because you had to go through something shitty trying to normalize it so that other people have to go through it too is a really fucked up thing to do. You‚Äôre literally saying that I‚Äôm shaming you by saying that women shouldn‚Äôt experience pain and bleeding the first time they have sex. This has nothing to do about anything but your own selfishness and needing to justify your own experience even if it means hurting other people. Ok got it.","It‚Äôs completely normal. A lot of people don‚Äôt really know their bodies at that point and don‚Äôt really know how important foreplay is so they just go for it without making sure there‚Äôs proper lubrication and so on. It‚Äôs not ideal, but it‚Äôs certainly *normal.* 

In a perfect world we‚Äôd have people be super careful and prepared every time we have sex, but that‚Äôs not a thing that exists, lol. It‚Äôs completely normal to tear. I think you need to look up the word ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Hell, I‚Äôm 34 and sometimes I jump into a quickie too fast before I‚Äôm fully prepared and even I‚Äôll tear. It‚Äôs normal and I‚Äôm fine with it, lol. Inexperienced people get just as impatient as experienced people do sometimes, and *that‚Äôs completely normal.* You‚Äôre sort of living in a delusional world where you seem to think sex should exist within a utopian vacuum where everything is always prepared and perfect and innately knowledgeable and that‚Äôs simply not practical. 

Is it avoidable? Yes, sure. Are people always actually going to do what they need to avoid it? No. Losing my virginity personally didn‚Äôt hurt at all because I was suuuuuper ‚Äúready‚Äù for it, but since then there have been times sex does hurt because like I said, quickies or whatever.

I totally agree it shouldn‚Äôt be normalized and it‚Äôs barbaric that there are still cultures where a girl/woman has to prove she‚Äôs a virgin by bleeding on the sheets on her wedding night, but that‚Äôs not even what I‚Äôm talking about here. Just in general it happens, and (I cannot stress this enough) *it‚Äôs normal.* Just as *it‚Äôs normal* to NOT bleed or tear the first time. People need to stop seeing this in black and white.

And your little edit at the end to ‚Äúgirls‚Äù is way overarching. Sometimes I get random bleeding from my uterus after particularly rambunctious sex and that‚Äôs normal for some women, at least according to every gynecologist I‚Äôve ever spoken to. Some of us do that when we get jostled. Stuff happens. As I stated, sex doesn‚Äôt exist in some utopian vacuum.

Any ‚Äúthis is how sex SHOULD be‚Äù statement is going to shame someone and it‚Äôs just as harmful language as the idea that women should bleed and tear losing their virginity if they‚Äôre actually virgins.","NO! Tearing during first inter course isn‚Äôt normal at all. Thats the whole reason were bring up how this concept of breaking the hymen is harmful. Thanks for proving my point. 

There is absolutely no reason for there to be any tearing pain or bleeding during first inter course. No more than any other time someone has sex. It takes time, communication, emotional and physical comfort, and arousal and ther will be no pain (unless the person is an anomaly and has a condition that causes pain during sex). 

If there is pain during a persons first time then they have not taken the time to establish the above factors so the woman is not READY. She needs more lubrication and her muscles to relax more. 

The first time I had sex it hurt a little when we tried and I said that and my partner stopped and went back to fingering me until there was no pain when we went for it. It is completely unnecessary  and honestly barbaric for it to be normalized that a woman has tissue damage causing pain and bleeding the first time she has sex when neither are normal or necessary in any way.","Nope, it also qualifies a metaphor. And either way, to tear is to break. And it‚Äôs a thing that can happen, but generally isn‚Äôt a big deal. Often happens long before any first intercourse, and virginity is a stupid social construct.",Lol that wasn‚Äôt a metaphor. Look up the definition. That was a provided example   There‚Äôs a difference,"Uhhhhh, I‚Äôm not. Most of the people in this comment thread agree tearing is a form of breaking and it‚Äôs just semantics. I am not supporting any hymen myths, lol. OP is arguing the wrong point.

You can create significant tears in a human, though most people will just stretch. The Chinese fan comment was what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúmetaphor‚Äù if you‚Äôd like to google what that is.","We‚Äôre talking about hymens did not an antique Chinese fan. Why are people so dead set on insisting that Mia bullshit myth about hymens

Like I said in another comment. Tearing or ripping the hymen would be equivalent to the kinds of tears caused but putting in and out a dry tampon when you don‚Äôt actually have your period. Superficial tears caused by friction that are so small you can hardly see and can‚Äôt feel them. When you take out a tampon that‚Äôs still dry and it hurts a little do you say oh no I broke my vagina! No.","Eh, if I tear, say, an antique Chinese fan, I‚Äôve definitely broken it."
50,I removed my prior comment to add that I went and measured some brooms circumference at work (yes brooms... I had some free time...). Apparently the thickest brooms were at a circumference of 2.5 inches (just shy of 7cm).,Have you.... Seen a broom?

53,"I narrowed it down to American because that's where I'm from and still live, so I didn't want to do that American thing where I just assume my experience is universal, but it sucks that this is a problem in so many places.","I wouldn't say it's just American societies. The world in general just does not take women seriously, especially when it comes to major decisions like their health or careers.

I recently got a bisap surgery, courtesy of the childfree sub, but it's chilling to see stories upon stories of women from all walks of life be denied sterilization depending on whether they have children or not, or because of the probability of regret. Even in a progressive state, with great insurance that covered 100%, I had to still doctor shop because the default attitude is still homemaker/mother for women.","I think it says a lot about American society that people actually ever get it inserted a second time.

Eta: to clarify, I mean that setting individuals up to do one traumatizing thing or another (IUD insertion vs unwanted pregnancy) belies a huge problem in our culture where we don't take women and people with uterine reproductive systems seriously enough to provide a system that isn't just a series of traumatic experiences.","Hard agree. They really should be offering actual pain relief for women outside of the standard tyenol/advil. 

I was so traumatized by my IUD that when I finally switched doctors for a surgery needed, she offered to do my yearly exam and removal when I was under because of how stressed out and anxious I was. IUDs are a common source of medical trauma for people.","Well, an iud is much thinner than were talking about here, but also doctors need to stop doing that. Every person who's had one inserted that I've heard of described it as horrible and it's all because medicine doesn't take women's pain seriously.

The position people use to get it in can vary. I prefer sitting on the toilet and sorta reaching into the bowl. Another common one is standing with one leg propped up at a 90 degree angle (ie one foot on the edge of a tub, chair, toilet, etc).

95,Thank you for that I need to subscribe to her. I always forget to,"You are very welcome! The ""Momma Doctor Jones"" YouTube channel is packed full of important and useful information regarding us females. She is an OBGYN, and she goes over everything from periods and birth control, to the different ways of having babies. And then there's her running ""reaction"" videos of the TV show ""I didn't know I was Pregnant"" which is so stinking hilarious!",Thank you so very much.,"If you're in the US, the Thinx brand is really good. If you're in Canada, I'm pretty certain they ship there as well. I haven't had to worry about that stuff in about 10 years, so I personally never tried them as they weren't prevalent on the market yet. That being said, I have a friend, and my eldest daughter that uses them. My friend is on the heavier side of things, and she LOVES them, at night especially. She doesn't leak past the front or back of the over night pads anymore, because they couldn't ""reach perfectly"" to both front and back. My 16 yr old daughter uses them mostly after she is home from school and on weekends and overnights. She prefers them to pads on her underwear, even the ""ultra thin"" ones. We have discovered she has a sensitivity to something in multiple brands of pads, and is flat out allergic to the scented ones. (I accidently bought them one month, and she said she would try them. That ended BADLY.) Her skin in that area is a lot happier as well. 

There is another option you can do as well. I know for sure they're made on Etsy. It resembles a pair of regular panties, or the Thinx, but it has removable, reusable inserts that vary is size based on flow I believe. I saw them also on ""Momma Doctor Jones"" video talking about what the different things are for menstrual cycles. When it's full, and it's time to change it, if you're out and about, you can carry a roll of baggies, like people have for if their dog poops, and use one of those for the liner. When you get home, you rinse in cold water, and put into laundry to wash it. (I learned the doggy bag trick when I was doing cloth diapers.)

110,"Just a few things

1. Turkey has a VERY low english fluency rate, at about 16%, saying they all speak good english is a massive exaggeration, and is probably limited to the main large cities. 

2. I didn't say bad english = bad sex ed, but that it can be correlated to worse or more conservative education, such as highly religious countries or ethnostates where they choose to limit the teaching of the female body and foreign languages. My point was that these places with lower english fluency rates on average have very limited knowledge or teaching on female anatomy as well, as such, very bad english is commonly hand in hand with very bad knowledge of the female body. Of course there are also groups in the US that weren't taught that either, but that is usually, once again, in the more conservative states. 

3. The US is a mixing pot, as such we don't have any official languages, it's just that English is the most commonly known and spoken, therefore it is taught and learned as a first language, but it is still very common for other languages, like Spanish and German, to be learned and taught as well, since we have a large hispanic population and many German cities that grew from early settlers.","I know quite a lot of Turks, and they all speak pretty good English.

111,Exactly.,"Just some small off topic pedantry, the US doesn't have an official language. But I agree with your comment, it's odd that people would assume non english equals bad sex ed, seeing as there are non english speaking, developed countries with better sex education than the US. A quick google seems to say the Netherlands have the best sex education (kind of hard to measure something like that but it seems to be the consensus), and none of the next few runners up on any of the sources I clicked through were english speaking.","I know quite a lot of Turks, and they all speak pretty good English.

115,">I don't get it, why won't they do some housekeeping?

Cowardice and apathy is why. To the average lefty, someone else pumping a toddler full of drugs doesn't affect their lives, so they don't care enough to do or say anything about it. And those that *do* speak out are exiled from the ideological tribe.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Bret Weinstein were originally LibCenters, who by speaking out against the left-wing extremists, were exiled from the tribe. The right-wing then promptly offered them a welcoming home, where ideological disagreements are plentiful, but rarely rising to the level of resulting in excommunication.

If the left doesn't want to be associated with these child abusing monsters, then they need to accept their exile collectively and move to greener pastures, like what Dave Rubin did.","I don't get it, why won't they do some housekeeping?

Is there any scientific data to support this assumption?","Periods are getting earlier and earlier, that's true, but we're talking about teenagers, and one would assume high schoolers, as that's where the most the popular media focuses on underage/teen pregnancies.

Humans absolutely had shorter lifespans, and until not that long ago. You can't simultaneously say that malnutrition/low calorie diets, poor hygiene, poor medicine (a lot of the reasons you said are redundant or irrelevant, so I'm adding some), etc are relevant to age of puberty and birth rate, but not to longevity. There wasn't a proliferation of seniors until very, very recently in human history. The fossil record shows 30 year olds from a thousand years ago with the kind of illness indicators and deterioration you'd expect to see in someone twice that age today.

It's also interesting that you can go to parts of the world where young girls get married off as teenagers and start bearing children as soon as they are able, and see that those children have outcomes more dependent on social/environmental factors than biological. The kid who's mother is can't afford to feed him appropriately is not going to do as well as the kid who's mother can provide excess calories.","Your comment is just factually incorrect.

If you assert that fascism is socialist because the ""government"" owned the economy, then by the same logic, feudalism and monarchism are both ""socialism"" too.

And as for that actually study, yeah that looks pretty solid, but a few points I should mention

12% were noted as persisters, that is not ""so low that effectively there are no trans children.""

And the study itself gives a lot of extra details about that number.


> In Steensma et al. (51), the DSM-IV-TR criteria were used. Of the 23 persisters, 21 (91.3%) met the criteria for GID; in contrast, only 22 (39.3%) of the 56 desisters were threshold for the diagnosis, suggesting an even more substantial difference in the threshold-subthreshold distinction than was found in Wallien and Cohen-Kettenis


So when a stricter criteria is used so that less kids are considered ""sub threshold"" then that number goes up dramatically.

This references studies that were done before the diagnosis of gender dysphoria even existed. 

At the time, they used gender identity disorder, which wasn't just a different name for the same disorder, it had notably more relaxed diagnostic criteria. It was considered a behavioral disorder, which could be met simply through gender nonconformity. In fact, these studies and their findings are referenced as guiding factors for the diagnostic criteria change that came with introducing gender dysphoria in the DSM-V.

Additionally, even with that more relaxed criteria, many children still did not meet the criteria. 30%-40% of kids (depending on the study) did not meet criteria for a diagnosis. Meaning there was nothing to persist from in the first place. Yet they were included in these ""desistance"" rates. 

Another limitation is the timeframe of these diagnoses, because they'd be done once at an average age of 7 then again after puberty. 

That is not relevant to modern medical diagnosis. Kids are evaluated up to tanner stage 2 of puberty and only then if they've exhibited persistent gender dysphoria are they even eligible for any kind of medical intervention. 

So even if some portion do genuinely desist, the implication that it's puberty that causes it rather than them desisting prior to puberty is pure conjecture. 

> Leuprolide acetate is a common puberty blocker which is used to chemically castrate people

While they're taking it... There are precisely 0 people who've been made permanently infertile solely through the use of sex hormone blockers. The effect is active only when on the medication.

You do realize that you can get pleasure without PIV sex, yeah? But engaging in that specific type of sex risks a child. You consented to that risk. You accept the consequences. And murdering that child because you *chose* to accept that risk and then changed your mind is unacceptable.

>amount of coercion, financial instability before or during a pregnancy, failed contraceptives, medical problems or big life events like global warming and war

Legs open or legs closed.  Dick in the pants or out.  Both parties can consent or not consent, and the simple solutions are: a) don't do PIV or b) don't have sex at all. Murdering a child because you failed to prepare financially is not acceptable. Failed contraceptives are a risk of the contract, murder is not an acceptable alternative.

And those special exceptions aren't limited to rape.  I merely used that in the framing of *consensual* in my previous comment. War is a good reason. Can't support a baby if you're being attacked. Medical complications that may kill the mother is also a good reason.

And you're really gonna call ""climate change"" a good reason for murder?

>There's no contract between living developed humans and barely developed clusters of skin cells.

Yes there is. You consented to the risk, you must deal with the consequences. You could have easily *not* accepted the risk by doing options A or B above. Actions have consequences and murder is not justified unless your life is in danger, just like self defense. Hence the special exceptions listed above.

>every doctor around them refuses to treat their life threatening medical conditions

But every doctor isn't refusing. Hypothetical: what if *every* doctor refused on conscience? Would you coerce them? You do not have a right to abortions. Just as healthcare is not a right. *Nothing* that relies on the labor of another is a right.

You have a right to *seek* healthcare, including abortions. And to be painfully clear and unambiguous: **I support a woman's right to choose**. I will *never* support weaponizing the govt against people for what drugs they do or don't want to take, what guns they want to own, who they want to associate with, etc.

*But* I will always advocate for life. I will always try to find a solution that doesn't involve murdering that child.","> Did a man and a woman willfully and consensually

> it means you are accepting the risk of a pregnancy

Which is to travel as far as needed to get abortions. That's what rich people who don't give a fuck will do in states where abortion is banned when they don't want an unexpected fetus weighing down their kids futures.

> You've entered into a contract

No you haven't. Nobody ever has or ever will. There's no contract between living developed humans and barely developed clusters of skin cells. Even if there was, it would be nullified in any court just like someone trying to farm your kidney because you signed a piece of paper.

> And murder is not an acceptable solution just because you suddenly changed your mind.

It is if it's a parasite. Even actual monkeys know parasites are undesirable.

You get your asscrack split by someone pulling the cheeks apart, you get your tits slapped and your nipples pinched. You maybe get some exaggerated slobbering near your vulva.

Took a few more years to realise that cis people also usually feel gender as an innate feeling inside them, and that *not feeling like you have a gender* is an innately trans experience.

Some people are disgusting. That doesn‚Äôt lower their worth. But some people are just physically unattractive. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say on the matter.","I don't think grandmas are sexy, but they definitely don't look disgusting. Also saying that people look like shit is literally the definition of bodyshaming","I don‚Äôt hate myself. And I‚Äôm not bodyshaming. Looking like shit is a part of aging.

While genetics play a big factor, so does gravity. 

In cultures where women do not wear bras, they have very relaxed breasts from an early age. 

They all look like shit eventually. But the rate at which they do depends upon your genetics and your maintenance.

189,"I see. That does make sense then. I guess I could have googled that. Haha. 
Now I know what it is. Thanks!",Well according to google (I am no doctor!) a bunion occurs when the bone in your big toe moves out of place. So it would make sense for ballet dancers and strippers who wore heels for hours. One of the causes mentioned for bunions are shoes that are too narrow so pointed heels and ballerina slippers would make sense.,"That‚Äôs what my foot does!! I was told that is a bunion. I said ‚Äúno, my foot is misshapen now‚Äù but the person said, ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs what a bunion is.‚Äù
Is that what a bunion is?? I just figured they knew more than me.","Oh yeah! One of my friends was a ballerina and she now has weird feet. Her big toe goes inwards, mimicking the shape of ballet slippers.","I‚Äôm going to have to look into that. 
I was a stripper for about 5 years. So 8 to 10 hours of wearing heels ever night while dancing. My feet had a distinctly different shape after. It has lessened since I haven‚Äôt danced/worn heels in so long. I also thought people who do toe point ballet will have foot shape change.","I have flat feet, so maybe? They‚Äôre not longer, just wider. But the bunion on my right foot doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore!

Another myth, OP, is that high heels cause bunions. Nope, just genetics.",Wait‚Ä¶ is that a thing?,Same. But my feet! I‚Äôve gone shoeless for the pandemic (as well as braless) and my feet are definitely bigger now.
190,Well my friend was 25 when she showed me and she had not been a ballerina in a few years. So pretty early I guess!,"Yeah, basically a bunion is when the bone of the big toe starts sliding out. My mom‚Äôs toe is at like a 45 degree angle. Maybe more. She never wore heels!

Ballerina feet are messed up. They wind up with misshapen bones on the top of the foot. Like the foot arches *all* the way. Presumably that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre dancing while they‚Äôre still growing.

ETA: I‚Äôm reading that lax connective tissues is the problem, and that‚Äôs genetic. But that flexibility is great for ballerinas. So I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they have terrible bunions.

192,"If you do go with an IUD, go with a different provider. You want someone who takes your pain and concerns seriously, and who will take the time to discuss the pros and cons of different pain management options for it. Full sedation isn‚Äôt really doable for an in-office procedure but it‚Äôs definitely not Pap smear level pain, either.",Yes that response really turned me off from deciding on it. I know people personally who've said how bad it was and they are mother's so I trust their pain threshold. I know it could go relatively well but I also know it could not and her acting like she knew a.) My pain threshold and b.) That I wouldn't have any complications really annoyed me. I've just been researching uid personal experiences but I guess I should be looking into more options as well.,No. It is not relative to a pap smear. That's a sketchy thing to say.,"These are very interesting responses. I'm also at the point with my husband where we are discussing a vasectomy, we live in America, but just like I'm nervous he obviously is too. Fun times, I will for sure ask about non hormonal birth control. I asked pretty thoroughly about the pain and she told me it was close to a pap smear and I'd be fine, which I know is not the case.",If doctor is not offering you significant pain management tell doctor to get fucked. And I'm saying that as someone who has best case scenario experiences with an IUD.,Not OP but my Dr is telling me I need to get off birth control due to my age in a few years and is pushing an IUD since I don't ever want kids. I'm such a baby I make my husband tell me jokes to get my COVID vaccine. Last time someone tried to take my blood I actually scared them into giving up...,"Also if reading articels of people getting an iud inserted is already giving you anxiety, maybe it is just not the right thing for you. There are other hormonal methods avaliable, with pain free applicating, like nuva ring, birth control pill, etc. Or is there a specific reason only an iud is an option for you?","I have a copper iud (not an hormonal iud) but I think the insertion process is basically the same. My insertion was definitly painful (like a really bad period cramp), but the strong pain is really quickly over. Not even a minute, as I remember it. For the rest of the day I had light to medium cramps similar to the start of my period, so i recommend not planning to do anything for the rest the day of the insertion.

For me personally that amount of pain is totally worth it for 5 years of very save but hormone-free contraception. But notice that I am not generally anxious about painfull medical procedures. I don't enjoy them for sure, but I don't feel fear or anxiety before it, so maybe this does not apply to you. Also I have had bad period pain for years, so I am kinda used to this kind of pain."

WAP and Ben Shapiro aren‚Äôt German in origin, so that‚Äôs why I asked.","Watching/discussing recent pop culture topics helps develop familiarity with the language. I watched Finding Nemo in high school Spanish class for this reason. And in college we watched the Shakira and Alejandro Sanz video, La Tortura, to compare how their accents differ due to being from different countries, and how they pronounce similar words slightly differently. Allegedly, anyway. I can't say how many members of the class were actually doing that versus just enjoying the view.",My question remains,Just happened in my German class,How is any of this German-related?,"Hahahah welp just got that kind of teacher igggg

Although if I'd gone past my due date again my doctor would have advised a planned c-section. As it happened, my daughter came 10 days early and so fast that she was born in triage. Unmedicated, because there wasn't time to give me anything. 

After cooing over the amazing newborn baby on my chest for a moment, I turned to my husband and said, ""let's not do that again."" (Already the plan.)

I heard that rubbing is very essential.
I'm not good with english names, but it was in area of clitoris? Labia Minora?

They should really come with like, u-bend handle grips or something.

Edit: omg. I googled it and the u-bend handle dildo actually exists.","I own a dildo but it is not something I use regularly. I‚Äôm in a long distance relationship and the only time it gets broken out is when I‚Äôm so turned on that that‚Äôs the next natural step and I feel like I‚Äôm craving it, which is only like every 3 months.

Stay strong both of you ‚ù§,"Thank you, sounds like you have a very understanding and loving partner, all the best to you.

My wife is battling cancer currently, that‚Äôs a rough road. Hope that is all well with you.","You hit the nail on the head! You need a prize. I haven't had kids and can't cause they took my uterus last year but after 4 yrs of nonstop bleeding till they took my uterus and other issues sex is very painful 98% of the time for me. But my boyfriend doesn't mind and we both wait and enjoy sex once enjoyable for both of us. Hell this man could have left me 10x over in the last 3 yrs but our true love and chemisty for one another wins over everything; my cancer, my small Fiber neuropathy, my rheumatoid arthritis, and being out if work for 2.5 yrs for a still undiagnosed issue.","You bring up a good point for parents. One your not supposed to have sex until iirc 6 weeks after birth, and even then you have a baby in the house that doesn‚Äôt adhere to a normal schedule, you‚Äôre tired, weak, brain fogged and that goes for dad too. After my wife and I‚Äôs 3rd and last child she was after sex before I was even thinking about it. And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúare you sure, it‚Äôs barely 6 weeks, I don‚Äôt want to cause problems or discomfort, I can wait, I‚Äôm tired too‚Äù. But she was ready and wanting, we took it slow and before long we had a new routine. 

As to the main context of this post, my wife has had 3 kids all natural (no c-section) and while there were some differences we have never had ‚Äúbad‚Äù sex. I think what people miss in discussing this topic is if you are just there for some action you‚Äôll be disappointed with the most perfect one, but when you genuinely love that person, sex is always good because there is an energy and chemistry that doesn‚Äôt care about small changes and differences.","Yup, definitely that too.

It's significantly more likely for women to experience not just changed sensation, but major difficulty with sex after childbirth.

263,"But if it's a problem with or affecting a *dick,* they'll fall all over themselves trying to fix it. Even insurance is in on that. Need some viagra or a penis pump? Insurance will cover it.

Need a hysterectomy because a medical condition causes you horrific pain? But what if your future husband wants biological children?! You should wait for him, so he can decide.

...sorry. The way women are treated in the medical system overall is enraging enough but I also had a horrible time with my pelvic floor disorder. I saw **9** different male urologists before my pelvic floor disorder was diagnosed (my pelvic muscles were clenched up 25/7, which made it feel like I *always* had a UTI). It took a female urologist less than 5 minutes to diagnose me. I went through so many tests- urine tests, blood tests, multiple types of scans, even one where they stuck a tube with a camera up my urethra (it's supposed to be easy and short but as a sexual assault victim, it wasn't for me. They couldn't knock me out all the way so I had to work with my primary to find something that would sedate me just enough to get through it without making me unconscious. It still took me months to work up to it. The doctor acted like I was hugely inconveniencing him, which didn't help. Normally I would've dropped a doctor acting like that but I was desperate and didn't want to start all over with someone new. 

I did my own poking around after my diagnosis and I was so shocked to find out just how common pelvic floor disorders are, yet are talked about or even diagnosed. So if *doctors* aren't going to start the conversations on it, women will have to (like we do with so many other things).","Exactly!! Why aren‚Äôt our doctors telling us these things, and helping to mitigate them?! It‚Äôs not like the research isn‚Äôt out there.

It prevents/treats a *lot* of the complications women regularly experience.

Just a couple quotes from it:

>experts argue the benefits are profound, reducing women‚Äôs immediate pain levels, helping to combat urinary and fecal incontinence and even making intercourse pleasurable again. It is also a long-term investment in public health.

276,"> you mean as opposed to ""its a medical condition""?

No. This is a good example of what I mean by things being misunderstood.

Go back twenty years and while there was often a medical component to transition, how most people conceptualized their identity was different. The notion of ‚Äútrans‚Äù *as a lifelong identity* was not common. The term ‚Äútrans‚Äù hardly existed, we mostly had TG and TS.

It was much more common for people to frame their identity around the gender they were transitioning to, and to see ‚Äútransness‚Äù as a liminal state. It was a place you went through to go where you wanted to go.  Your identity was not constructed around a medical state and in fact we actively worked at the time to move away from terminology that was medicalized. 

The modern idea of ‚Äútransmedicalism‚Äù has almost nothing to do with how things were twenty or thirty years ago. It‚Äôs more of a modern invention.","> The number of people who‚Äôve recently come out as trans is overwhelming compared with how many there were before, and there just aren‚Äôt the same numbers of ‚Äúold timers‚Äù around. 

thats just a natural consequence of people not living in fear or ashamed though, no? i saw your other comments in this thread and what you went through as a kid doesnt sound amazing, i can see why a lot of people would simply stay in the closet or kill themselves if they can neither stay in the closet nor come out.

>it‚Äôs that the current framing of things like the concept of ‚Äútrans‚Äù-as-identity is incredibly recent

you mean as opposed to ""its a medical condition""? i suppose i see what you mean if that is what you meant, it is a little odd to build an identity around what is essentially a glorified birth defect or a form of intersex condition (seems reasonable to call it that given how theres sex differences in the brain for trans people), its a bit like gay men and women who once they come out make everything about being gay and it becomes the centre piece of their personality. but that phenomenon is also not really limited to trans people? theres black people that act exactly the same way around their skin, people with mental illnesses doing this too, some groups of women in general as well. everyone wants to feel special i suppose, and no one wants to feel as less than.

but ultimately such behaviour doesnt cause anyone harm nor invalidate whether these people are actually trans, so i'm not entirely sure why its necessary for people to know that transgender-ism(?)/transsexuality was once seen differently? is how its seen now a problem? i agree that how the world treats transgender issues is very different from 1980s but is it a problem?","I think this issue is much larger in the T community than in LGB.  The number of people who‚Äôve recently come out as trans is overwhelming compared with how many there were before, and there just aren‚Äôt the same numbers of ‚Äúold timers‚Äù around. 

It‚Äôs not so much mistakes that I want people to learn from, it‚Äôs that the current framing of things like the concept of ‚Äútrans‚Äù-as-identity is incredibly recent. There‚Äôs been a drastic sea change in the last ten years, more change than in decades before then.",">  I was an activist and I think I have a lot to offer, but some recent transitioners seem to shy away from any idea that things used to be different and that historical perspectives are valuable.

i think this is more of a generational thing tbh, i'm not trans but i know a few people that are close to me that are and obv a bunch of non trans people as well, all of us collectively put zero value on history. a couple are history nerds and it interests them in general but none use historical actions to guide us today. we plain dont give a shit what happened, if an issue exists today it makes no difference why it exists, it needs fixing regardless, the *why* may be interesting but in reality has zero value. its either a problem or it isnt

a history teacher i knew once loved to spout history is important to learn from so we domt repeat mistakes, yeah well, only real impact on the world i can see is china using nazi genocide of minorities as a fucking guidebook on how to genocide people better today without attracting attention. they sure learned - theyre using history as a lesson on how to create a more successful holocaust.","I think that‚Äôs true.

I do find it difficult to get many of them to hear my perspectives. I was an activist and I think I have a lot to offer, but some recent transitioners seem to shy away from any idea that things used to be different and that historical perspectives are valuable.

I don‚Äôt get as warm of a reception on trans forums when I talk about history as I did here.","I think the lack of historical perspective isn't willful ignorance, just ignorance.

297,"Ooh, they offered me ibuprofen and Tylenol afterward for the pain. Soooooo useful üôÑ my doctor really was a very nice lady, but I'm sure the clinic doesn't ""allow"" anything that would make it not excruciatingly painful, for my iud and this biopsy at least. I also was not expecting a biopsy, so we went from ""she might want a pelvic exam"" to ""we're performing this horrifyingly painful procedure in 5 minutes, is that okay?""

Doctors can be amazing, but the clinics they work in are utter shit for caring about patient comfort.","I don‚Äôt know why more doctors don‚Äôt offer a prophylactic anti-anxiety because tensing up can make it hurt worse.

Oh wait. Yes I do.","I didn't know at that time that I had vaginismus, only that sex was difficult/painful. I got the IUD because I was afraid I wouldn't take the pills on time, so it saved me that little worry, but it ended up causing more problems anyway. My ex said he could feel the string, I was in pain for days with major cramping, and over the year my period cramps got worse and worse every month, I only got the copper one without hormones. I'd never really had much cramping before, but each month it was more painful, until I finally had it removed, which was WAY freaking easier and I barely felt it at all. I switched to condoms, I wasn't having much sex anyway.

Yeah, it fucking sucks it's all on women, and all options have their own dangers and complications and can cause serious problems for some very unlucky women. Just the IUD had some major potential injuries, like perforation, which is horrifying to think about.

I've had 4 kidney stones, but the IUD and the biopsy were far more painful than any of the stones I've had, and they were bad enough I could barely walk and kept feeling like I was going to throw up. At the time, I decided I was never ever getting one again, and I never will.

I warned my doc about my problems with the speculum and that an iud nearly made me faint, and she did try really hard to be as gentle as possible and took things slow, we waited a few minutes after getting the swab thing through my cervix because I was near screaming just at that. But I said we'd try since we were that far, and after a few minutes she tried the biopsy, but my fucking God it was unbearable.

I looked around online a bunch after mine and it seems it's at least painful for most women, and excruciating for some. Then there's the ones who were like ""lol it just tickled a little bit why are you so upset?"" because my body is different than yours and processes pain differently than yours, duh? üôÑ Unbelievable that doctors still lie and say it ""might be uncomfortable"", and force women to endure it was nothing for pain (and topical lidocaine is utter shit, it does nothing for me at all).","Girl. I have vaginismus and I won‚Äôt touch an IUD with a 20 foot pole. I don‚Äôt know if you did it because hormonal birth control is worse, but it‚Äôs so dumb that 95% of the burden is on us. We have to feel the pain. We have to endure the side effects, the pregnancies, the abortions, the miscarriages. Then there‚Äôs the emotional burden on top of all that. Ugh.","I damn near blacked out getting an IUD. Darkness creeping in from the sides of my vision, sounds going dull, etc. It was excruciating. I recently needed a biopsy from the inside of my uterus and they couldn't finish because I started screaming ""no no no! Stop!"" I have vaginismus so just getting a (small!) speculum set up was painful in itself. They put topical lidocaine on my cervix and it didn't do shit. Those few seconds left my eyes watering and my entire body shivering from pain. I told her I am never doing that again without a sedative. Luckily results were good so I didn't need to do it again, but fucking hell it was beyond painful in those few seconds, *worse* than the kidney stones I've had which themselves are extremely painful.

They need to toss this ""uncomfortable"" bullshit and tell it like it is.","I'm glad she takes it seriously and advocates for her patients but why can't gynos call IUD insertion what it is. They always say it's ""uncomfortable"" or ""you're gonna feel a lot of pressure."" 

Kinda wish they would validate our pain more. It's indescribably brutal.","This! The doctor should‚Äôve 100% asked him to step out to talk to her alone. At the very least the doctor should‚Äôve explained to him why he was wrong and why these are NORMAL things for a women‚Äôs body. I have thick hair and if I shaved every single day I would have cuts, rashes, and in grown hairs. Not to mention, anything inside the vagina that isn‚Äôt normal to it can cause infections especially if she‚Äôs prone to them. I‚Äôm prone to infections and can get them if I use the wrong type condoms or if I let someone finish in me. 
The last time I went to get an IUD in my ex boyfriend came with me. He kept making jokes the whole time and while she was putting it in, and my gynecologist looked him in the eyes and said, ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt take stuff like this seriously than you shouldn‚Äôt be having sex. She is getting this very uncomfortable procedure done for you. You should be holding her hand and comforting her rather than making jokes.‚Äù",The doctor shouldn't have treated it as a joke and should have pulled her aside to see if she needed help escaping a possibly dangerous situation.

She said her loved ones would irritate her so much that she would literally be thinking violent thoughts & how to get away with it. His response: ""You just need to control your temper.""

313,In my personal experience where i live it's mostly products of religion. Idk about other societies though.,"Toxic masculinity is just fucked all the way around. For men it's the opposite: Not having had a sexual partner before is shameful. This idea is so enforced that when I had my first sexual encounter I felt the need to lie, saying that it wasn't my first time. It was only later on in my life that I realized most women don't even care. It's just another product of our messed up culture.   

Being shamed for one's past sexuality is hurtful and I don't even understand how it started. Why are we so mean to each other?","I would gladly accept being called a slut on the first sexual experience with someone just because I've had a previous partner, that's a great warning to make me leave early on rather than sticking around and finding out about their shitty views of me later.","From the uneducated and/or misogynistic views I've heard the difference between a virgin and a slut is often as little as one or two past partners.

If so then it would make sense that a woman who has lots of experience with sex would have more confidence and therefor be more relaxed then a woman who has little experience.

not necessarily, and definitely not to the point of it ceasing to be pleasurable. a woman who has never had sex and is extremely in her head about it can experience vaginismus (extreme tightening of the vagina to the point of penetration being near impossible), but other than that, a vagina will not be looser its 100th go than its 10th.","There may be a bit of truth to the myth for entirely different reasons. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the tightness/ looseness of the vaginal walls connected to arousal and relaxation levels?

324,Fellow [redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/hat780/all_bodies_are_not_beautiful/fv6sqeq?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) destroyed all my hopes and dreams by explaining that calcium can build up (calcification) in your veins and arteries and give you the big cronch,"Veins can what now.

Longer version is below.

So guys have two holes basically- the anus and then the urethra at the tip of the penis.  Well, girls have three- from front to back, it's the urethra, the vagina, and the anus.  The urethra, like in guys, connects to the bladder, but the vagina is basically the tube/canal/whatever that connects to the uterus (where babies grow).  The vagina is also where the period blood comes out (it's basically some blood and some lining from the uterus).

There are some guys who don't know this, so I really want to emphasize: **you can not ""hold"" your period the way you can kind of hold it when you have to pee.**  It is basically biologically impossible- the vaginal hole is bigger than the urethral hole, and the muscles don't clench together enough to completely close off the hole (and it's not like there's a sphincter muscle like there is above your butt hole that can help you not mess your pants).  That's why girls need either pads to collect the blood or tampons to catch/absorb the blood before it leaves the vagina.

Longer version is below.

So guys have two holes basically- the anus and then the urethra at the tip of the penis.  Well, girls have three- from front to back, it's the urethra, the vagina, and the anus.  The urethra, like in guys, connects to the bladder, but the vagina is basically the tube/canal/whatever that connects to the uterus (where babies grow).  The vagina is also where the period blood comes out (it's basically some blood and some lining from the uterus).

There are some guys who don't know this, so I really want to emphasize: **you can not ""hold"" your period the way you can kind of hold it when you have to pee.**  It is basically biologically impossible- the vaginal hole is bigger than the urethral hole, and the muscles don't clench together enough to completely close off the hole (and it's not like there's a sphincter muscle like there is above your butt hole that can help you not mess your pants).  That's why girls need either pads to collect the blood or tampons to catch/absorb the blood before it leaves the vagina.

ETA (6/22/20): I made a mistake in my post in saying the vagina is a muscle; it's not actually a muscle apparently, it's just tissue that's surrounded/supported by muscles (which influence how ""tight"" or ""loose"" the vagina is at any give time.  Thank you  u/redesckey for letting me know.

344,"I‚Äôve never really had this issue. I just dry it off with tp, and it‚Äôs about as damp as everything else down there.",Because a wet tampon string gets your underwear wet.,"But why does that matter? You are gonna wash your hands anyways after changing your tampon and touching the pee-string (and generally after every visit to the toilet). If it's for the cleanness of your underwear, well.. unless you are completely shaved, your public hair already does a mighty fine job of transfering residual pee onto you panties. But then again, I've been using a cup for quite awhile, so I lost all squeamishness regarding bodily fluids. ;)",Not to mention... peeing on the string sometimes. :(,"As a woman, it's worth pointing out that some girls (myself included) will *say* they can't pee with a tampon in.

They technically can.

What they mean is that, while urinating, their pelvic floor muscles start to push the tampon out of the vagina.","yeah they can- the tl;dr version is girls don't pee out of the same hole where the tampon goes in.  Longer version is below.

So guys have two holes basically- the anus and then the urethra at the tip of the penis.  Well, girls have three- from front to back, it's the urethra, the vagina, and the anus.  The urethra, like in guys, connects to the bladder, but the vagina is basically the tube/canal/whatever that connects to the uterus (where babies grow).  The vagina is also where the period blood comes out (it's basically some blood and some lining from the uterus).

There are some guys who don't know this, so I really want to emphasize: **you can not ""hold"" your period the way you can kind of hold it when you have to pee.**  It is basically biologically impossible- the vaginal hole is bigger than the urethral hole, and the muscles don't clench together enough to completely close off the hole (and it's not like there's a sphincter muscle like there is above your butt hole that can help you not mess your pants).  That's why girls need either pads to collect the blood or tampons to catch/absorb the blood before it leaves the vagina.

369,"Lmao, ‚ÄúI get shadow banned for no reason‚Äù. Sure, dude bro. Yeah, I‚Äôm so sheltered. I‚Äôm sheltered even though I don‚Äôt have a family and I do everything by myself.

Generally I wouldn't explain or defend my stance on this, but I will for once;

My first ever boyfriend. I was 15 and amazed that someone actually paid positive attention to me, so I was enamored. He lied about his age, said he was 16 when he was actually 23. The first time we were ever intimate, he sexually assaulted me. It completely changed me as a person and I will forever miss the person I used to be. I already came from a home that was immensely abusive, but what he did was just the final straw in terms of being broken down as a person. It put me into a spiral of bad decisions and bad choices in men.

It took me several years of working on my own, as I was underage and my parents didn't believe me, to find some modicum of ""normality.""

Then I met my second-ever boyfriend, who was emotionally manipulative and a horrible person overall. He had an extremely high libido but 0 idea about women, other than ""dick go in and feel good,"" (I had to explain to him what the clitoris is), and constantly pushed me for sex, made me feel bad for not wanting it, despite him knowing what I had been through. Every sexual encounter with him was like reliving that nightmare over again.  So when I got the courage, I dumped him and stayed more or less single for nearly 9 years, beyond a couple other attempts with some pretty clueless guys. I changed myself for the better, found hobbies, found my real family, I went through a whole hell of a lot of therapy and self-growth. 

And then I met my current partner. He listened, he didn't push, he eased me into things. He was actually overly cautious, and went above and beyond to make sure I trusted him with my body, that I was ready, that I was okay the *entire* time. 

I am not making a blanket statement or generalization of saying ""men are inept,"" but that the men I was with were inept, selfish, or terrible people.",Hmm,"I'm not blaming it on anyone beyond my partners who were incredibly selfish, inept lovers lol","Christ, it took me until just last year to actually have a proper orgasm thanks to anxiety and inept, selfish partners, and I'm bloody nearly 30.

386,"+1 for the write up, well said","> women are these evil beings without actual feelings.

I think this is a misunderstanding. In a _vast_ majority of cases where men hold these views, women are not really seen as ""evil"".

---

Firstly: most women are ""good women"". That is, most women are women who either actively conform to their ideals or, much more often, women who simply do not speak up in ways they perceive. A ""good woman"" doesn't have to actively conform to those ideals, so long as she doesn't do anything to speak up, attempt to stop, or attempt to change a man's behaviour should he hold those ideals. A store manager who actively looks the other way when a floor manager gropes female cashiers is a ""good woman"", but so is a cashier who simply quietly takes it and doesn't say anything in a way that affects the assailant negatively. 

---

Secondly: most ""bad women"" are not evil, but are instead ""corrupted"". There's a huge theme that goes around misogynistic circles: **degeneracy.** Degeneracy is the idea that the ""natural moral structure"" of the world *(in which women are subordinate to men amongst other things)* is being corrupted and disrupted, leading to women acting in ""unnatural"" or ""inappropriate"" ways. 

People who subscribe to the degeneracy concept nearly-invariably believe that idealised womanhood is one of the young girl who exists in a childlike state of nonsexual innocence until she becomes sexually mature. This maturation is also often idealised, with it often portrayed as occurring somewhere between the age of 13 and 15 wherein, after a short (typically one yearish) growing period, the child is suddenly and immediately a woman, though of course she is still required to be a na√Øve young ingenue who is both physically beautiful but unaware of sexuality or sex, while also being immediately sexually available to ""men"". These young women are immediately the idealised ""good woman"", who is subordinate to men and will immediately marry and have sex with the first ""good man"" (note: all men are good men in this story ""except bad men"", which tells you so, so very much...) and be a ""good wife"" etc. 

Failing **literally any** stages of this fantasy is ""degeneracy"". 

The problem, though, is that it's not called ""degeneracy"" for no reason. It's believed that failing at _one_ of these points causes moral weakness in young girls and young women, which makes further ""degeneration"" more likely. Women who are open about sexuality, or display personal sexual confidence or knowledge, or who dress in ways that suggests they both understand and wish to enjoy - or, worse yet, _control_ - sex are seen as conclusive evidence that one slip-up leads to a slippery slope of degeneration that turns women into Miley Cyrus or Brittany Spears, both of whom have been labelled as ""degenerate"" many, many times. These women are seen as a kind of moral toxin, corrupting ""good women"" into ""bad women. They're not exactly **evil**, so much as they're... almost like a disease? They're kinda treated like you'd treat someone carrying a plague who refused to quarantine: not evil so much as polluted. 

---

Thirdly: feminists are not _""really""_ women. Feminists are the ultimate end of degeneracy: they're a final and in a sense terminal corruption of women away from the fairytale ""ideal"" and towards that kind of... morally polluted mess. Feminists aren't evil women so much as just kinda... evil. They're often intentionally desexualised, with the goal in mind of removing the ""woman"" label from them entirely. For example, I can name at least 5 far right-wingers off the top of my head who have said on Twitter, at least once, that ""[they] wouldn't even rape her [any given feminist, often Anita Sarkeesian]"". The goal of this is to **dewomanise** them, to remove their sexual value from people's minds. Since their version of a woman is inherently sexual (either a ""good woman"" or a ""bad woman"", depending), by saying ""I wouldn't forcibly violate her under pretence of sex"" they are trying to remove that person from the category of ""woman"", good _or_ bad. 

**Feminists aren't seen as evil women.** They're seen as a kind of moral disease that infects society, because **they're not seen as being really women at all.** 

This is also why you see SO MUCH TRANSPHOBIA directed at them, trying to ""smear"" famous feminists as ""secretly men"" and labelling them as transgender. The goal is to make them _not women at all_, but just another example of ""degeneracy"": they want to turn them into a poison rather than a person. Trans people are seen as so bad because trans people fuck up their nice tidy view of what (not who, what) a woman is and introduces the idea of women as more than sex objects and reproductive units. Trans people force society to have a conversation about not just _what_ a woman is, but ***who*** she is as a _person..._ and these people aren't willing to have that conversation. Instead, trans women's existence serves as another way to try to strip womanhood from those who are seen as too ""degenerated"" to be ""fixed"".",I really hope you‚Äôre wrong but probably not based on some things I‚Äôve heard from some men. It‚Äôs frightening how entrenched they are that women are these evil beings without actual feelings.,"> eah he‚Äôs going to paint himself as te victim

389,I think your definition is technically correct. The best kind of correct.,"Meh, I consider anyway into or out of a person an orifice, may be my definition is too lax.","I'm afraid you're slightly mistaken. The [nasolacrimal ducts](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d7/32/f7/d732f7b2bb027f988bc4364d32bad976.png) drain into the nasal vestibule, that's why your nose runs when you cry.

That said, this is why I said I could see an argument. But if you're going to accept the lacrimal puncta as orifices then you open up other possibilities like mammilary ducts (not to mention the lacrimal ducts draining tears from the lacrimal gland *into* your eyes) and we go off on an academic tangent that is no longer tethered to the common understanding of the word ""orifice.""",Eye ducts certainly are. The lacrimal ducts drain your tears back in to your sinus.,"I don't think that eyes are generally considered to be orifices. Tear ducts I could see an argument, but it's a bit of a stretch (although I do remember seeing a Ripley's believe-it-or-not video of a man who could force corn kernels up his nose and out his tear ducts).","Well don‚Äôt we typically have seven above the neck even without the tear ducts?

392,"My first PIV experience was with my now husband, but we were both religious and grappled with the guilt so much that after marriage we still struggled for a few years (married 12 years now and everything is happy and fine, and he's a wonderful human!) but I've learned that being raised uber religious is an entire different experience than what the non-religious people went through. I could absolutely be wrong (again, I always want my biases checked), but I think people raised non-religious have an advantage we didn't have. There's no weird guilt around a lot of things that shouldn't cause guilt. My life was basically dictated by guilt, and even though I've been out of religion 10+ years, guilt over stupid shit is still something I fight.

Again, biases on my part, but I think you're lucky for not being raised religious.","That is pretty, crazy to think of, I was born into a very non religious family but, then again I don't really know anyone from denmark who is, sounds crazy to have those moral dilemmas as a teenage girl, who has the pressure of years of religious teaching and the pressure of someone you love, sounds awful
:c","No no no, that doesn't mean you're not a clever person! Guys have absolutely used the ""loophole"" narrative to pressure girls into anal when they won't budge on the no PIV sex until after marriage!

It's just that some girls come to that conclusion themselves too because when you're a sexually mature teen in relationships that, without your religious convictions, would otherwise turn sexual, it's really hard to abstain from sexual acts altogether, but the guilt of sex-before-marriage is also too hard of a burden to bear! So it's easier to just pretend there's a ""loophole.""

Anal loopholes are a great example of human complexity in ways that are hard to describe if you haven't been in a situation to rely on it or be manipulated into it.","Ahhhh, makes a lot of sense, I just assume it was something guys said to girls who refused anal, im not a clever person.","How do I explain it? It's kind of a double think thing. Everyone knows it's ridiculous (at least in the back of their minds), but being a healthy horny teen will make you do mental gymnastics. The term [""anal loophole""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ZF_R_j0OY&t=134s) itself is a joke among Catholic kids mostly, but also in super Christian teen circles (I was raised Southern Baptist). But the joke is rooted in something that actually happens. Basically we were taught that ""real"" sex is penis in vagina (PIV) sex. So, really horny teen girls will eventually give in to oral and anal sex (even though Biblically this would probably fall under sodomy depending on your translation). We ""knew"" it was still a sin, but any excuse to express our sexuality and yet claim it was okay was really a necessity. So girls wouldn't have PIV sex, but would instead have anal sex so they could try to justify how they weren't perpetrating the sin of sex before marriage rule.

400,Tbh that always confuses me a little even though I have a vague awareness of its existence and where it is,"So the vulva is generally used to refer to the outer part of female genitals. It includes the labia (there are inner and outer labia-outer labia is well, on the outside of the urethra, clit, and inner labia, inner labia is outside the vagina). The urethra is the tiny hole you pee out of, between the clitoris and the vagina. The clitoris is a little button-y thing near the front end of the outer labia, and has a bunch of nerve endings that give a lot of usually pleasurable sensation. The vagina is the, well, the vagina. The hole for penetrative sex and babies. The cervix is up inside the vagina and more or less separates the vagina and the uterus. It‚Äôs a weird round thing that stays mostly closed most of the time, except when giving birth. It can be super sensitive and has a kind of weird texture. Also inside the vagina is another part of the clitoris, which is generally what people mean when they talk about the g-spot.","Well I know the term vagina and its meaning and purpose, then there's vulva,labia,cervix urethra and I just get too lost.",What don‚Äôt you understand?,I honestly still dont understand that nor has it clicked with me but(im male) at least im not vocal like some.,basically. like i know i was told i had something called a vagina in 5th grade but it never clicked bc i just never knew there was another hole. i was just really confused,So Schr√∂dinger's vagina?,i didn't even know i had a vagina until 8th grade. literally didn't know that hole was there. it never surprises me the extent to which we dont teach young women and girls about their own freaking bodies
401,"You're welcome, I hope this helps!",Thank you for educating me.,"\-Vulva is the external female genitals.  Labia is part of that, there is the labia majora and the labia minora which is inside the larger one.  The labia majora is the shape that you see when a woman has 'camel toe'. Labium are like folds of skin, and between them is the other stuff.  Labia look very different depending on the woman but their variation has nothing to do with # of sexual partners, it's just genetics.  

\-From front to back is the clit (which is NOT a hole), the urethra (very small hole where urine comes from), and then vagina (size changes depending on factors like arousal.  It's a muscle so it can tighten u know?).  

\-Cervix you will probably never see.  It is the part deep inside the vagina at the opening of the womb, and most people find it very painful if it is touched by anything, so don't believe porn where ladies orgasm from a huge penis hitting their cervix... that's just not what happens, for the vast majority of women.

402,"Are there different goals that are more realistic you could choose that could lead to more happiness?

I went back to school when I was 35 after spending 15 years in a job I hated.  Originally I wanted a doctorate in psychology.  I didn't get in to the program I interviewed with, and I spent several months depressed as fuck because that was my goal, that's what I wanted, and it felt like shit to even think about changing my goal.  But it got to be the time of year when I needed to get my grad school applications in if I wanted to be considered for the next year.   I did some thinking about what exactly it was that I really wanted to do.  Long term, my goal was to be a therapist in private practice.  I wanted to get there by getting a doctorate because I also wanted to do research, and because I love psychology and I wanted deeper knowledge.  So, I thought about how important each of those goals actually was to me, were there any I could let go of and still be satisfied, and what alternative paths could I take for the ones that are non-negotiable.  I decided doing research wasn't really a huge priority for me.  It would have been interesting, but it isn't what I want to do.  Getting a deeper knowledge of psychology isn't something that requires getting into a doctoral program.  I can do that on my own.  So that left becoming a therapist, and I could do a master of social work program that would take me far less time and be a lot less stressful, and I wouldn't have to move like I would have if I'd done a doctoral program.

So, I applied to MSW programs.  I got into one, and I graduate in May.  I'll be a licensed independent therapist probably when I'm about 45-ish (you have to accrue a bunch of hours under supervision before you can get a license and practice independently).  Sometimes I'm a little sad that my career as a therapist is going to be shorter than it would have been if I'd gone back to school earlier, but then I think about the alternative--staying in this awful career.  

My student debt is pretty gnarly, but meh.  I'm in the same boat as a lot of people, and if my choices are ""shitty career where I'm miserable"" and ""career I love but I'll be paying off loans for the rest of my life,"" the second one sucks in some ways, but it is better.  And it isn't necessarily true that I will be paying off those debts for the rest of my life.  There are programs that I will qualify for to pay them off (I live in an underserved area, so I can apply for this program to pay off my debts), so that gives me some hope.  

Anyway, my point in all this is to say, when I was depressed about my age and really ruminating on that, it wasn't doing anything to improve the situation.

403,Just wait until you learn of one of the named disciples (maybe apostle... Not too sure) was originally a woman but was name changed to be a man's name.,After reading this story I remember the conversation had in it but not the ailment she had. Why though? :/ Yet another female erasure thing I never realized I was being taught in church.,"It‚Äôs [Luke 8:40-48, Mark 5:25-34, and Matthew 9:20-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_healing_the_bleeding_woman?wprov=sfla1) -- Jesus is on his way to Jairus's house to heal his daughter (who he will soon raise from the dead). A woman who had ""been subject to bleeding"" for the past twelve years is in the crowd following him and touches his cloak. She's immediately healed and Jesus is like ""wait who touched me tf"" and then she confesses that she wanted to touch his cloak in hopes of being healed, and he says that her faith has healed her.

The actual text is pretty vague about the precise nature of her bleeding problem (since, after all, it's not really the point of the story). Apparently some scholars do view it as menorrhagia. In Jewish law, menstruation makes you unclean for the duration of a period, so a woman suffering from constant menstruation would suffer a lot of social and religious isolation as a result.",Which story was this? I don't remember it.,"There's even a story in the Bible that says periods are normal, though technically Jesus heals someone from having a chronic period in the process so...","I don't get how people see periods as ""dirty.""

‚ÄúWhat do you mean there‚Äôs no dinner? You‚Äôre ALL unclean?‚Äù","Some other woman or girl.  These are *old* superstitions.  Daughters would help around the house almost since the age they could steadily walk while boys would begin training in ""manly"" work.  Unmarried women would contribute to the households of their families (which household was determined by the culture) and women worked until they died.

On top of that, marriage meant (and still means) different things depending on the culture.  In some places, a man may have had several wives.  These were not sexual marriages, though.  This was about created a secure economic unit which, I might add, has been true for most forms of marriage throughout history.

So there was almost always another woman around to help out.  Also, the whole women are unclean bit is almost entirely limited to the Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc) and the places where they held the most sway.  In most other places, it didn't matter and some even considered bleeding to be a positive thing because they recognized its connection to procreation.","I was always curious about how this worked though: if a woman who normally kept the house clean and prepared the meals was out for a week ""dirty"", who did the work?","Yea I know a lot of older people who have no idea about this stuff.

I knew this sub would be helpful.,"PIV is short for penis-in-vagina intercourse. Many people think that‚Äôs what sex is but it‚Äôs so much more than that. Every sexual outing doesn‚Äôt need to end with PIV, for one. There are plenty of other ways to pleasure partners and ourselves and get off. Exploring those makes for much richer and varied sexual experiences.

I didn‚Äôt see this myself until I started having gay sex. The dynamic is different when there‚Äôs two penises. Same with lesbian sex. There‚Äôs no script, no preconceived idea of how sex should end like with straight sex. Gay/lesbian sex has fewer assumptions about what roles people will play and that alone opens the door to exploration (and negotiation).

434,"I wish I had said something to the nurse, but I have a problem with over politeness so I just smiled and hid my embarrassment, then tried to laugh it off, and only realized how deeply it cut me much later.

My boobs were the same during puberty and you can‚Äôt even tell now. I wouldn‚Äôt spend much time or energy stressing about them if I were you.

With my first pregnancy, I remained mark free until the last month, and then I cried, but those faded really quickly. I was wearing a two piece the very next summer (fall baby). My stretchmarks from Baby 2 are just so big it‚Äôs warped the shape of the skin which is hard to get over. The color is fading but I can‚Äôt say it really looks better. It would probably help if I lost some of the extra weight from being so sedentary during my difficult second pregnancy, but between breastfeeding, hubby being deployed, and the pandemic, I haven‚Äôt had a lot of free time, childcare options, or gym access. But slowly, I‚Äôm getting there.

The hardest part has been mentally reconciling the way I see myself in my head aka pre-baby body, and what I see in the mirror now. I may not even look that bad to other people, but the contrast between the two images is startling to me and makes my ‚Äúflaws‚Äù more obvious to me. We are all our own worst critic.

I‚Äôm so glad your fianc√© is so supportive. It makes a world of difference to have a partner like that. Someone to embrace you and encourage you to embrace yourself as is, without nitpicking.

Thanks for commiserating with me.","I am sooo self conscious about the ones on my breasts, like literally both of them are just 100% stretch marks at this point. I'm only 33wks along to so I guess there's still time to get marks on my stomach. The one's on my butt/hips are so faint I have to point them out for people to see them, so they don't bug me anymore. They did when they were visible, thankfully time did right by me with those.

I can't believe that nurse said that to you, that's so messed up and unprofessional. I would probably just completely break down sobbing if that were me. 

I get not being able to be comfortable in your post-partum body, I'm not there yet, but I'm not even comfortable in my pregnant body with all the weight gain so I'm sure I'll continue to have issues after as well. 

I'm glade your husband is so good to you. My fiance keeps telling me he's excited for how I'm going to look post partum, apparently mom bods are his thing so maybe that will help me.","I have very easily stretch-marked skin. I went from being an athletic skinny kid to a very curvy teen during puberty and I got lots of stretch marks. They faded and didn‚Äôt affect me much in the long term. 

As I expected, I also got stretch marks during my pregnancies. The first wasn‚Äôt so bad. I even wore a bikini after and was barely self conscious. My second pregnancy was much more difficult, and the baby wasn‚Äôt positioned correctly, so he sat really far forward and stretched my stomach painfully. Right after he was born, there was a young male nurse came in to check my abdomen to make sure everything was doing what it was supposed to and when he saw my stomach he said, ‚Äúwhat happened...? These are ALL STRETCHMARKS??!?!‚Äù It really hurt to hear something like that from someone who has seen a lot of post-partum tummies, and it really stuck with me. I know a lot of women are like ‚Äúyou earned your tiger stripes! Flaunt them!‚Äù But I just can‚Äôt yet. Fortunately, my husband is amazing and has almost convinced me that he still finds me attractive and doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm damaged.

443,I agree that it is dehumanizing and should examine our reactions so that we can change our implicit views. I do think though that it is a gross overexageration to say that anyone who has been influenced into feeling this way without examining it thinks that a woman is worthless unless a virgin or wants to fuck their daughter,"Society conditions their individual views. And their way of thinking is still dehumanizing to women and shows that on some level (that they may not even be aware of) they don‚Äôt view women as a human being with full autonomy the same way they do themselves. This way of thinking of virginity in women originates from women being treated as property in the past, and their virginity something that ‚Äúbelongs‚Äù to their father, and later, husband. We like to think we‚Äôve outgrown patriarchal ideas, but we really haven‚Äôt, we just rationalize them differently or don‚Äôt examine our reactions too closely, as you said.",I think this is a little bit of an accusatory view. I dont think that these views necessarily come from individual views but societies view that women are worth less when they have sex compared to men who are worth more. It's completely normal to hold a view opposite to what you have been programmed to feel. A father then may feel more defensive about a daughter than a son having sex without necessarily believing the daughters worth comes from her virginity or wanting to fuck her. I'm not saying there are not fathers out there (such as OPs) who do want control over their daughters sexuality but I just dont feel like it is always the case. I believe a lot of the time they dont know why they feel that way.,"I have always said it's just so inherently creepy when the men of a family take so much interest in the ""sexual purity"" of the women in the family.

They can rationalize it however they want, but it seems like they (a) only see women as objects whose only inherent value is their virginity or (b) really, really want to fuck their female family member themselves.

Especially since these same men don't seem to put any value or taboo on their male family members' virginity.  They see nothing wrong with the guys fucking, but the women are absolutely forbidden.","It will forever boggle my mind how much time some men spend thinking about their kids' genitals.

477,"Aye, most folks where I live now are quite shocked when I tell them how awful it was in my school. I think most schools do have decent sex ed but a lot of religious and rural schools just never caught up with the times. and because people generally seems to think that we've good sex ed and because the areas where it is lacking are religious and rural, nothing was ever really done about it.","Honestly,  I'm pretty shocked by this. I was expecting you to say 45+. I'm from the Midlands and we had videos demonstrating the changes your body would go through, how to apply a condom correctly, information on STD/STIs, how pregnancy worked, the complete anatomy of your sexual organs. Think pretty much the works really.","Im 22, from rural Scotland.  My girlfriend that I mentioned in the comment is now 21 and my sister is 18.

So quite recently.

I know some schools have good sex ed and the sex ed I received from the Biology/chemistry teacher was absolutely stellar, but like I said she only did that in response to our abysmal sex ed and was fired for it.","How old are you if you don't mind me asking? I'm not that far off 30, so mine was approaching 20 years ago and was pretty good.","When I say the official sex ed I received was abstinence only, I mean it was literally abstinence only.

We didn't learn about anatomy, we didn't learn about contraceptives, we were banned from saying 'penis' or 'vagina' in the class (seriously), there was no discussion on LGBT issues (which was probably good considering how religious our guidance teacher was), there was some talk about STIs but we never learned what they were, or how to prevent them and it was very much ""If you have sex you will get pregnant and ruin your life"". My mum didn't opt me out and my gf from England wasn't opted out either. She was simply failed by the system.

So parents keeping their kids out of sex ed is only part of the problem. We need a consistent, comprehensive and enforced sex education. Apparently the UK finally has that now from September last year, but we'll see how comprehensive it is and if it actually is enforced. The Tories have a habit of introducing progressive laws and then never or barely having them enforced. The UK's FGM laws are a big example of that.","We did had an opt out policy at our school but the only ones who did were the handful of Muslim kids, who sadly are also still totally ruled by their religion. One of them was totally disowned by his family for coming out as gay, luckily a very popular guy who had a lot of support from the school and community though.","Sex education in the UK is not mandatory sadly, or if it is, it is not at all enforced.

My biology teacher upon learning that none of my classmates received *any* sex ed in primary school and that sex ed in our secondary school was abstinence only decided to teach us in her free topic and she ended up getting fired.

My girlfriend who grew up in England had the same experience, except she didn't have an awesome biology teacher who was willing to put her neck out for the kids. She grew up not knowing what a period was until she had her first one and effectively got no sex ed from her school. When we started dating her only sex ed was porn.

My sister went to a different primary school, also received no sex ed there and received very little sex ed when she entered secondary. My sister and I were lucky that my mum was willing to talk with us.

Parents can also opt their kids out of sex ed for any reason which of course defeats the whole purpose.",Is it not?! Here in the UK we have our first sex ed when we‚Äôre like 10 and then all throughout our teens.

Apparently the UK finally has that now from September last year, but we'll see how comprehensive it is and if it actually is enforced. The Tories have a habit of introducing progressive laws and then never or barely having them enforced. The UK's FGM laws are a big example of that.","We did had an opt out policy at our school but the only ones who did were the handful of Muslim kids, who sadly are also still totally ruled by their religion. One of them was totally disowned by his family for coming out as gay, luckily a very popular guy who had a lot of support from the school and community though.","Sex education in the UK is not mandatory sadly, or if it is, it is not at all enforced.

My biology teacher upon learning that none of my classmates received *any* sex ed in primary school and that sex ed in our secondary school was abstinence only decided to teach us in her free topic and she ended up getting fired.

My girlfriend who grew up in England had the same experience, except she didn't have an awesome biology teacher who was willing to put her neck out for the kids. She grew up not knowing what a period was until she had her first one and effectively got no sex ed from her school. When we started dating her only sex ed was porn.

My sister went to a different primary school, also received no sex ed there and received very little sex ed when she entered secondary. My sister and I were lucky that my mum was willing to talk with us.

Parents can also opt their kids out of sex ed for any reason which of course defeats the whole purpose.",Is it not?! Here in the UK we have our first sex ed when we‚Äôre like 10 and then all throughout our teens.,"Non religious, biological Sex Ed needs to be mandatory everywhere. Like, I love reading shit like this for a laugh but it‚Äôs actually so concerning how many people, both men and women, don‚Äôt understand human bodies. It‚Äôs worse when they‚Äôre adults though.

But any location where hygiene is so bad that circumcision is beneficial are also the very last places you want somebody coming at baby genitals with a knife.

Honestly, it's all just bullshit to defend an entrenched cultural practice because the alternative is admitting we've been advocating for the mutilation of infant genitalia for no good reason.  It's deeply fucking *weird* from any objective standpoint if there's no super-strong scientific support for it, and ""mild health benefits"" is not it.","I don't really understand what hygiene benefits are there after the invention of the soap.

488,"Okay, great! That's how your brain sees it and that's cool! Brilliant! All I'm saying is, a lot of parents don't see it that way. And like I said, I'm not saying it's right, I'm saying that's how it is for parents. Most parents don't understand how smart their kids are, they don't understand that when they ask ""why?"" A million times in a day, ""just because"" or ""because I said so"" aren't satisfying answers but they don't understand that their kids can understand so much more than that. It goes quicker as well, if you give them an actual reason like ""you can't get in the bath right now because it's too hot, you'll burn yourself and it will be really, really sore."" People aren't taught to parent that way, we're taught that kids don't understand logic and reason, because they're too small and too new. When really, they understand it very well. A lot more than ""just because"".","I don‚Äôt see it like that. I see my child‚Äôs intelligence and ability to learn. I see his curiosity, his inquisitiveness, his desire to learn more. What‚Äôs more childlike than asking a million questions? And what is a source of bigger pride for a parent than seeing their kid learning and understanding new things? When my son uses the right words, I think I‚Äôve done my job right.","It's not just another part of the body though, not to parents. It's their kids private parts, their bits and pieces, the parts that they're supposed to hide, that they're not supposed to see. I'm not saying it's right, I'm saying that's how they feel. I completely agree you, kids should know the proper, medical terms for their own protection. But parents don't want to see their babies using such grown up words. They're babies, they want them to stay babies forever and when they use grown up words like penis or vagina it reminds them that they won't stay babies forever and that they are growing up.",Why does the word penis or the word vagina make someone uncomfortable? It‚Äôs like being uncomfortable with the word femur. It‚Äôs simply the medical term for part of the body. What would happen if we started giving random nicknames to other body parts? A chin can now be called a potato. Since we‚Äôre apparently uncomfortable with the real names of things.,"I'm agreeing with you. It's absolutely necessary that they know the proper words and they do grow to learn the proper words. I grew up with ""flower"" and ""winkie"" but I still know where and what a vulva and penis are. I still prefer different words though as that's what I'm comfortable with. All I'm saying is, people don't like the idea of their babies running around calling their bits and pieces their ""vagina"" or their ""penis"" because it makes them uncomfortable, it looks out of place, wrong.","Children are going to grow up and need the correct words for things. My 3 year old is perfectly capable of saying penis and vagina. It is horrifying to think if something happened to a child and they wanted to tell someone they  trust, if they told someone ‚Äúmy flower hurts‚Äù or ‚Äúmy uncle played with my flower and it made me sad‚Äù, they wouldn‚Äôt know it was serious. This is really not hard. You teach children the correct words and stop acting like they‚Äôre bad words or to hard to say or whatever. It‚Äôs a cop out.","I understand why you dislike the nicknames but some people are just more comfortable using words closer to the language of their children. In my family, it's always been wee bits have winkies and wee girls have flowers. But I understand it can make it difficult for childcare professionals to understand where/what the problem is when they don't know that the words their using means penis or vagina.",I absolutely despise nicknames for anatomy.

My point was that sometimes it doesn't matter if you wipe the correct way, you need to clean more thoroughly than wiping does.","I think what you‚Äôre missing is that the urethra is often protected by the vulva - the labia - and so by wiping back to front, you can introduce shit and bacteria into the urethra by pushing it up there with the wiping motion, where it would not otherwise have managed to go.

That's a terrifying condition to deal with and I hope she is doing better now. Thanks for sharing her story, very relevant and important.","This happened to a woman I worked with who went to a chiropractor regularly. To be fair, she also had a bad habit of cracking her own neck constantly, though.  Because she was so young, the doctors didn't realize what was going on when she went to the hospital presenting classic symptoms of a clot, so they sent her home. Later that night she had a stroke and barely got to the hospital in time to keep her alive.","Not how it works. Aggressive chiropractic cervical (neck) manipulation can result in artery dissection (tearing) which causes blood to leak out of the artery resulting in clot formation. This clot can then become embolic either at the point of manipulation or later after it dislodges and circulates in the bloodstream.   

From the Cleveland Clinic:    

> Cervical artery dissection begins as a tear in one layer of the artery wall. Blood leaks through this tear and spreads between the layers of the wall. As the blood collects in the area of the dissection, it forms a clot that limits blood flow through the artery. If the clot is large enough to completely block blood flow, this can result in a stroke. Equally dangerous, pieces of the clot can break off and travel up through the bloodstream, limit the blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke.  


They do note that clots in the neck rarely break off, but may still be symptomatic via pressure on surrounding structures. 


They further note:     

> Cervical artery dissection also can occur in the general population as a result of blunt trauma injury to the neck, such as a high-speed car accident or a fall, with chiropractic manipulation, or from hyperextension of the neck in sports or exercise. Cervical artery dissection has also been reported after heavy weight lifting.

506,"Oh, I'm a demon and fill the tub with straight hot water, then submerge myself. The shower isn't hot enough, because the water cools as it falls.",Ugh I wouldn‚Äôt trust a bath on my period. I don‚Äôt care how crappy I am and how nice the water would feel. I‚Äôd rather just lay down in the empty bathtub and have hot water slowly dripping out of the shower head onto me.,"> I have virtually no labia minora

I'm the same way, but for me, blood/tissue (I'm very clott-y) only comes out in the bath if my flow is heavy. On lighter flow days it doesn't unless I scoop it out. It's amazing how much variation bodies have.","If I get in the bath, blood comes out. 

I guess everyone is different. 

I have virtually no labia minora, and you can see straight to my vagina, so that might be part of it.",">So a girl or woman with a heavy flow would just menstruate into the pool...

That's not what happens. When in the water, pressure and density differences keeps the fluid from leaving the body. The uterus is still doing it's thing though, so as soon as she leaves the pool, she will need to act fast or stain her suit. But it's not going to look like a scene from Jaws. Also, the amount of fluid is very small, so even if it did still flow out, it would not be noticeable in the pool. Very heavy flow is like 2 fluid ounces in a day. Average is about 2 ounces total (4-7 days). I mean, women take baths on their periods all the time, do you think we're just soaking in a literal blood bath? Lol

Edit: come on people. I'm not saying ditch your tampons for swim time. I was just correcting the other comment about bleeding in the pool. Even if your flow doesn't stop in water, you're not hemorrhaging in the pool. Obviously don't wear pads in the pool. Obviously use tampons/cups.","If you went in the water with the pad on and then kept that same, pool water drenched pad on after swimming, it will definitely turn into an infectious, disgusting mess.

But the main issue would be that the pad would suck up pool water immediately and then be ""full"", making it unable to suck up the period blood, effectively making it useless. So a girl or woman with a heavy flow would just menstruate into the pool...","Yeah, wouldn‚Äôt that be, like, a biohazard?",A pad is to pool as tits are to wall. Useless.

519,"Sure do, as does the literal statistician who commented above.",">Do you have a background in research or statistics?

Yeah I read maths and physics in university so I'm statistically and experimentally literate.

Making my ass talk (backed by data) valid.

There is a wide variation in human body shapes but statistically larger body parts are found on larger people.

Penis length is however also correlated with hormone levels during certain periods of development and probably a myriad of other factors as yet unspecified. This means there isn't a very strong correlation with ANY one variable.

As I pointed out, even the correlation between hand length and foot length with height is only technically a ""weak/moderate"" correlation, but again, definitely a correlation and definitively positive.

The complexity of the human body means that even in medical studies, r values greater than 0.4 (rough guideline boundary for a weak correlation) are not seen often without gigantic sample sizes.

Larger body parts are statistically found on larger bodies.

Edit:

This correlation does not at all apply to men with some of the most common forms of dwarfism, where the soft tissues of the body are unaffected but bone growth is impeded in some way. These people have internal and external soft tissues roughly equal in size to those of people almost twice their height.

538,"[According to Cochrane reviews](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007412.pub5/full), evidence for choosing active vs expectant management is mixed and the data is too poor to make specific recommendations for all women. 

‚ÄúThe evidence suggested that, for women at mixed levels of risk of bleeding, it is uncertain whether active management reduces the average risk of maternal severe primary PPH (more than 1000 mL) at time of birth. For incidence of maternal haemoglobin (Hb) less than 9 g/dL following birth, active management of the third stage may reduce the number of women with anaemia after birth. We also found that active management of the third stage may make little or no difference to the number of babies admitted to neonatal units. It is uncertain whether active management of the third stage reduces the number of babies with jaundice requiring treatment. There were no data on our other primary outcomes of very severe PPH at the time of birth (more than 2500 mL), maternal mortality, or neonatal polycythaemia needing treatment.‚Äù","According to the AWHONN active management of the third stage with pitocin and fundal massage is indicated and recommended for all births, regardless of nursing, nipple stimulation, or risk factors.

Massage and pitocin aren‚Äôt necessary, unless medically indicated. :)",When the placenta detached it leaves behind an open wound with exposed blood vessels. The uterus has to contract down to squeeze those blood vessels.

Is the uterus doesn't contract down enough the mother can bleed out and die.,"Thank you. And u/greenSixx.

Sometimes they cut when you're neither stretching nor tearing enough to let the baby out and it becomes a problem, or when it looks like you might tear all the way to your anus (3rd degree tear) they sometimes make a tiny cut a bit to the side so you tear in that direction. But yeah cutting is definitely not ideal and should only ever be a last resort.

Just to prevent people panicking thinking ""OMG but I was cut by my gyno who I love and trust"" when they may have had a good reason. 

It also makes a lot of sense if you consider your skin is made of connected cells. Cutting will go right through the cells. Tearing will go between the cells. Much less traumatic on your skin.

592,This is the kind of stuff that everyone should be learning in schools üôèüèª,"Absolutely! I had a similar experience when I first got my period. All the pamphlets inside tampon boxes act like you‚Äôll die if you leave it in for more than four hours, and my mother echoed the same thing. I was terrified until I realized how rare it is! I like to compare it to Serotonin Syndrome- doctors, pharmacy, and any online info will warn you about taking medications together because of the risk. It‚Äôs pretty damn grim lol. Took me awhile to learn about how rare (and treatable!) it is.

There definitely needs to be better info out there for girls so that they‚Äôre not all scared shitless about dying from an exceptionally rare condition!","I do also want to just point out that TSS using tampons during your period is more of a scare than anything to people using tampons and it's not AS big of a threat as a lot of people feel it is. 

I remember when I first started using them (and that was only when I was 18 as well mind you) my mum told me to change them every 3-4 hours urgently so I felt like if I left them in any longer I would just die. She wouldn't let me sleep with them in either because of that.

I did some more research (Mama Dr Jones is a blessing) and I'm not nearly as worried anymore. Basically if you don't just ""forget"" you're wearing one and leave it in you for days on end you'll be okay. Just change it when you can or when you need to.

So now I can sleep in peace and not be afraid","Oh my gosh! The most I‚Äôll do is put one in when I feel like I‚Äôm going to get my period within the next few hours, although when I‚Äôm ovulating I get so much of that sticky discharge that it feels like I‚Äôm peeing myself whenever I stand up, so I might use light tampons for a day or two. TMI, sorry lol. We‚Äôve all been through it.

And sometimes people think that the only way you‚Äôll get TSS is if you leave a tampon in for too long. That is definitely a cause, but TSS can also come from inserting and taking out dry tampons frequently. Because there‚Äôs no blood to, uh.. lubricate it (I guess?) on the way out, it‚Äôll create tiny scratches on the vaginal walls, and bacteria can enter through those and cause TSS.",I worked with a woman who did this because she was tired of surprise periods bleeding through her underwear.

I was like 8 or 9, so definitely not the age where your period starts, but I had little blood drops in my underwear and since our parents weren't at home I told my brother. He of course was in shock, because remember I was way too young, but he put me aside, explained to me the stuff with periods and that it's normal and yadde yadde yadda.

643,I agree. I showed her this thread tonight and she just nodded like it was absolutely normal.

When I was ten we had driven home from somewhere and mom asked me to stay in the car so she could talk to me.  I‚Äôd know about babies since I was 5 but never really knew about periods. She explained everything to me, gave me a packet of pads, and told me she never wanted me to feel like she did. Because of this I have no memory of my first period, it wasn‚Äôt traumatic or a big deal, it was just whatever.

644,"I honestly don't think he thought much about it. It was just something that mummy did. Like how daddy sometimes goes to play cards with his friends, mummy sometimes has a period.

646,Yes feeling not normal is *really* hard to get over. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre feeling okay now.,"I was born with it due to a medical thing. So there are some women out there like me but women are only born with it if they have the same (rare) medical thing I have. I don't feel ugly anymore like I used to and I've grown to accept it and even like it. But I think it's true for anyone who has any kind of abnormality, feeling not normal is hard to get over. Thank you for your kind words though, it's true I'm beautiful no matter what!","I don‚Äôt know what your abnormality (you absolutely don‚Äôt need to tell us here) but what I learned in life is; if you have it and think you‚Äôre not attractive or weird, there‚Äôs a lot of chances a lot of people have it too and THEY ARE still beautiful and SO ARE YOU. Not because something is rare or unusual that it‚Äôs not attractive to others. We judge ourselves too harshly.","I do have an abnormality with my genital development that's been an issue for me in the past, so I wish there were pictures of vulvas/genitals like mine out there but there really isn't, not like there are for different labias sizes/shapes. I'm not so bothered by that any more though. I had a lot of shame over that as a teenager. I do take nudes for my bf... But generally avoid anything too head on to my vulva cuz I hate seeing it.","You might just have some internalized shame with it. One of the ways I became comfortable with how mine looked was seeing a lot of the porn blogs on Tumblr that were aimed at women and were inclusive of all the different sizes and shapes of labia. I also spent a lot of time learning about what I looked like with a mirror and learning to take good nudes of myself (as long as you're 18) really helped boost my confidence and self love. You might dabble in some of those but really you don't have to check it every day, you just need to know what normal looks like for you.","Am I the only one who is grossed out by looking at themselves? I've done the whole mirror thing, checked myself out, and I always feel so uncomfortable and a little grossed out by it. I don't know if it's cuz of that awesome sex shame I was raised with or what. I don't think vaginas in general are gross, Im bi and I've been with women. But seeing my own so directly feels wrong.

647,"True. I guess what I was trying to say (probably badly) is that Googling for information is fine, but it needs to be paired with critical thinking and not with a biased intent.","But the first links that come up when I search female anatomy aren't mommy blogs. It's WebMd, plannedparenthood, edu sites. All sources that back up their information.",The anti vaxxer rhetoric is indication that a quick Google search is not necessarily the best way to prove you‚Äôre right.,"It's also the easiest way to prove you're right?

And that‚Äôs exactly it!

I'm usually pretty up on my knowledge. I would think if someone didn't have that anatomy and someone told them something about it that they thought was wrong, their first instinct should be to google it to prove their point right? Not just stand there and be like ""no I'm right!"" I had a guy try and tell me that my labia were part of my womb and when I told him that it wasn't even kind of close, he refused to listen even when I pulled up a diagram on google that the uterus is internal and not outside?

Like if someone told me something about dicks and I was like ""that doesn't sound right"" the first thing I'd do is pull out my phone and google it.","It's always so strange to me when people (almost always men)  are so certain of their incorrect knowledge. I'm not that confident about things I'm 100% sure I know!!

It's funny, I am from the US and had amazing sex ed  -- we were never separated by gender and they tested us on contraceptive methods' effectiveness at preventing pregnancy and STIs and made us watch a live birth video in 7th grade, and in 10th grade we practiced putting condoms on pink sparkly dildos. 

I \*know\* that all the boys I grew up with received pretty extensive knowledge about the female reproductive system (and vice versa), and in 5th grade I distinctly remember our teacher making us name all the holes and who had which ones.

660,"Thank you, I appreciate that. A lot of people see monthly bills and fail to recognize that homes have an ‚Äúidle‚Äù consumption. Meaning with your fridge, clocks, and other miscellaneous appliances that have actual power draw and parasitic draw - meaning the house grounds out and consumes electricity even if nothing was plugged in, and that consumes roughly 1 - 1.75 Kw/hrs non stop 24hrs a day 7 days a week. 

When there are no habitats in a unit, some power companies can remotely shut off power at the junction box to reduce the parasitic draw on the grid. 

That idle consumption accounts for a lot of an electric bill for most eco-conscious people. 

I actually found that in my friends house, the home idled at 2.5 kw/hrs. Having never paid attention to this fact their lack of awareness caused a lot of accusations to who‚Äôs actions were causing the excess power bill. They‚Äôve since attributed to the real cause and a lot of stress left the home.

670,"Interesting. 

Now there is more to learn and to read about because my mind isnt capable of finding peace when i have questions. 

If by casuality someone that knows about science, psychology, neurology or anything could come and teach us a few things about this conversation, i would be happy.","Personally, I'm not asexual, but not strictly allosexual either (autistic, demisexual etc.). I used to be somewhat repulsed by genitals despite very open upbringing, no religious or moral baggage, no trauma, good education. Heck, I grew up pagan with the whole feminist mother nature vulva/phallus worship slant. 

Exposure in both the sexual sense and non-sexual (naturist) setting alleviated that, but it's kinda ""Schr√∂dinger's neutral"" - I'm simultaneously indifferent, positive (in a theoretical appreciation way) and repulsed. I'm not sex-repulsed, so that allowed me positive interaction with genitals. A sex-repulsed asexual doesn't have that option, and even my ""training myself"" didn't fully remove the negative undercurrent. The social construct aspect is salvageable, and that would be sufficient for the majority of people, but the brain wiring isn't.","Im not certain about that. I've been working in a naturist camping. People hang out completely naked. Genitals then lose their ""sacred, sexual, hidden, whatever"" character. I strongly believe it is a social construct.

Obviously, when things get hot between persons, sex get sexy, but when having a coffee, it doesnt.

Where does repulsion come from ? Isnt it construction we made (conscient or inconscient) through our education ? I think it is something we learn to be, not native. 

>no amount of education is going to help a sex-repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.

You're probably right. I guess its too late for them, and learning not to be repulsed would be a hard work that i'm not sure they would want to do if they are ok like this. But i was talking before that. When we are children. 

And i'm reaaaally not saying being asexual is a problem that should be cured. I have nothing to say about asexuality (or any form of sexuality or asexuality) as long as people are happy with it. My concern is only about being repulsed by body parts. Concern being a big word here.","But the genitals do have a sexual connotation, no amount of education is going to help a sex-repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.","Well it is just my opinion and i'm not going to force it. 

I feel that any human should know the basic human anatomy, without disgust at all. We should be able to comprehend it without putting in any sexual aspect. But once again it is just my opinion, not backed by any science. But i feel people would be more relax about it if we could just see it as we see arms or ears. No emotions, just plain and cold.

See, im a hetero man, i have no attraction for men, but I can watch a male or female organ with no disgust, and even tell people if there's something wrong like a visible skin disease, and tell them to go get checked.

But it is my way of seeing life. I'm really convinced people should know more about anatomy. We hide everything so much that it becomes like a secret, it gets mystical for some, and creates frustration, bad behaviour and so on, just because. I really feel if we would just treat organs as we do for ears, some problems would be avoided. Not all, obviously, but some.

Once again, only my opinion, not forcing it. I'm curious about yours, if you mind explaining. I wont tell you're wrong or im right, i would just understand other people's opinions better, and that is very good.",Why would it matter if you‚Äôre attracted or repulsed by them if you‚Äôre not going to be near them or dictate what people should do because of what you believe.,"Its ok to be asexual, but I don't find it ok to be repulsed by human body parts. If you remove sex, there still is basic biology, anatomy, plain and cold.",People gotta learn that it‚Äôs okay to be asexual.

690,Oh 100%.,"It's all ridiculous since a broken hymen isn't necessarily indicative of virginity anyway.

691,"Yes, it was the special cocktail of the night.

Actual answer: my now ex husband used a jar to empty the turtle tank and left it half full in the kitchen. I came home thirsty from the Madrid heat and only realised the strange taste after I had drank the whole thing. My ex's aunt was also having a heart transplant at the time so we were both too stressed for common sense.

(Transplant went well, I didn't get salmonella, aunt is fine 13 years later, ex and I divorced but are still best friends and friends with our respective new partners, happy endings all around)",".........sooo which part was accidental?  Drinking the tank water, or drinking it the day before?  Like, was that supposed to be reserved for the main event?","Vagina food is always a terrible idea, but I accidentally drank turtle tank water the day before my wedding so salmonella doesn't scare me.","Well yes, obviously, I was just picturing vagina salmonella",...literally everything in my post...,">stuff chicken livers inside and whatnot

Today on terrible ideas:","Not the culture I know that does virginity checks, because I'm that one they are carried out by women...

Edit to expand: In Spanish Roma culture you can either have a wedding or an ""arrejuntamiento"" (joining). A wedding brings more honor to the bride's family, and it includes the ritual of roses, where a designated elderly woman will stick a white handkerchief in the bride's vagina until the hymen tears a bit so they can show the ""roses"". 

Although the joining is also acceptable for many families,  it's going to depend on how tradicional the patriarch is so there is some trickery about it. It's sometimes possible to bribe the hymen checker so she'll prick her own finger, stuff chicken livers inside and whatnot.

There are also (although thankfully not common) bride kidnappings which is fucked up. Some years ago the family of a kid in the high school where my mom works kidnapped the girl he had a crush on to force her to marry him. It's a very hermetic community so it never transcended if she was raped or not or what consequences were brought upon the kidnappers family; as far as the school staff knows the police were brought only to report the girl missing and once she appeared they were asked to let it drop. Thankfully the girl's family was not traditional so they did not force her to marry the boy.",What culture is it?
692,That's a perfect example.,I could totally see that pervert Warren Jeffs doing something like this. Or any one of his cronies.,"Extremist Christianity might send the fianc√©e to a doctor for a check to make sure her hymen is intact, but I've never heard of any religion saying it's okay for a father-in-law to look at his prospective daughter-in-law's vagina!

In the Middle Ages in Christian Europe, the women of the family might do a check if a prospective bride was accused of unchastity, but that was a Big Deal, and usually only done if a dowry was involved.","I was about to SAY. I know a whole hell of a lot of Muslims (Arabs, not Indian, but still) and almost every muslim man I know would rather be skinned alive than participate in anything like that.

I'm not saying weird virginity checks don't happen in Islam but it's not being done by men.

 >Body hair, or androgenic hair, is the terminal hair that develops on the human body during and after puberty. It is differentiated from the head hair and less visible vellus hair, which is much finer and lighter in color. The growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of androgens (often referred to as male hormones) and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. Both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.

That is, if you're this hairy as a woman, you'd probably get a lot of comments and feel more pressure to remove or cover up the hair.  So if most of the upper end of this curve is just fully removed, then the only 'natural' leg hair you end up seeing is relatively non-noticable, giving the impression that most women, if they let their hair grow out, will have relatively non-noticable hair too.

Growing increased amounts of body hair while in a cast or similar device is a common occurrence. This is probably an unusual amount of leg hair even for this woman.

710,"It is not accurate (based on that study) to say most men prefer smaller labia or that most men do not like larger labia (or even that they have the very specific vulva preferences you list here). 

That study does not support your statements about men's preferences. In that study, 36% of men were neutral about genital appearance. They don't give the percentage of men who preferred smaller labia, just that more preferred smaller labia than larger labia. This does not mean that **most** men prefer smaller labia--after all, if 36% of men were neutral, that only leaves 64% of men that have a preference in either direction. The makeup of how many of those men preferred smaller to larger is not specified there (it could be 34% smaller to 30% larger, for example--leaving most men without a preference) nor is the strength of the preferences listed (strong preference versus mild).

Definitely gonna check out that article and look up the disorder. I really appreciate you sharing that information. My GYN handles my contraceptives, but she and my psychiatrist would probably both want to know and discuss the possibility if I suspect anything following my reading. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I have it considering my litany of other health problems which all revolve around abnormal hormone and neurotransmitter levels. I‚Äôm actually on an SSRI and used to be able to raise my dosage slightly around my TOM to help control the psychiatric symptoms I get or have worse around that time, but unfortunately I can‚Äôt anymore because of a high risk of delayed-onset serotonin syndrome, which can be very dangerous if allowed to persist.

I‚Äôm actually 29 right now which is why I have so much uncertainty around whether or not I want to have children. -shrugs- I‚Äôm also very wary of getting something inserted under my skin. I‚Äôd probably have an anxiety attack or faint during the procedure. üòÖSo I don‚Äôt want to commit to that until I‚Äôm sure just to avoid the emotional stress.

I hope you spoil the hell out of all those kids *especially* since it‚Äôs not your problem if they annoy their parents afterwards.","I just asked my mum and she said her sister always had truly awful PMS symptoms but she was only diagnosed in her late 30 - after she chased someone with a knife üòß It‚Äôs called Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and she was put on a ‚Äúmood stabiliser‚Äù (my mums term - I suspect she means SSRI or barbiturate) as well as multiple forms of contraception. 

If you think you might have PMDD you should definitely bring it up with your GP. [This article might be of interest to you. ](https://journals.lww.com/indianjpsychiatry/Fulltext/2020/62050/Menstrual_psychosis__A_not_so_forgotten_reality.21.aspx) in terms of people thinking you‚Äôre a hypochondriac - particularly the case study of the woman who‚Äôs in-laws thought she was faking it and stopped treatment until she tried to harm their son. Seriously, wtf? 

And just a side note regarding ‚Äúmore potent birth control‚Äù, the implant is particularly good because your cycle returns to normal within a month of the implant being removed. It‚Äôs not more potent, just longer lasting for ease. It‚Äôs also more expensive because it‚Äôs longer lasting. In the UK they won‚Äôt put a woman on the implant if she has any intention of getting pregnant in the next 3 years because it‚Äôs a waste of NHS money to remove it again when shorter term methods are available. If you have really good private health insurance, I imagine this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Also, birth control isn‚Äôt measured in potency - consistent pill usage, IUD and implants all have the same ‚Äúpotency‚Äù in terms of you not getting pregnant (within 1-2%). The only issue is non reversible methods - injection rather than implant or pill, for example. You can‚Äôt take an injection out or stop taking it, you have to wait the 3 months until it‚Äôs warn off. 

If you definitely don‚Äôt want to have a child in the next 3 years, get the implant. It doesn‚Äôt impact your long term fertility levels or anything like that. And if for some reason you don‚Äôt like it/it causes side effects/you suddenly decided you want to have a baby right now, you can just have it removed and be good to go in 4 weeks. 

Thank you for the good wishes! When I was 28-33ish and every single person I knew was having children, it was awful. I‚Äôd sob in the bath after each pregnancy announcement, despite being beyond happy for my friends. My partner and I are nearing 40 now and we love having lots of little people in our lives that we can enjoy spending time with - and then give back!!","Damn. The way most people would react to me/treated me during & around my periods before I went onto the 3-month cycle of contraceptives, I always was under the impression that my severe instability and hyperarousal (refering to emotional state, not horniness lmao) was me being ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù, at least until I looked into it myself and realize that everyone else was just being an asshole because clearly if you‚Äôre the only one *obviously* going mental because of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hormone fluctuations, you must be a hypochrondriac or attention whore, right?

I‚Äôm glad your aunt got relief from her PMS-triggered psychosis when she went on contraceptives and then finally when she hit menopause. It‚Äôs insane what our bodies do to us. It really is. I agree wholeheartedly that periods suck.

I haven‚Äôt decided yet if I want to try to have kids. I do know that if I do, I‚Äôll definitely go on a more potent form of contraceptive than the pill I am currently on after one or two and that will be the end of it. I sometimes wonder of I‚Äôm even fertile, though. I have a feeling conceiving may prove difficult if I decided to try.

I‚Äôm sorry that you are unable to have children, but I‚Äôm also glad that at this point it‚Äôs also no longer an problem to you!","That sounds fucking awful for you. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with that - but I‚Äôm really glad you had a doctor that listened and now you (only) have to suffer that 4 times a year. It‚Äôs still too much, but better than nothing. 

My aunt had PMS psychosis (not sure of the correct term) and it nearly destroyed her life. It wasn‚Äôt the sensation or smell like for you, her PMS literally made her insane. The kindest, sweetest person you could imagine would morph into a monster - she‚Äôd literally plot people‚Äôs murder over the smallest slight. It was terrifying. They put her on the copper IUD + mini pill while she was still menstruating and it help a lot. Menopause is the only thing that‚Äôs completely removed the psychotic thoughts/behaviours though. 

I‚Äôve been on contraception for almost as long as I‚Äôve been menstruating (very late puberty) and I sometimes wonder how different my body would feel without BC. But not for too long. Periods suck. I can‚Äôt have children, and although it‚Äôs taken a while, I‚Äôm now happy not to have them (I‚Äôm nearing 40) so why should I have to put up with painful, inconvenient, costly periods when they can safely be stopped?!","My GYN actually agreed to switch me to a 3-month cycle about 5 or so years back after discussing it with her. My quality of life goes to shit whenever I have a period, so reducing it to 4 times a year was a massive boon to me. Don‚Äôt need to worry about the sensations of menstruating and feeling or smelling my own menses making me feel psychotic and angry or deal with severe PMS, heavy bleeding or cramping anymore since even the 4x a year are usually so light as to not even care now.

If your doctor is reasonable and there‚Äôs no barriers to getting treatment (such as health insurance approval) to worry about, your doctor will give you what you need to improve the quality of your life. If they refuse without a valid explanation, get a new doctor. There‚Äôs no real biological need to have a period once a month - or at all, really - if you aren‚Äôt trying to get pregnant.

(‚ÄúYou/Your‚Äù = whoever reads this comment.)","I had a typo in that comment - I‚Äôm on the contraceptive implant (implanon I think it‚Äôs called) and the mini pill. Both are progesterone only because I have lupus. My first implant I had at 18 didn‚Äôt stop my periods completely, the second one did, the third didn‚Äôt so they added the mini pill in an attempt to stop them completely (I have PoTS too and my periods make that illness so much worse). It‚Äôs been 6 years since I had a period or spotting and it‚Äôs been a joy! 

I‚Äôm not sure if doctors will prescribe contraception to stop menstruation completely if it‚Äôs not medically necessary, but implanon + mini pill is the way to go if can persuade a doctor in my experience.",If you don't mind me asking - what pill do you use? I always have troubles with bleeding randomly on the pill and it's becoming really annoying.,"The mess (on him) makes me a bit embarrassed/grossed out. Not because he‚Äôs shamed me in anyway, it just personally makes me a bit uncomfortable so I used to skip it.

Edit contraceptive implant & mini pill, not just mini pill."

719,"NO! Tearing during first inter course isn‚Äôt normal at all. Thats the whole reason were bring up how this concept of breaking the hymen is harmful. Thanks for proving my point. 

There is absolutely no reason for there to be any tearing pain or bleeding during first inter course. No more than any other time someone has sex. It takes time, communication, emotional and physical comfort, and arousal and ther will be no pain (unless the person is an anomaly and has a condition that causes pain during sex). 

If there is pain during a persons first time then they have not taken the time to establish the above factors so the woman is not READY. She needs more lubrication and her muscles to relax more. 

The first time I had sex it hurt a little when we tried and I said that and my partner stopped and went back to fingering me until there was no pain when we went for it. It is completely unnecessary  and honestly barbaric for it to be normalized that a woman has tissue damage causing pain and bleeding the first time she has sex when neither are normal or necessary in any way.

Lol your saying virginity is stupid while defending the concept that has been used to uphold and create and validate  the concept of Virginity for thousands of years through virginity checks and the concept that the first time a woman has sex it is different than other times and results in pain or bleeding. Because ther is a physical change that takes place and makes it so there‚Äôs no pain or bleeding in the future and this change is observable and proof of lost virginity. It‚Äôs all bullshit. 


Anyways. Girls: if anyone ever tells you pain or bleeding during sex is normal your first time they are wrong. They are lying. There should never be unwanted pain or bleeding during sex. If there is.

720,"Nah. It‚Äôs not normal that when I was in high school and most of my friends were having sex for the first time. We would sit and talk and every girls story was the same. That it hurt SO bad they were crying and got blood on the sheets. Every girl saying it was horrible, they were so scared, it hurt so bad. Every single one of us was under the impression that it hurt the first time you had sex for an anatomical reason. That that was normal and was related to the hymen myth. 

It doesn‚Äôt need to hurt the first time you have sex and it only does if the man isn‚Äôt making sure that their partner is aroused and ready before they stick it in. Why do men get to universally enjoy their first time but for woman it‚Äôs  ok that it‚Äôs painful even when there‚Äôs no reason it has to be besides the guy couldn‚Äôt wait to get his dick wet and/or both parties didn‚Äôt know that if they just waited and worked up to it more the girl would relax and get wetter and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt. 

The first time I had sex I said it was hurting so m partner stopped and went back to fingering me more and went down on me and then we tried again and it didn‚Äôt hurt anymore. That could have been the story of every one of my friends too instead of a bloody horror story if they had known that what they went through wasn‚Äôt necessary, wasn‚Äôt related to anatomy or their hymen, and shouldn‚Äôt be fucking normal. 

It shouldn‚Äôt be normal or expected for women to have pain and bleeding the first time they have sex. That‚Äôs fucking barbaric. Like sorry no one told you and you had to go through that but it doesn‚Äôt mean generations more of women and girls do. Idk why you would want to perpetuate the idea that it‚Äôs normal just so you can feel ok about your first time at the expense of every other girls coming after you. Like I‚Äôm truly sorry to you that you had to go through that and didn‚Äôt have a partner who said oh if it hurts then I want to stop and let‚Äôs make you more comfortable or aroused. Sorry you didn‚Äôt get to enjoy your first time without pain. 

You are bending over backwards to try to explain why it‚Äôs ok for women to have their first time be painful and bloody. None of that matter when it‚Äôs a completely addressable issue. And you‚Äôre arguing against providing women the information they need to know to address it just bc ur vagina randomly bleeds sometimes like Jesus get so perspective. So what. None of the shit you said changes the fact that women bleeding and experiencing pain the first time they have sex can be solved by just slowing down and helping the girl get more comfortable. Which is also great bc if she‚Äôs physically uncomfortable like that she‚Äôs probably mentally u comfortable to. And will enjoy herself way more of she‚Äôs able to relax. Sorry I want women to enjoy their first time. 

But just because you had to go through something shitty trying to normalize it so that other people have to go through it too is a really fucked up thing to do. You‚Äôre literally saying that I‚Äôm shaming you by saying that women shouldn‚Äôt experience pain and bleeding the first time they have sex. This has nothing to do about anything but your own selfishness and needing to justify your own experience even if it means hurting other people. Ok got it.","It‚Äôs completely normal. A lot of people don‚Äôt really know their bodies at that point and don‚Äôt really know how important foreplay is so they just go for it without making sure there‚Äôs proper lubrication and so on. It‚Äôs not ideal, but it‚Äôs certainly *normal.* 

In a perfect world we‚Äôd have people be super careful and prepared every time we have sex, but that‚Äôs not a thing that exists, lol. It‚Äôs completely normal to tear. I think you need to look up the word ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Hell, I‚Äôm 34 and sometimes I jump into a quickie too fast before I‚Äôm fully prepared and even I‚Äôll tear. It‚Äôs normal and I‚Äôm fine with it, lol. Inexperienced people get just as impatient as experienced people do sometimes, and *that‚Äôs completely normal.* You‚Äôre sort of living in a delusional world where you seem to think sex should exist within a utopian vacuum where everything is always prepared and perfect and innately knowledgeable and that‚Äôs simply not practical. 

Is it avoidable? Yes, sure. Are people always actually going to do what they need to avoid it? No. Losing my virginity personally didn‚Äôt hurt at all because I was suuuuuper ‚Äúready‚Äù for it, but since then there have been times sex does hurt because like I said, quickies or whatever.

I totally agree it shouldn‚Äôt be normalized and it‚Äôs barbaric that there are still cultures where a girl/woman has to prove she‚Äôs a virgin by bleeding on the sheets on her wedding night, but that‚Äôs not even what I‚Äôm talking about here. Just in general it happens, and (I cannot stress this enough) *it‚Äôs normal.* Just as *it‚Äôs normal* to NOT bleed or tear the first time. People need to stop seeing this in black and white.

And your little edit at the end to ‚Äúgirls‚Äù is way overarching. Sometimes I get random bleeding from my uterus after particularly rambunctious sex and that‚Äôs normal for some women, at least according to every gynecologist I‚Äôve ever spoken to. Some of us do that when we get jostled. Stuff happens. As I stated, sex doesn‚Äôt exist in some utopian vacuum.

If you read up on it, it's pretty interesting. Big push for hair removal equaling femininity started during the Victorian Era (1837-1901) and really picked up after that. What caused the biggest push after 1900's? Capitalism my friend.

Gillette and other major brands started pushing hygiene products in woman's magazines. It was so successful they sold over 90k in the first year in US (big number back then). Quote: Hansen, a researcher on the topic, ""The practice of removing hair from the underarms and legs was practically unheard of."" She goes on, ""In fact, hair removal was such a novel concept when it was first introduced that companies had to persuade women of the benefits of hair removal, and demonstrate how to practice it.""

That being said, at 42, growing up with two older sisters to boot - hair in the under arms disgusts me. Part conditioning, part upbringing, and simply what everyone around me has always said.

I don't think I'm obligated to change this anymore than a woman is obligated to shave. It's just another PR campaign to draw attention, distraction, and entertainment. I wouldn't date a woman who didn't shave, just my ingrained personal opinion.

Far as under arm hair for guys vs girls - I've explained ad nauseam at this point why I and the bulk majority think this way. It's not some secret or sexist pact to keep women down. Started religious, ended up a way to make a quick buck.

Too bad he‚Äôs too dense to see it.","Why is a woman's armpit hair ""disgusting"" and ""offensive"" but yours isn't?","My own pits or my own PR campaign? 

If it's the former, sure I would shave my pits if my wife didn't like it. Other than the shear convince of not doing it, I really feel no strong opinion to it personally. Clothing I wear daily you're not seeing my pits.

If it's the latter, no I have no wish to push my opinion on anyone else. It's simply the body hair norm - I stated what I'm attracted to, but that doesn't prevent you from following your own wishes. What I find attractive and why shouldn't offend you.",I‚Äôm assuming you mean your own as well?,"It's more of a societal issue then a 'natural' issue. They're well aware women can grow hair, but shouldn't.

If you read up on it, it's pretty interesting. Big push for hair removal equaling femininity started during the Victorian Era (1837-1901) and really picked up after that. What caused the biggest push after 1900's? Capitalism my friend.

Gillette and other major brands started pushing hygiene products in woman's magazines. It was so successful they sold over 90k in the first year in US (big number back then). Quote: Hansen, a researcher on the topic, ""The practice of removing hair from the underarms and legs was practically unheard of."" She goes on, ""In fact, hair removal was such a novel concept when it was first introduced that companies had to persuade women of the benefits of hair removal, and demonstrate how to practice it.""

That being said, at 42, growing up with two older sisters to boot - hair in the under arms disgusts me. Part conditioning, part upbringing, and simply what everyone around me has always said.

I don't think I'm obligated to change this anymore than a woman is obligated to shave. It's just another PR campaign to draw attention, distraction, and entertainment. I wouldn't date a woman who didn't shave, just my ingrained personal opinion. I'm assuming there are others who will.",It‚Äôs so disappointing that there are people walking around who unironically believe women are not meant to naturally grow hair.

766,Thank you for that I need to subscribe to her. I always forget to,"You are very welcome! The ""Momma Doctor Jones"" YouTube channel is packed full of important and useful information regarding us females. She is an OBGYN, and she goes over everything from periods and birth control, to the different ways of having babies. And then there's her running ""reaction"" videos of the TV show ""I didn't know I was Pregnant"" which is so stinking hilarious!",Thank you so very much.,"If you're in the US, the Thinx brand is really good. If you're in Canada, I'm pretty certain they ship there as well. I haven't had to worry about that stuff in about 10 years, so I personally never tried them as they weren't prevalent on the market yet. That being said, I have a friend, and my eldest daughter that uses them. My friend is on the heavier side of things, and she LOVES them, at night especially. She doesn't leak past the front or back of the over night pads anymore, because they couldn't ""reach perfectly"" to both front and back. My 16 yr old daughter uses them mostly after she is home from school and on weekends and overnights. She prefers them to pads on her underwear, even the ""ultra thin"" ones. We have discovered she has a sensitivity to something in multiple brands of pads, and is flat out allergic to the scented ones. (I accidently bought them one month, and she said she would try them. That ended BADLY.) Her skin in that area is a lot happier as well. 

There is another option you can do as well. I know for sure they're made on Etsy. It resembles a pair of regular panties, or the Thinx, but it has removable, reusable inserts that vary is size based on flow I believe. I saw them also on ""Momma Doctor Jones"" video talking about what the different things are for menstrual cycles. When it's full, and it's time to change it, if you're out and about, you can carry a roll of baggies, like people have for if their dog poops, and use one of those for the liner. When you get home, you rinse in cold water, and put into laundry to wash it. (I learned the doggy bag trick when I was doing cloth diapers.)

Cowardice and apathy is why. To the average lefty, someone else pumping a toddler full of drugs doesn't affect their lives, so they don't care enough to do or say anything about it. And those that *do* speak out are exiled from the ideological tribe.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Bret Weinstein were originally LibCenters, who by speaking out against the left-wing extremists, were exiled from the tribe. The right-wing then promptly offered them a welcoming home, where ideological disagreements are plentiful, but rarely rising to the level of resulting in excommunication.

If the left doesn't want to be associated with these child abusing monsters, then they need to accept their exile collectively and move to greener pastures, like what Dave Rubin did.","I don't get it, why won't they do some housekeeping?

The fossil record shows 30 year olds from a thousand years ago with the kind of illness indicators and deterioration you'd expect to see in someone twice that age today.

A totalitarian government is not a government of the people. The people in Nazi Germany could not chose who was in government, they had no say on its policies. Hitler was very very very very famously a dictator. HE owned the means of production, not the workers.

If you assert that fascism is socialist because the ""government"" owned the economy, then by the same logic, feudalism and monarchism are both ""socialism"" too.

Fundamentally socialism is a form of democracy, where the workers in the economy have control over that economy. So any system like fascism that takes control away from the workers and puts it into the hands of a select few, cannot be socialism.","*sigh*

Weird because the link you posted below mentions:

> (63.3%) of the boys met the DSM-III, III-R, or IV criteria for gender identity disorder;

Which is a pretty comprehensive criteria for identifiying GID
https://www.cpath.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ZUCKERDSM.pdf

And as for that actually study, yeah that looks pretty solid, but a few points I should mention

12% were noted as persisters, that is not ""so low that effectively there are no trans children.""

And the study itself gives a lot of extra details about that number.


> In Steensma et al. (51), the DSM-IV-TR criteria were used. Of the 23 persisters, 21 (91.3%) met the criteria for GID; in contrast, only 22 (39.3%) of the 56 desisters were threshold for the diagnosis, suggesting an even more substantial difference in the threshold-subthreshold distinction than was found in Wallien and Cohen-Kettenis


So when a stricter criteria is used so that less kids are considered ""sub threshold"" then that number goes up dramatically.

This references studies that were done before the diagnosis of gender dysphoria even existed. 

At the time, they used gender identity disorder, which wasn't just a different name for the same disorder, it had notably more relaxed diagnostic criteria. It was considered a behavioral disorder, which could be met simply through gender nonconformity. In fact, these studies and their findings are referenced as guiding factors for the diagnostic criteria change that came with introducing gender dysphoria in the DSM-V.

Additionally, even with that more relaxed criteria, many children still did not meet the criteria. 30%-40% of kids (depending on the study) did not meet criteria for a diagnosis. Meaning there was nothing to persist from in the first place. Yet they were included in these ""desistance"" rates. 

Another limitation is the timeframe of these diagnoses, because they'd be done once at an average age of 7 then again after puberty. 

That is not relevant to modern medical diagnosis. Kids are evaluated up to tanner stage 2 of puberty and only then if they've exhibited persistent gender dysphoria are they even eligible for any kind of medical intervention. 

So even if some portion do genuinely desist, the implication that it's puberty that causes it rather than them desisting prior to puberty is pure conjecture. 

> Leuprolide acetate is a common puberty blocker which is used to chemically castrate people

You do realize that you can get pleasure without PIV sex, yeah? But engaging in that specific type of sex risks a child. You consented to that risk. You accept the consequences. And murdering that child because you *chose* to accept that risk and then changed your mind is unacceptable.

>amount of coercion, financial instability before or during a pregnancy, failed contraceptives, medical problems or big life events like global warming and war

Legs open or legs closed.  Dick in the pants or out.  Both parties can consent or not consent, and the simple solutions are: a) don't do PIV or b) don't have sex at all. Murdering a child because you failed to prepare financially is not acceptable. Failed contraceptives are a risk of the contract, murder is not an acceptable alternative.

And those special exceptions aren't limited to rape.  I merely used that in the framing of *consensual* in my previous comment. War is a good reason. Can't support a baby if you're being attacked. Medical complications that may kill the mother is also a good reason.

And you're really gonna call ""climate change"" a good reason for murder?

>There's no contract between living developed humans and barely developed clusters of skin cells.

Yes there is. You consented to the risk, you must deal with the consequences. You could have easily *not* accepted the risk by doing options A or B above. Actions have consequences and murder is not justified unless your life is in danger, just like self defense. Hence the special exceptions listed above.

>every doctor around them refuses to treat their life threatening medical conditions

But every doctor isn't refusing. Hypothetical: what if *every* doctor refused on conscience? Would you coerce them? You do not have a right to abortions. Just as healthcare is not a right. *Nothing* that relies on the labor of another is a right.

You have a right to *seek* healthcare, including abortions. And to be painfully clear and unambiguous: **I support a woman's right to choose**. I will *never* support weaponizing the govt against people for what drugs they do or don't want to take, what guns they want to own, who they want to associate with, etc.

*But* I will always advocate for life. I will always try to find a solution that doesn't involve murdering that child.","> Did a man and a woman willfully and consensually

Hey monke, did you know that sex feels good and people do it just because it feels good and is a free source of happiness & exercise? It's pretty much the most monke logic in existence and I'm unsure why I need to explain it.

> it means you are accepting the risk of a pregnancy

Which is to travel as far as needed to get abortions. That's what rich people who don't give a fuck will do in states where abortion is banned when they don't want an unexpected fetus weighing down their kids futures.

> You've entered into a contract

No you haven't. Nobody ever has or ever will. There's no contract between living developed humans and barely developed clusters of skin cells. Even if there was, it would be nullified in any court just like someone trying to farm your kidney because you signed a piece of paper.

> And murder is not an acceptable solution just because you suddenly changed your mind.

It is if it's a parasite. Even actual monkeys know parasites are undesirable.

> * Rape is an obvious special exception.

Took a few more years to realise that cis people also usually feel gender as an innate feeling inside them, and that *not feeling like you have a gender* is an innately trans experience.

840,That‚Äôs an interesting thought. Fingers and toes might look strange if we didn‚Äôt grow up seeing them all the time.,I just thought of an interesting question.

We don‚Äôt see them everyday of our lives since we were babies and until we die. Maybe they just look strange to anyone because they aren‚Äôt out there all the time.

My insertion was definitly painful (like a really bad period cramp), but the strong pain is really quickly over. Not even a minute, as I remember it. For the rest of the day I had light to medium cramps similar to the start of my period, so i recommend not planning to do anything for the rest the day of the insertion.

For me personally that amount of pain is totally worth it for 5 years of very save but hormone-free contraception. But notice that I am not generally anxious about painfull medical procedures. I don't enjoy them for sure, but I don't feel fear or anxiety before it, so maybe this does not apply to you. Also I have had bad period pain for years, so I am kinda used to this kind of pain."

893,"Interesting. 

Now there is more to learn and to read about because my mind isnt capable of finding peace when i have questions. 

If by casuality someone that knows about science, psychology, neurology or anything could come and teach us a few things about this conversation, i would be happy.","Personally, I'm not asexual, but not strictly allosexual either (autistic, demisexual etc.). I used to be somewhat repulsed by genitals despite very open upbringing, no religious or moral baggage, no trauma, good education. Heck, I grew up pagan with the whole feminist mother nature vulva/phallus worship slant. 

Exposure in both the sexual sense and non-sexual (naturist) setting alleviated that, but it's kinda ""Schr√∂dinger's neutral"" - I'm simultaneously indifferent, positive (in a theoretical appreciation way) and repulsed. I'm not sex-repulsed, so that allowed me positive interaction with genitals. A sex-repulsed asexual doesn't have that option, and even my ""training myself"" didn't fully remove the negative undercurrent. The social construct aspect is salvageable, and that would be sufficient for the majority of people, but the brain wiring isn't.","Im not certain about that. I've been working in a naturist camping. People hang out completely naked. Genitals then lose their ""sacred, sexual, hidden, whatever"" character. I strongly believe it is a social construct.

Obviously, when things get hot between persons, sex get sexy, but when having a coffee, it doesnt.

Where does repulsion come from ? Isnt it construction we made (conscient or inconscient) through our education ? I think it is something we learn to be, not native. 

>no amount of education is going to help a sex-repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.

You're probably right. I guess its too late for them, and learning not to be repulsed would be a hard work that i'm not sure they would want to do if they are ok like this. But i was talking before that. When we are children. 

And i'm reaaaally not saying being asexual is a problem that should be cured. I have nothing to say about asexuality (or any form of sexuality or asexuality) as long as people are happy with it. My concern is only about being repulsed by body parts. Concern being a big word here.","But the genitals do have a sexual connotation, no amount of education is going to help a sex-repulsed ace be neutral about them if their repulsion goes beyond the act itself.","Well it is just my opinion and i'm not going to force it. 

I feel that any human should know the basic human anatomy, without disgust at all. We should be able to comprehend it without putting in any sexual aspect. But once again it is just my opinion, not backed by any science. But i feel people would be more relax about it if we could just see it as we see arms or ears. No emotions, just plain and cold.

See, im a hetero man, i have no attraction for men, but I can watch a male or female organ with no disgust, and even tell people if there's something wrong like a visible skin disease, and tell them to go get checked.

But it is my way of seeing life. I'm really convinced people should know more about anatomy. We hide everything so much that it becomes like a secret, it gets mystical for some, and creates frustration, bad behaviour and so on, just because. I really feel if we would just treat organs as we do for ears, some problems would be avoided. Not all, obviously, but some.

Once again, only my opinion, not forcing it. I'm curious about yours, if you mind explaining. I wont tell you're wrong or im right, i would just understand other people's opinions better, and that is very good.",Why would it matter if you‚Äôre attracted or repulsed by them if you‚Äôre not going to be near them or dictate what people should do because of what you believe.,"Its ok to be asexual, but I don't find it ok to be repulsed by human body parts. If you remove sex, there still is basic biology, anatomy, plain and cold.",People gotta learn that it‚Äôs okay to be asexual.
